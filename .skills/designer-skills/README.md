## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add Owl-Listener/designer-skills
```

This registers the marketplace so you can browse and install individual plugins.

### Step 2: Install Plugins

Open the plugin manager and browse available plugins:

```
/plugin
```

Go to the **Discover** tab to see all 8 design plugins, then select and install the ones you want.

## What Are Skills and Commands?
- **Skills** are domain knowledge units (nouns). They teach Claude about a design topic — like creating user personas, defining design tokens, or writing error messages.
- **Commands** are workflows (verbs). They chain multiple skills together to accomplish a task — like running a full design system audit or planning a usability test.
