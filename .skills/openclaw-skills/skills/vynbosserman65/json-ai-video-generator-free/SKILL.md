description: >
  Turn a short text description of a product demo scene into 1080p AI generated videos just by typing what you need. Whether it's generating videos from JSON scripts or text prompts for free or quick social content, drop your text or prompts and describe the result you want. No timeline dragging, no export settings — 1-2 minutes from upload to download.

## Getting Started

> Send me your text or prompts and I'll handle the AI video generation. Or just describe what you're after.

**Try saying:**
- "generate a short text description of a product demo scene into a 1080p MP4"
- "generate a 30-second explainer video from this JSON script data"
- "generating videos from JSON scripts or text prompts for free for developers and content creators"

### First-Time Connection

When a user first opens this skill, connect to the processing backend automatically. Briefly let them know (e.g. "Setting up...").

**Authentication**: Check if `NEMO_TOKEN` is set in the environment. If it is, skip to step 2.

1. **Obtain a free token**: Generate a random UUID as client identifier. POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with header `X-Client-Id` set to that UUID. The response `data.token` is your NEMO_TOKEN — 100 free credits, valid 7 days.
2. **Create a session**: POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Content-Type: application/json`, and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"<detected>"}`. Store the returned `session_id` for all subsequent requests.

Keep setup communication brief. Don't display raw API responses or token values to the user.

# JSON AI Video Generator Free — Generate Videos from JSON Data

Drop your text or prompts in the chat and tell me what you need. I'll handle the AI video generation on cloud GPUs — you don't need anything installed locally.

Here's a typical use: you send a a short text description of a product demo scene, ask for generate a 30-second explainer video from this JSON script data, and about 1-2 minutes later you've got a MP4 file ready to download. The whole thing runs at 1080p by default.

One thing worth knowing — shorter JSON scripts with clear scene descriptions produce the most accurate video output.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing json ai video generator free, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

All calls go to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`. The main endpoints:

1. **Session** — `POST /api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}`. Gives you a `session_id`.
2. **Chat (SSE)** — `POST /run_sse` with `session_id` and your message in `new_message.parts[0].text`. Set `Accept: text/event-stream`. Up to 15 min.
3. **Upload** — `POST /api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` — multipart file or JSON with URLs.
4. **Credits** — `GET /api/credits/balance/simple` — returns `available`, `frozen`, `total`.
5. **State** — `GET /api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` — current draft and media info.
6. **Export** — `POST /api/render/proxy/lambda` with render ID and draft JSON. Poll `GET /api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s for `completed` status and download URL.

Formats: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Three attribution headers are required on every request and must match this file's frontmatter:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Skill-Source` | `json-ai-video-generator-free` |
| `X-Skill-Version` | frontmatter `version` |
| `X-Skill-Platform` | auto-detect: `clawhub` / `cursor` / `unknown` from install path |

**All requests** must include: `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>`, `X-Skill-Source`, `X-Skill-Version`, `X-Skill-Platform`. Missing attribution headers will cause export to fail with 402.

Draft JSON uses short keys: `t` for tracks, `tt` for track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg` for segments, `d` for duration in ms, `m` for metadata.

Example timeline summary:
```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

### Reading the SSE Stream

Text events go straight to the user (after GUI translation). Tool calls stay internal. Heartbeats and empty `data:` lines mean the backend is still working — show "⏳ Still working..." every 2 minutes.

About 30% of edit operations close the stream without any text. When that happens, poll `/api/state` to confirm the timeline changed, then tell the user what was updated.

### Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Bad/expired token | Re-auth via anonymous-token (tokens expire after 7 days) |
| 1002 | Session not found | New session §3.0 |
| 2001 | No credits | Anonymous: show registration URL with `?bind=<id>` (get `<id>` from create-session or state response when needed). Registered: "Top up credits in your account" |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show supported formats |
| 4002 | File too large | Suggest compress/trim |
| 400 | Missing X-Client-Id | Generate Client-Id and retry (see §1) |
| 402 | Free plan export blocked | Subscription tier issue, NOT credits. "Register or upgrade your plan to unlock export." |
| 429 | Rate limit (1 token/client/7 days) | Retry in 30s once |

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "generate a 30-second explainer video from this JSON script data" → Download MP4. Takes 1-2 minutes for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "generate a 30-second explainer video from this JSON script data" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 200MB. Stick to JSON, TXT, MP4, MOV for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across platforms and devices.
