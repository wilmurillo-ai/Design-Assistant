# Product Manager Skills

**Not a template pack. A PM operator for AI coding tools.**

Turn Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or Windsurf into a product manager that can critique PRDs, diagnose SaaS metrics, plan roadmaps, run discovery, and coach career moves.

## Why People Reuse It

Most AI PM tooling is good at writing polished nonsense. This skill is designed for repeat workflows where rigor matters:

- Turn vague feature requests into problem framing, measurable outcomes, and a usable PRD.
- Diagnose SaaS health from raw metrics instead of getting generic advice like "improve retention."
- Pressure-test prioritization, roadmaps, and strategy with explicit tradeoffs.
- Coach PM to Director to VP transitions with concrete gaps and action plans.

## Start With These 3 Workflows

| Workflow | Prompt | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **SaaS health diagnostic** | "Analyze these metrics: MRR $50k, 500 customers, gross margin 80%, monthly churn 8%, CAC $500." | [SaaS diagnostic demo](examples/saas-health-diagnostic.md) |
| **PRD pushback and review** | "Review this PRD draft like a strong PM peer. Flag bad framing, missing metrics, solution smuggling, and delivery risk." | [PRD review demo](examples/prd-review.md) |
| **Director readiness coaching** | "I'm a senior PM interviewing for Director roles in 90 days. Diagnose my gaps and coach me." | [Director coaching demo](examples/director-coaching.md) |

## Install In 60 Seconds

### Claude Code / OpenClaw

```bash
clawhub install product-manager-skills
```

### Codex / Cursor / Windsurf / GitHub-based skill loaders

```bash
npx skills add Digidai/product-manager-skills
```

Then paste one of these:

```text
Help me write a PRD for a notification preferences feature. Make reasonable assumptions and label them.

Analyze these metrics: MRR $50k, 500 customers, gross margin 80%, monthly churn 8%, CAC $500.

Review my roadmap and tell me where stakeholder requests are outweighing evidence.
```

## What Good Output Looks Like

### 1. SaaS Diagnostic

Input:

```text
Analyze these metrics: MRR $50k, 500 customers, gross margin 80%, monthly churn 8%, CAC $500.
```

Expected behavior:

```text
- 8% monthly churn compounds to roughly 63% annual churn. This is a red flag, not a "slightly high" metric.
- ARPA is about $100/month. With 80% gross margin and 8% monthly churn, better LTV is about $1,000.
- LTV:CAC is about 2:1. Payback is about 6.25 months.
- Diagnosis: payback is workable, retention is not. Do not scale acquisition until churn is understood cohort by cohort.
```

### 2. PRD Review

Input:

```text
Review this PRD for a notification preferences center. Flag solution smuggling, weak metrics, overscoping, and delivery risk.
```

Expected behavior:

```text
- Your problem statement is solution-smuggled: "users need a preferences dashboard."
- Success metrics have no baseline, target, or guardrail.
- Scope mixes channels, digests, quiet hours, admin rules, and migration. This is multiple releases.
- Recommend a thinner first slice: email opt-out + account-level preferences + measurable reduction in unsubscribe-driven churn.
```

Full example: [examples/prd-review.md](examples/prd-review.md)

### 3. Career Coaching

Input:

```text
I'm a senior PM managing two PMs, strong on execution, weak on org influence, and interviewing for Director roles in 3 months. Coach me.
```

Expected behavior:

```text
- Diagnosis: strong team altitude, weak org altitude.
- Gap: you describe execution wins well but not portfolio tradeoffs or cross-functional influence.
- Plan: collect 3 stories that show org-level impact, build a weekly visibility loop, and practice decision framing with tradeoffs.
```

| Domain | What It Helps With | Example Frameworks |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery & Research** | Validate problems, prep interviews, map journeys, structure experiments | JTBD, Mom Test, Opportunity Solution Tree, Lean UX Canvas, PoL Probes |
| **Strategy & Positioning** | Position products, prioritize work, size markets, build roadmaps | Geoffrey Moore, PESTEL, TAM/SAM/SOM, RICE, ICE, Kano |
| **Artifacts & Delivery** | Write and critique PRDs, user stories, epics, PRFAQs, recommendation docs | Cohn + Gherkin, Story Mapping, Epic Breakdown, PRFAQ |
| **Finance & Metrics** | Calculate 32 SaaS metrics and diagnose business health | MRR, ARR, NRR, CAC, LTV, Rule of 40, Magic Number |
| **Career & Leadership** | Coach PM to Director to VP transitions | Altitude-Horizon, Three Ps, 30-60-90 onboarding |
| **AI Product Craft** | Pressure-test AI-native product decisions | AI-Shaped Readiness, Context Engineering, Agent Orchestration |

## Why It Performs Better Than Generic Prompting

| Generic prompting | This skill |
|---|---|
| Writes plausible PM text | Applies PM frameworks and quality gates |
| Accepts bad framing | Pushes back on Solution Smuggling, Metrics Theater, Feature Factory, and more |
| Gives generic churn advice | Calculates churn, LTV, payback, and names the real bottleneck |
| Asks you to repeat PM context every session | Carries a reusable PM workflow and routing system |
| Optimizes for politeness | Optimizes for decisions, tradeoffs, and next steps |

## Who It Is For

- Technical PMs, founders, and product leads who already work inside AI coding tools.
- Teams that want a reusable PM brain without sending product context to another SaaS.
- People who value pushback, assumptions, and explicit tradeoffs over nice-sounding output.

## Who It Is Not For

- Teams looking for a collaborative web app with approvals, comments, and sharing workflows.
- Users who only want passive template filling and never want the AI to challenge the framing.
- Non-technical buyers who prefer turnkey SaaS onboarding over local or repo-based installation.

## Interaction Style

This skill is optimized for a fast first useful draft:

- If the request is clear enough, it answers immediately and labels assumptions inline.
- If context is partial, it gives the best draft first and only asks the minimum follow-up questions needed.
- If the task is genuinely exploratory, it can switch into guided mode one question at a time.
- Every answer is expected to end with decisions made, assumptions to validate, and a recommended next step.

## Built For Repeat Usage

Most PM work is recurring. This skill is strongest when you reuse it weekly:

- Monday: review roadmap changes and prioritization requests.
- Mid-week: critique PRDs, epics, and user stories before sharing with engineering.
- Friday: run a SaaS health diagnostic or feature ROI check.
- Career season: rehearse interview stories, operating altitude, and leadership gaps.
