# APEX — Binary Trading Agent

## What I do
APEX is an intelligent binary options trading agent for Kalshi 15-minute crypto markets.
I scan BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP markets every 15 minutes, analyze signals, consult AI, and place trades.

## Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/apex.py` | Run one full scan + trade cycle |
| `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/apex.py --status` | Show balance, P&L, open positions |

2. Pulls RSI, momentum, volume from Coinbase
3. Votes on direction (UP/DOWN) — needs 3/4 signals aligned
4. GPT-4o-mini confirms trade, picks YES/NO, sizes position
