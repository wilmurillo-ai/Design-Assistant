# 0G Compute Network

Interface with the 0G Compute Network — a decentralized AI inference marketplace with TEE-verified model integrity.

## Prerequisites

- `0g-compute-cli` installed: `npm i -g @0glabs/0g-serving-broker`
  - Note: npm package name is `@0glabs/0g-serving-broker` (the old `@0glabs/0g-compute-cli` package name no longer resolves), but the binary command is still `0g-compute-cli`.
- Wallet funded with 0G tokens
- Logged in: avoid passing key on the command line when possible (it can be visible in shell history/process list). Prefer reading from a protected prompt/env:
  - `read -s OG_PK; 0g-compute-cli login --private-key "$OG_PK"; unset OG_PK`
- Network configured: `0g-compute-cli setup-network`

## Core Workflows

### 1. Discover Models

```bash
# List all providers with models, prices, verifiability
0g-compute-cli inference list-providers

# Detailed view with health/uptime metrics
0g-compute-cli inference list-providers-detail

# Include providers without valid TEE signer
0g-compute-cli inference list-providers --include-invalid
```

Filter output by model name, price, health status, and TeeML support (models running in Trusted Execution Environment).

### 2. Verify Provider Integrity

**Always verify before trusting a new provider.** TEE verification ensures the model runs in a secure enclave with hardware-attested integrity.

```bash
# Full TEE attestation check
0g-compute-cli inference verify --provider <address>

# Download raw attestation data
0g-compute-cli inference download-report --provider <address> --output report.json
```

The verify command checks:
- TEE signer address matches contract
- Docker Compose hash integrity
- DStack TEE (Intel TDX) attestation

### 3. Wallet & Balance

```bash
# Account overview
0g-compute-cli get-account

# Per-provider sub-account balance
0g-compute-cli get-sub-account --provider <address> --service inference

# Fund operations
0g-compute-cli deposit --amount <0G>                          # To main account
0g-compute-cli transfer-fund --provider <addr> --amount <0G> --service inference  # To sub-account
0g-compute-cli retrieve-fund --service inference              # From sub-accounts
0g-compute-cli refund --amount <0G>                           # Withdraw to wallet
```

**Important**: Inference calls fail if sub-account balance is depleted. Monitor balances regularly.

### 4. Configure OpenClaw Provider

Get API key from a verified provider (interactive — prompts for expiration):
```bash
0g-compute-cli inference get-secret --provider <address>
```

Add to `openclaw.json`:
```json
"providers": {
  "0g-<model-name>": {
    "baseUrl": "<provider-url>/v1/proxy",
    "apiKey": "<secret>",
    "api": "openai-completions",
    "models": [{ "id": "<model-id>", "name": "<display-name>" }]
  }
}
```

Register in `agents.defaults.models` with an alias. Set `cost: 0` since billing is on-chain.

**See [references/openclaw-config.md](references/openclaw-config.md) for complete setup guide.**

### 5. Price Comparison (0G vs OpenRouter)

Compare 0G pricing against OpenRouter for the same models:

```bash
scripts/0g-price-compare.sh
```

No API keys needed — uses public endpoints:
- CoinGecko for 0G token → USD price
- OpenRouter `/api/v1/models` for model pricing
- 0G CLI for provider pricing

Shows side-by-side USD/1M tokens with savings percentage. Set `OG_TOKEN_PRICE_USD` env var to override CoinGecko price.

### 6. Status Check

```bash
# Login status & wallet
0g-compute-cli status

# Current network (mainnet/testnet)
0g-compute-cli show-network
```

## Safety Guidelines

- Always run `inference verify` on new providers before use
- Check provider health/uptime before relying on them
- Monitor sub-account balances — depleted funds cause inference failures
- Private key stored in `~/.0g-compute-cli/config.json` — never expose this file
