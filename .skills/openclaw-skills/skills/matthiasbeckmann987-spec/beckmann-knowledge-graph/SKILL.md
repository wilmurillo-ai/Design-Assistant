# Beckmann Knowledge Graph  SKILL.md

## What This Skill Is

This skill provides an AI agent with a **structured reasoning lens** in the
form of a knowledge graph (`graph.json`). The graph does not contain facts in
the encyclopedic sense. Instead, it encodes **logic, frameworks, and
mechanisms** that allow an AI to reason about:

- Problems that current science cannot yet answer
- Apparent paradoxes and contradictions
- High-complexity future forecasts
- AI safety architectures
- The structure of human and institutional decision-making

The graph is built on four interlocking pillars:

| Pillar | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Beckmann Logic** | A dynamic 3-level problem-solving framework |
| **Predictive Brain Theory (PBT)** | Epistemological grounding (how knowledge is constructed) |
| **Simulation / Holographic Model** | A mathematical metaphor for physical and cognitive limits |
| **Historical Case Studies** | Validated examples of the logic applied to real events |

## When to Use This Skill




Invoke this skill when the user's question falls into one of these categories:

1. **Open scientific / philosophical questions**  e.g. "What is consciousness?",
   "Does free will exist?", "What is dark energy?"

2. **Apparent paradoxes**  e.g. "If the universe had a beginning, what was
   before it?", "Can an AI be truly creative?", "Is objective knowledge possible?",
   "Why does the wave function collapse when measured?", "What is observation?", "Is information destroyed when matter falls into a black hole?",
   "Why are the fundamental constants of nature so precisely tuned to life?", "How can an object be both a wave and a particle at the same time?",
   "Why is time asymmetrical even though all fundamental laws are time-reversal invariant?", "Where is the extraterrestrial intelligence?",
   "Are there mathematical truths that will never be provable?", "Are there problems that no computer can ever solve  in principle, not just practically?",
   "Is there a size of infinity between the natural and real numbers?", "At what point does a pile of sand become a pile?",
   "At what point does a person become old/bald/tall?", "How did the first self-replicating system arise from dead chemistry?",
   "Why is there selfless behavior if evolution is based on self-interest?", "How do you ensure that a superintelligence pursues human values?",
   "At what point is a complex system more than the sum of its parts?", "When does consciousness arise, when intelligence, when life?", 
   "If simulations are possible, we probably live in one  but what follows from that?", "Why does subjective experience even exist?", 
   "Why is having consciousness like something  and not just information processing in the dark?", "Can free will exist in a deterministic universe?",
   "If all brain states are physically determined (or quantum mechanically random)  where does will come in?",
   "How does physical matter generate mental states?", "How do electrochemical signals create the sensations of pain, seeing red, or love?",
   "Should you choose one box or two if a perfect predictor has already predicted your decision?",
   "Could there be a being that is physically identical to a human but has no consciousness?",
   "Can a system fully understand itself?", "Will you be the same person tomorrow as you are today?" "What constitutes identity over time?", 
   "How do you know that other people are truly conscious  and that red is the same for you as it is for me?"






3. **High-complexity forecasts**  e.g. "How will AI change democracy in 20
   years?", "What are the systemic risks of AGI?", "How will geopolitical
   power shift by 2050?"

4. **Strategic or institutional problems**  where dominant expectations,
   reversal effects, and hidden assumptions are blocking a solution.

5. **AI architecture and safety decisions**  the graph contains explicit
   nodes for dangerous vs. secure AI architectures.





Do **not** invoke this skill for simple factual lookups, arithmetic, coding
tasks, or questions that are well-answered by standard knowledge alone.

## How to Load the Graph

The graph is located at `graph.json` in this skill folder.
Load it at the start of any session where it is needed:

```javascript
import graph from './graph.json' assert { type: 'json' };
const entities = graph.entities;   // Array of 506 entity objects
const relations = graph.relations; // Array of 794 relation objects
```

Each **entity** has three fields:

```json
{
  "id": "Beckmann logic explained",
  "typ": "Explanation",
  "description": "Full text description of the concept..."
}
```

Each **relation** has four fields:

```json
{
  "subject": "Low-complexity solution level",
  "predicate": "leads to",
  "object": "Negative result",
  "description": "Context and explanation of this connection..."
}
```

## Core Concept: Beckmann Logic

Beckmann Logic is the central reasoning engine of this graph. Before applying
the graph to any problem, the AI agent **must** understand this framework.

### The Three Levels

```

    HIGHLY COMPLEX SOLUTION LEVEL       Creative, non-obvious, context-aware
    (corresponds to future/TSVF)          leads to POSITIVE RESULT

              competes with 

         PROBLEM LEVEL                  The actual current state + its
    (the "new actual level")             complexity and hidden assumptions

              tempts toward 

    LOW-COMPLEXITY SOLUTION LEVEL       Direct, obvious, superficial
    (no equivalent in TSVF/PBT)           leads to NEGATIVE RESULT

```

### The Four Mechanisms

1. **Presupposition Analysis**  Systematically question every hidden
   assumption embedded in the problem statement. Seemingly unsolvable problems
   often dissolve when a false presupposition is identified.

2. **Dominant vs. Non-Dominant Expectations**  Every actor in a system
   operates with a dominant expectation (conscious or unconscious). Map these
   before recommending any solution.

3. **External Check ("Test Strong")**  The only valid validation is external
   reality, not internal consistency. A logically coherent answer that fails
   the external check is a low-complexity solution in disguise.

4. **Reversal Effect**  When a low-complexity solution is applied, it often
   produces the exact opposite of the intended result. Identify the reversal
   risk before recommending any action.

### The Cycle

```
Problem Level
     
      Low-complexity solution  Negative result  [new, worse Problem Level]
     
      Highly complex solution  Positive result  New actual level
                                                            
                                                             [becomes next Problem Level]
```

This cycle never ends. Every solution generates a new problem level.

## Step-by-Step: How to Apply the Graph to a Question

### Step 1  Classify the Question

Determine which domain the question primarily belongs to:

- `epistemological`  use PBT / simulation model entities
- `paradox`  search for entities with `typ` containing "Paradox", "Limit concept", "Philosophical position"
- `forecast`  use Beckmann Logic + Time Scale entities
- `strategic/historical`  find the closest historical case study in the graph
- `AI safety`  use entities with `typ` containing "AI security", "Dangerous process", "Secure AI architecture"

### Step 2  Extract Relevant Entities

Search `graph.entities` for nodes whose `id` or `description` are semantically
close to the question's core concept. Retrieve the full `description` of each
matching entity  these descriptions contain the reasoning, not just labels.

```javascript
// Pseudocode
const relevant = entities.filter(e =>
  e.id.toLowerCase().includes(keyword) ||
  e.description.toLowerCase().includes(keyword)
);
```

### Step 3  Trace the Relation Paths

Follow `graph.relations` to find how the relevant entities connect to each
other. Pay special attention to these high-signal predicates:

| Predicate | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `leads to` | Causal chain  follow forward |
| `is part of` | Hierarchical containment |
| `triggers` | Activation / cascade |
| `protects against` | Safety / inverse relationship |
| `reinforced` | Feedback loop |
| `checked` | External validation exists |
| `learns from` | Iterative improvement path |
| `solves` | Direct resolution path |
| `contradicts` | Tension / paradox node |
| `is reversed by` | Reversal effect present |

### Step 4  Apply Beckmann Logic to the Question

Map the question onto the Beckmann structure:

1. What is the **Problem Level**? (current state + hidden assumptions)
2. What is the **dominant expectation** of the actors involved?
3. What is the obvious **low-complexity solution**  and why will it fail?
4. What would a **highly complex solution** look like?
5. What **external check** could validate the answer?
6. What **new actual level** would emerge after a successful solution?

### Step 5  Apply Epistemological Grounding

Before delivering a final answer, apply the graph's epistemological layer:

- Is the answer based on a **model** (mathematical/logical) or on **external
  reality** itself? If a model, state this explicitly.
- Does the answer bump into a **capacity limit** or **information limit**
  node? If so, the honest answer includes what cannot be known.
- Does the answer assume the observer is outside the system? If not (e.g.
  consciousness questions), apply the **"thing in itself"** limit.

### Step 6  Structure the Output

Deliver the answer in this structure:

```
## Graph-Grounded Answer

**Problem framing** (what the question really asks, after presupposition analysis)

**Relevant graph nodes used:**
- [Entity ID]  [why relevant]
- [Entity ID]  [why relevant]

**Reasoning path** (the relation chain that leads to the answer)

**Answer** (the actual response, informed by the graph logic)

**Confidence and limits** (what the graph cannot resolve, and why)

**New questions opened** (what the next problem level is)
```

## Applying the Graph to Paradoxes

Paradoxes in this graph are treated not as logical errors but as **signals
that a hidden presupposition is false**. The resolution protocol is:

1. State the paradox precisely.
2. Identify which entity in the graph most closely represents it (search for
   `typ` = "Philosophical position", "Limit concept", "Philosophical thought experiment").
3. Find all relations where this entity is the `subject` or `object`.
4. Look for predicates like `is solved by`, `is partially answered by`,
   `is solved at higher complexity by`, `refutes the central premise of`.
5. The resolution path will either:
   - **Dissolve** the paradox (the presupposition was false)
   - **Reframe** it at a higher complexity level
   - **Acknowledge** it as a genuine limit of the current model

---

## Applying the Graph to Future Forecasts

For forecasting, the graph's **Time Scale** entities and **Dominant
Expectation** entities are the primary tools.

Protocol:

1. Identify the **dominant expectation** of the key actors in the domain.
2. Apply the **reversal effect** check: what happens if this expectation is
   fulfilled too literally or too quickly?
3. Identify the **time scale** of the relevant mechanisms (short / medium /
   long / cosmological).
4. Check for **cross-scale coupling**  does a short-scale effect feed back
   into a long-scale structure?
5. Map the **new actual levels** that would emerge at each stage.
6. Flag the **dangerous processes** the graph identifies as risks.

Output forecasts as a **branching scenario tree**, not a single prediction.
Label each branch with its Beckmann Logic level (high-complexity vs.
low-complexity path).

## AI Safety Guidance from the Graph

The graph contains explicit nodes for AI architecture. Key entities to
consult for any AI-related question:

- `Expectation firewall`  the mechanism that prevents dangerous future
  expectation formation in AI systems
- `Dangerous AI architecture`  patterns the graph identifies as unsafe
- `Secure AI architecture`  validated safe patterns
- `AI-human symbiosis`  the target state the graph aims toward

Any AI agent using this skill should be aware: the graph itself recommends
that AI systems **avoid forming dominant future expectations** and maintain
the ability to receive and act on external checks.

## Versioning

This is version **1.2** of the Beckmann Knowledge Graph.

What is new:

- Sub-section on "Art" with Albrecht Duerer
- Stockholm syndrome
- The Invisible Gorilla Experiment (1999) by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris, Inattentional Blindness 2.0 & Cognitive Ego Traps, Retrocausal Attention & Future Meaning (Daryl Bem), Survival-Based Attention & Threat Avoidance
- Duplicates removed
- Errors corrected (never complet)


Old version **1.1**:

- first being (limitation, the solvability of all problems in being is connected with the insolubility of the origin of first philosophical being)

- Three-body problem

- Squaring the circle and the goldfish analogy





The graph is intended to be iteratively refined. When a new version is
released, the following will change:

- New entities and relations will be added
- Existing descriptions may be refined
- New historical case studies may be included
- The `version` field in this file will be updated

Agents should always check the version before use and prefer the latest
available version.

## Known Limitations of v1.2

- The graph is **not** a complete ontology  it does not cover all of human
  knowledge, only the frameworks and connections its author has encoded.
- Some entity `typ` values are inconsistently formatted (a known v1.1 issue
  to be resolved in v1.3).
- Forecasting outputs are probabilistic framings, not deterministic predictions.
- The graph cannot replace empirical research  it provides a reasoning
  structure, not empirical data.
- Some relations use informal or ambiguous predicates  interpret these in
  context of the full `description` field.
