   - Use high-quality images for better matching
   - Ensure images are publicly accessible
   - Consider resolution settings based on quality needs

4. **Document Processing**
   - Focus on key insights, not full text
   - Use document headings as slide titles
   - Ask user which sections to emphasize

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

```
Error: API key not found
Solution: Set SLIDES_2SLIDES_API_KEY environment variable
```

**To get your API key:**
- Go to [2slides.com/api](https://2slides.com/api)
- Log in to your account
- Navigate to API Keys section
- Generate a new key if needed

### Rate Limiting

```
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
Solution: Wait before retrying or check your plan limits
```

**To check your usage and limits:**
- Visit [2slides.com/api](https://2slides.com/api)
- Check your current plan and credit balance
- Review API rate limits for your tier
- Consider upgrading your plan at [2slides.com](https://2slides.com)

### Invalid Content

```
Error: 400 Bad Request
Solution: Verify content format and required parameters (theme-id or reference-image)
```

**For API support:**
- Visit [2slides.com/api](https://2slides.com/api) for API documentation
- Check the API reference for correct parameter formats
- Contact 2slides support through [2slides.com](https://2slides.com)

## Advanced Configuration

### Async vs Sync Mode

**Sync Mode (default):**
- Waits for generation (30-60 seconds)
- Returns results immediately
- Best for interactive use

**Async Mode:**
- Returns job ID immediately
- Poll for results with `get_job_status.py`
- Best for batch processing or large presentations

### Custom Settings

You can customize generation with additional parameters:

```bash
--aspect-ratio "16:9"          # Slide dimensions
--resolution "2K"              # Output quality (1K, 2K, 4K)
--page 10                      # Number of slides
--content-detail "concise"     # Brief or detailed content
```

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for complete parameter documentation.
