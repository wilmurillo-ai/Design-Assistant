This is the core PANews reading skill for users who want to follow cryptocurrency and blockchain news through PANews coverage. Use it for market-moving headlines, project and token updates, rankings, deep dives, topics, columns, series, events, and editorial picks.

It is best suited for structured news discovery and explanation. The skill should help users understand what is happening, why it matters, and where to keep reading, while staying accessible to readers who may not be technical.

## Common User Phrases

## General principles

- Do not predict price movements or give investment advice
- Content strictly from PANews - do not add information PANews has not reported
- For publishing content, use the panews-creator skill

## Execution guidance

- Use judgment for open-ended discovery tasks such as briefings, topic research, and trend summaries. Multiple valid paths are acceptable if the result stays grounded in PANews coverage.
- Be more specific for fragile tasks:
  - If the user provides an article URL or ID, resolve the article directly instead of broadening into generic search.
  - If the task is rankings, events, calendar items, or platform picks, use the most direct matching workflow instead of combining unrelated workflows first.
  - If PANews coverage is weak or missing, say so directly rather than filling gaps with outside knowledge.

## Language

All CLI commands support `--lang`, accepting standard locale strings (e.g. `zh`, `en`, `zh-TW`, `en-US`, `ja-JP`), automatically mapped to the nearest supported language. If omitted, the system locale is auto-detected. Match `--lang` to the user's question language.
