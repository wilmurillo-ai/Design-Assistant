# VideoDB Screen Recording Skill for OpenClaw

On-demand screen recording capabilities for OpenClaw agents. Record your screen and generate playable stream URLs when needed.

## Prerequisites

- OpenClaw installed and running
- VideoDB API key (get one at [console.videodb.io](https://console.videodb.io))
- Node.js 18+

## Installation

### 1. Copy Skill to OpenClaw

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
cp -r ./* ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring/
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
npm install
```

### 2. Set API Key

```bash
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_API_KEY 'sk-xxx'
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.enabled true
```

### 3. Restart Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
openclaw skills list
```

You should see `videodb-monitoring` in the list.

## How It Works

The skill is **on-demand** — the agent will use it when:
- You ask for a screen recording
- You want to search past activity
- You need transcripts of audio

The agent will:
1. Check if the API key is configured (ask you for it if not)
2. Start the monitor if not running
3. Start indexing only when needed for search, summaries, or transcripts
4. Stop indexing when it is no longer needed to reduce cost
5. Capture timestamps and generate stream URLs, optionally with player title/description metadata
6. Include recording URLs in responses when requested

### Example Requests

- "Do X on the browser and send me the recording"
- "What did I do in the last hour?"
- "Find when I opened the spreadsheet"
- "What was said in that meeting?"

## Manual Monitor Control

The monitor can also be started manually:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring

# Foreground (for testing)
npx tsx monitor.ts

# Background (for production)
nohup npx tsx monitor.ts > ~/.videodb/logs/monitor.log 2>&1 &
disown
```

Check status:
```bash
openclaw config get skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_IS_RUNNING
openclaw config get skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_CAPTURE_SESSION_ID
```

## Generate Stream URLs

Basic stream generation:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
npx tsx videodb.ts stream 1709740800 1709740830
```

With player metadata:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
npx tsx videodb.ts stream 1709740800 1709740830 --title "Checkout flow" --description "OpenClaw browser run"
```

When metadata is provided, the skill also prints the player share page URL when available.

## Indexing Control

The monitor now only records. Indexing is controlled explicitly through `videodb.ts` so you only pay for it when needed.

Start all indexing:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
npx tsx videodb.ts start-indexing
```

Stop all indexing:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
npx tsx videodb.ts stop-indexing
```

Granular commands:
```bash
npx tsx videodb.ts start-visual-index
npx tsx videodb.ts stop-visual-index
npx tsx videodb.ts start-transcript
npx tsx videodb.ts stop-transcript
npx tsx videodb.ts start-audio-index
npx tsx videodb.ts stop-audio-index
```

## Logs

All logs are stored in `~/.videodb/logs/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `monitor.log` | Screen capture monitor |
| `skill.log` | Skill command execution |

View logs:
```bash
tail -f ~/.videodb/logs/monitor.log
tail -f ~/.videodb/logs/skill.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not found"

Set your API key:
```bash
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_API_KEY 'sk-xxx'
```

### "No capture session"

Start the monitor:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
nohup npx tsx monitor.ts > ~/.videodb/logs/monitor.log 2>&1 &
disown
```

### "Another recorder instance is already running"

The monitor now performs a pre-cleanup on startup and will try to stop the previous monitor PID plus any lingering recorder helper processes automatically.

If you still need to clean up manually:
```bash
pkill -9 -f videodb_recorder
pkill -9 -f "monitor.ts"
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_IS_RUNNING 'false'
```

Then restart the monitor.

### "Permission denied" for microphone

The monitor will continue without audio. Screen recording still works.

### "No visual index found" or "No transcripts"

Start indexing when you need it:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/videodb-monitoring
npx tsx videodb.ts start-indexing
```

Run your search/summary/transcript command, then stop indexing afterwards:
```bash
npx tsx videodb.ts stop-indexing
```

### Stale state after crash

Reset state manually:
```bash
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_IS_RUNNING 'false'
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_CAPTURE_SESSION_ID ''
openclaw config set skills.entries.videodb-monitoring.env.VIDEODB_MONITOR_PID ''
```
