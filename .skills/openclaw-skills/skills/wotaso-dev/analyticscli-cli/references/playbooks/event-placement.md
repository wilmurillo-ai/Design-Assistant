# Event Placement Playbook

## Goal

Track only high-leverage product moments so analytics stays actionable and stable.

## Credential Source

- Get `readonly_token` (CLI) and publishable ingest API key (SDK) in project **API Keys** at [dash.analyticscli.com](https://dash.analyticscli.com).
- Optional: get `project_id` from project context for explicit `--project` overrides.
- Preferred: set the CLI default project once with `analyticscli projects select` (arrow-key picker).

## Must-Track Moments

- `onboarding:start`
- `onboarding:complete`
- `activation:first_value`
- `paywall:shown`
- `purchase:success`
- `review_prompt:shown`

## Dedicated Events: Onboarding to Paywall to Subscription

- `onboarding:start`
- `onboarding:step_view`
- `onboarding:step_complete` (optional; only for steps with explicit completion semantics)
- `onboarding:complete`
- `onboarding:skip`
- `paywall:shown`
- `paywall:skip`
- `purchase:started`
- `purchase:success`
- `purchase:failed`
- `purchase:cancel`

## Placement Rules

- Track at intent boundaries, not every UI tap.
- Emit one event per semantic action.
- Use `onboarding:step_view` as the default step signal; add `onboarding:step_complete` only when there is a true completion boundary.
- For survey steps, `onboarding:step_view` + `onboarding:survey_response` is usually enough.
- Use stable names and avoid silent renames.
- Attach compact, query-relevant properties only.
- Avoid direct PII fields.

## Required Properties For Funnel Stability

- `fromScreen`
- `platform`
- `runtimeEnv` (auto-attached by SDK)
- `isNewUser`
- `onboardingFlowId`
- `onboardingFlowVersion`

Step-level properties:

- `stepKey`
- `stepIndex`
- `stepCount`

Paywall and purchase properties:

- `paywallId`
- `experimentVariant`
- `plan`
- `productId`
- `currency`

`appVersion` recommendation:
- Prefer setting `appVersion` once in SDK init/tracker defaults.
- Do not require repeating `appVersion` in every event payload.

## Dashboard Rules For Dedicated Bar Chart

- Denominator: distinct users with `isNewUser=true` who triggered `onboarding:start`
- Numerator per bar: distinct users from the same cohort who triggered the target event
- Always segment by `onboardingFlowId`
- Do not mix flows with different `stepCount` in one linear step chart

## Validation Loop

```bash
analyticscli schema events --limit 200
analyticscli goal-completion --start onboarding:start --complete onboarding:complete --last 30d
analyticscli goal-completion --start onboarding:start --complete purchase:success --last 30d
analyticscli goal-completion --start paywall:shown --complete paywall:skip --last 30d
```
