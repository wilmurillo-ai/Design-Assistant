# vvvv gamma Fundamentals

## What Is vvvv gamma

vvvv gamma is a visual programming environment for .NET 8. It combines node-based patching with C# code generation, targeting Stride (3D engine) and .NET APIs. Programs are built by connecting nodes with links in a visual editor.

vvvv is a live programming environment — programs run continuously while you build them. Both visual patch edits and C# code changes take effect immediately without restarting. vvvv compiles C# source files itself via Roslyn into in-memory assemblies on every save.

## Document Structure

- **`.vl` files** — vvvv gamma documents (XML-based, version controlled)
- Each document contains **Patches** (visual programs) and **Definitions** (types, operations)
- Documents can reference NuGet packages and other `.vl` files
- The **Patch Explorer** shows the document's type hierarchy

## Execution Model

- **Frame-based evaluation** — the mainloop evaluates the entire graph every frame (~60 FPS)
- **Data flows left-to-right, top-to-bottom** through links between nodes
- **Process nodes** maintain state between frames (constructor → Update loop → Dispose)
- **Operation nodes** are pure functions evaluated each frame
- vvvv evaluates all connected nodes, skips disconnected subgraphs

## Live Compilation Model

vvvv runs your program continuously while you edit it. There is no edit-compile-run cycle for patches and shaders. For C#, live reload depends on how the code is referenced.

### Patch Changes

- Edits to visual patches apply immediately
- Node state (instance fields) is preserved across edits
- New nodes and links become active on the next frame

### Shader Changes

- `.sdsl` shader files always live-reload when saved
- vvvv recompiles shaders in the background and swaps them in the running program

### C# — Two Workflows

C# code can be integrated via source project reference or pre-compiled binary. The choice depends on project size and development phase.

**Source project reference** (live reload):

When a .vl document references a .csproj source project, vvvv compiles .cs files itself via Roslyn into in-memory assemblies. No `dotnet build` or external toolchain is involved.

- On .cs file save, vvvv detects the change and recompiles in the background
- Status indicator: gray = building symbols, orange = emitting C#
- On successful compilation, affected nodes restart their lifecycle:
  1. `Dispose()` called on old instance
  2. New constructor runs (with fresh `NodeContext`)
  3. `Update()` resumes on the next frame
- Static fields reset on reload — the entire in-memory assembly is replaced
- On compilation error, the program continues running with the last valid code

**Binary reference** (no live reload):

When a .vl document references a pre-compiled DLL or NuGet package, the assembly is loaded once at startup. To pick up changes, you must rebuild the DLL externally (e.g., `dotnet build`) and restart vvvv. This workflow is common for larger projects and stable libraries where live reload is not needed.

## Node Categories

### Process Nodes
- Have Create (constructor), Update (per-frame), and Dispose lifecycle
- Written in C# with `[ProcessNode]` attribute
- Maintain internal state between frames
- Use change detection to avoid redundant work

### Operation Nodes
- Pure functions: same input always produces same output
- Written as static C# methods (auto-discovered by vvvv)
- No state between frames
- No `[ProcessNode]` attribute needed

### Adaptive Nodes
- Nodes that adapt their implementation based on connected input types
- Example: `+` works with int, float, Vector3, string, etc.
- Resolved at link-time, not runtime

## Pins, Pads, and Links

- **Pins** — inputs and outputs on nodes and regions
- **Pads** — visual nodes for reading/writing Properties inside operation patches; all pads with the same name refer to the same property
- **Links** — connections between pins that define data flow and execution order
- **Spreading** — when a `Spread<T>` connects to a single-value input, the node auto-iterates

## When to Patch vs Write C#

| Use Patching | Use C# Code |
|---|---|
| Prototyping, data flow | Custom nodes, performance-critical code |
| Visual connections, UI composition | Complex algorithms |
| Real-time parameter tweaking | .NET library interop |
| Dataflow routing and spreading | Native/unmanaged resource management |

## Channels — Reactive Data Flow

- `IChannel<T>` — observable value container
- `IChannel<T>.Value` — read/write the current value
- `Channel.IsValid()` — check if connected
- Channels persist state across sessions
- Enable two-way data binding between UI and patch

For C# channel integration patterns (IChannelHub, PublicChannelHelper, [CanBePublished]), see vvvv-channels.

## Key Data Types

| Type | C# Equivalent | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `Spread<T>` | `ImmutableArray<T>` | vvvv's immutable collection |
| `SpreadBuilder<T>` | `ImmutableArray<T>.Builder` | Build spreads efficiently |
| Float32, Int32, etc. | `float`, `int` | Primitives |
| `Vector2/3/4` | `Stride.Core.Mathematics` | Spatial math |
| `Color4` | `Stride.Core.Mathematics` | RGBA color |

## File Types

| Extension | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.vl` | vvvv gamma documents (XML-based) |
| `.sdsl` | Stride shader files (SDSL language) |
| `.cs` | C# source files for custom nodes |
| `.csproj` | .NET project files |
| `.nuspec` | NuGet package spec |

## Ecosystem Overview

vvvv's functionality extends through NuGet packages that bundle .vl documents, C# nodes, and shaders.

| Domain | Key Packages |
|---|---|
| 3D Rendering | VL.Stride (Stride engine), VL.Fuse (GPU visual programming) |
| 2D Rendering | VL.Skia, ImGui, Avalonia, CEF/HTML |
| Hardware I/O | DMX/Art-Net, ILDA lasers, depth cameras (Azure Kinect, ZED), robotics (KUKA, Spot), Ultraleap, LiDAR |
| Networking | OSC, MIDI, MQTT, Redis, WebSocket, HTTP, TCP/UDP, ZeroMQ, Modbus, Ableton Link |
| Computer Vision | OpenCV, MediaPipe, YOLO (v8–v11), ONNX Runtime |
| Audio | NAudio, VST hosting, SuperCollider bridge |
| General .NET | Any of 100,000+ standard NuGet packages via .csproj reference |

To add a package: reference it in your `.vl` document's Dependencies, or add a `<PackageReference>` to your `.csproj`. See vvvv-dotnet for .csproj details.

## AppHost & Runtime Detection

```csharp
// Detect if running as exported .exe vs editor
bool isExported = nodeContext.AppHost.IsExported;

// Register per-app singleton services
nodeContext.AppHost.Services.RegisterService(myService);
```
