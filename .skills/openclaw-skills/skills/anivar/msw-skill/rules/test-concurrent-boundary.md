# Use `server.boundary()` for Concurrent Test Isolation

## Problem

`it.concurrent` runs tests in parallel. Without `server.boundary()`, `server.use()` in one concurrent test affects all other concurrent tests.

## Incorrect

```typescript
// BUG: concurrent tests share the same server — overrides leak
it.concurrent('shows admin view', async () => {
  server.use(
    http.get('/api/user', () => HttpResponse.json({ role: 'admin' }))
  )
  // Another concurrent test may see this override!
})

it.concurrent('shows member view', async () => {
  server.use(
    http.get('/api/user', () => HttpResponse.json({ role: 'member' }))
  )
  // May actually get 'admin' from the other test's override
})
```

## Correct

```typescript
it.concurrent('shows admin view', server.boundary(async () => {
  server.use(
    http.get('/api/user', () => HttpResponse.json({ role: 'admin' }))
  )
  // Override is scoped to this boundary — invisible to other tests
}))

it.concurrent('shows member view', server.boundary(async () => {
  server.use(
    http.get('/api/user', () => HttpResponse.json({ role: 'member' }))
  )
  // Gets 'member' as expected — boundary prevents leakage
}))
```

## Why

`server.boundary()` creates an isolated handler scope. Any handlers added via `server.use()` inside the boundary are only visible to requests originating from that boundary's execution context. This is essential for `it.concurrent` and any parallel test runner.
