# Squeeze Page Builder

Build email capture landing pages (squeeze pages) as self-contained HTML files with no dependencies. The page offers a high-value lead magnet (ebook, checklist, template, or cheat sheet) in exchange for the visitor's email address, then redirects to an affiliate offer on form submission. Output is a single deployable `.html` file.

## When to Use

- User wants to build an email list while simultaneously promoting an affiliate product
- User wants to warm up cold traffic before sending to an affiliate offer
- User says "squeeze page", "opt-in page", "lead magnet", "email capture", "freebie page"
- User wants a two-step funnel: email capture → affiliate redirect
- User has ad traffic and needs a landing page that collects leads before the affiliate click

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Lead Magnet and Offer

A squeeze page requires two things:
1. **The lead magnet** — the free thing offered in exchange for the email
2. **The thank-you redirect** — where the visitor goes after submitting (the affiliate link)

**Detect from user input. If not specified, ask:**
- "What free resource will you offer? (e.g., a checklist, ebook, template, cheat sheet, mini-course)"
- "What affiliate product should visitors see after they sign up?"

**Lead magnet selection guide** — suggest based on niche if user is unsure:
| Niche | Best lead magnet type |
|---|---|
| Marketing / SEO | Checklist, swipe file, templates |
| Finance / Investing | Calculator, cheat sheet, guide |
| Health / Fitness | Meal plan, workout plan, tracker |
| Software / SaaS | Tutorial, quick-start guide, resource list |
| Business / Productivity | Templates, SOPs, spreadsheets |

**Lead magnet title formula** (high-converting):
- "[N]-Point Checklist: How to [Achieve Desired Outcome]"
- "The Free [Niche] Starter Kit: [X] Templates for [Goal]"
- "Download: The Ultimate [Topic] Guide ([Year])"
- "[Adjective] Cheat Sheet: [X] Ways to [Outcome] in [Timeframe]"

### Step 2: Craft the Page Strategy

Read `references/conversion-principles.md` for squeeze page-specific principles.

Key conversion levers for squeeze pages:
1. **Clarity over cleverness** — the visitor should know in 3 seconds what they get and what they must do
2. **Above-fold completeness** — the opt-in form must be visible without scrolling on mobile
3. **Single goal** — no navigation, no external links, no distractions
4. **Social proof** — even one strong number ("Join 4,200+ marketers") dramatically lifts conversion
5. **Privacy signal** — "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime." reduces friction at the form

Plan the page sections:
1. **Header** — logo/brand name only (no nav links)
2. **Hero section** (above fold):
   - Headline: the transformation or outcome the lead magnet delivers
   - Sub-headline: what's inside + who it's for
   - Lead magnet visual (styled HTML mockup — no images needed)
   - Email form with single field + submit button
   - Privacy micro-copy: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
3. **What's Inside** — 3-5 bullet points describing lead magnet contents
4. **Social Proof** — subscriber count, testimonial, or press mention
5. **Who This Is For** — 3-4 bullet points identifying the ideal reader
6. **Second opt-in form** — repeat the form lower on the page for scrollers
7. **Footer** — FTC note, privacy policy placeholder, Affitor attribution

**Thank-you redirect behavior:**
The form submission should redirect to the affiliate URL. Since this is a static HTML file with no backend, use a JavaScript pattern:
```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  // In production: POST email to your ESP (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.)
  // Then redirect to affiliate offer:
  window.location.href = '[affiliate_url]';
});
```
Include a comment block explaining how to wire this to a real ESP (Mailchimp embed code, ConvertKit, etc.).

### Step 3: Write the Full HTML

Build a complete, self-contained HTML file:

**Copy requirements:**

Headline (8-12 words, result-focused):
- "Get the Free [Lead Magnet Title] and Start [Outcome] Today"
- "Download: [Lead Magnet Title] — Free for [Audience]"
- "The [Adjective] Way to [Outcome]: Free [Format] Inside"

Sub-headline (15-25 words):
- "[N] [templates/steps/strategies] that [specific audience] use to [specific outcome] — completely free."

Button copy (action-oriented, not "Submit"):
- "Send Me the Free [Lead Magnet] →"
- "Get Instant Access →"
- "Download the Free [Format] Now →"

**HTML structure requirements:**
- Single `<style>` block — no external CSS
- Mobile-first responsive (375px base, 768px breakpoint)
- System font stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif`
- Color scheme from user input or default: primary `#2563eb`, accent warm tone
- Lead magnet mockup: a styled `<div>` that looks like a book/checklist cover — pure CSS, no images
- Form: single email input + submit button (no name field — lower friction)
- No navigation links that could take the visitor off the page
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` — squeeze pages shouldn't be indexed by Google

**JavaScript:**
- Form validation (email format check)
- Redirect to affiliate URL on submit
- Comment block with ESP integration instructions for Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Kit, and Beehiiv

**Required elements:**
- FTC disclosure in footer: "This page contains affiliate links. If you purchase through our links, we may earn a commission."
- Privacy micro-copy on form: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
- "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer — use exact HTML from `shared/references/affitor-branding.md`

### Step 4: Format Output

**Part 1: Page Summary**
```
---
SQUEEZE PAGE
---
Lead Magnet: [title of the free offer]
Affiliate Redirect: [product name] — [affiliate URL]
Headline: [the main headline used]
Button Copy: [CTA button text]
Color Scheme: [color applied]
ESP Integration: Instructions included in HTML comments
---
```

**Part 2: Complete HTML**
Full self-contained HTML in a fenced code block. Save as `[niche]-optin.html`.

**Part 3: Setup Instructions**
```
---
SETUP
---
1. Save as `[niche]-optin.html` — open in browser to preview
2. Wire the form to your ESP:
   - Mailchimp: Replace the JS redirect with your Mailchimp embed form action URL
   - ConvertKit/Kit: Use their API or embed form, keep the redirect in the success hook
   - Beehiiv: Use their embed form with a custom redirect
3. Replace affiliate URL: search for "[AFFILIATE_URL]" in the file — update with your tracking link
4. Deploy: Netlify Drop (drag to app.netlify.com/drop), GitHub Pages, or any static host
5. Drive traffic: Use social posts, paid ads, or bio link to send visitors to this page
---
```

## Input Schema

```yaml
lead_magnet:                # REQUIRED
  title: string             # e.g., "The 10-Point SEO Audit Checklist"
  type: string              # "checklist" | "ebook" | "template" | "cheat-sheet" | "mini-course" | "resource-list"
  description: string       # What's inside — used for bullet points

affiliate_product:          # REQUIRED — where to redirect after email capture
  name: string
  url: string               # Affiliate link — the thank-you redirect destination
  reward_value: string
  description: string       # Brief — used in footer context if needed

target_audience: string     # REQUIRED — who this page is for (e.g., "e-commerce store owners")

niche: string               # OPTIONAL — helps with copy tone and lead magnet visual styling
                            # e.g., "marketing", "finance", "fitness", "SaaS"

headline: string            # OPTIONAL — override auto-generated headline

color_scheme: string        # OPTIONAL — "blue" | "green" | "purple" | "orange" | "dark" | hex
                            # Default: "blue" (#2563eb)

social_proof: object        # OPTIONAL — subscriber count or testimonial
  type: string              # "count" | "testimonial"
  value: string             # "4,200+ subscribers" OR a short quote
  attribution: string       # If testimonial: "— Name, Job Title"

esp: string                 # OPTIONAL — which email service provider they use
                            # "mailchimp" | "convertkit" | "beehiiv" | "aweber" | "other"
                            # Default: "other" (generic instructions)
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] FTC disclosure in footer
- [ ] Privacy micro-copy near form: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
- [ ] `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` present
- [ ] Form has single email field only (no name field — lower friction)
- [ ] Form validates email format before submission
- [ ] Self-contained HTML: no external resources, no navigation links off-page

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
squeeze_page:
  lead_magnet_title: string
  headline: string
  button_copy: string
  affiliate_redirect: string    # The affiliate URL used in the redirect
  color_scheme: string
  html: string                  # Complete self-contained HTML
  filename: string              # e.g., "seo-checklist-optin.html"

funnel:
  step_1: string               # "Visitor sees squeeze page"
  step_2: string               # "Visitor submits email"
  step_3: string               # "Visitor redirected to [product] affiliate page"
  esp_note: string             # Note about wiring to an ESP

deploy:
  local: string
  netlify: string
  github_pages: string
```

## Output Format

Present as three sections:
1. **Page Summary** — lead magnet, redirect target, headline used
2. **HTML** — complete file in a code block, ready to save and deploy
3. **Setup Instructions** — how to wire ESP and deploy

The HTML should work as a preview without any backend — form submission redirects to affiliate URL directly in the demo state.

## Error Handling

- **No lead magnet specified**: Suggest 3 options based on the niche. Ask: "Which type of lead magnet would you like? Here are 3 ideas for [niche]: [A], [B], [C]."
- **No affiliate URL**: "What affiliate product should visitors see after they sign up? This is the thank-you redirect destination."
- **Audience too vague**: Use the niche to infer audience. If still unclear, use "online entrepreneurs and marketers" as the default.
- **No ESP specified**: Include generic ESP instructions in comments covering Mailchimp, ConvertKit, and Beehiiv.
- **User wants form to actually send emails**: Explain that static HTML cannot send emails directly. Provide instructions for using Netlify Forms or Formspree as a free no-backend option.

## Examples

**Example 1: SEO checklist**
User: "Build a squeeze page offering a free SEO checklist, send people to my Semrush affiliate link after"
Action: lead_magnet={title:"10-Point SEO Audit Checklist", type:"checklist"}, affiliate_redirect=Semrush URL, generate page with checklist mockup visual, blue theme.

**Example 2: Custom headline and color**
User: "Create an email capture page for a free email marketing template pack, purple color scheme, redirect to Klaviyo"
Action: lead_magnet="Email Marketing Template Pack", color_scheme=purple, affiliate_redirect=Klaviyo, generate page.

**Example 3: With social proof**
User: "Squeeze page for a free AI tools cheat sheet with 2000 subscribers social proof"
Action: lead_magnet="AI Tools Cheat Sheet", social_proof={type:"count", value:"2,000+ subscribers"}, generate page with subscriber count displayed prominently.

**Example 4: Chained from S1**
User: "Build a squeeze page to warm up leads before sending them to this offer"
Context: S1 returned HeyGen as recommended_program
Action: affiliate_product=HeyGen from S1, suggest 3 lead magnet ideas for the AI video niche, build squeeze page on selection.
