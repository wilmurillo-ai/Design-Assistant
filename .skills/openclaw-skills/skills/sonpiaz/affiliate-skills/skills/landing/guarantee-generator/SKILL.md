# Guarantee Generator

Create YOUR personal guarantee that sits on top of the product's built-in guarantee. Addresses the gap: "What if I buy through your link and it doesn't work for me?" Risk reversal is the most underleveraged conversion tool in affiliate marketing.

## Stage

S4: Landing — Guarantees are landing page copy. They directly impact conversion by removing the last barrier to clicking your affiliate link.

## When to Use

- User wants to increase conversion by reducing buyer perceived risk
- User asks "what guarantee can I offer as an affiliate?"
- User says "guarantee", "risk reversal", "risk-free", "money back"
- After running `grand-slam-offer` or `bonus-stack-builder` to complete the offer
- User has low conversion rates and needs to address trust/risk objections

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED
  name: string              # Product name
  pricing: string           # Product price
  has_free_trial: boolean   # Does the product offer a free trial?
  has_guarantee: string     # Product's existing guarantee (e.g., "30-day money back")

your_bonuses: string[]      # OPTIONAL — bonuses from bonus-stack-builder
                            # Default: none

your_capacity: string       # OPTIONAL — "low" | "medium" | "high"
                            # How much personal time you can invest
                            # Default: "medium"

audience_fears: string[]    # OPTIONAL — top objections/fears
                            # Default: inferred from product type
```

**Chaining from S4 bonus-stack-builder**: Use `bonus_stack.bonuses` to reference specific bonuses in guarantee.

**Chaining from S4 grand-slam-offer**: Use `value_equation` to target the weakest component with the guarantee.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Understand the product's existing guarantee/refund policy
2. Identify top 3 buyer fears for this product category
3. Assess user's capacity to deliver on guarantee promises

### Step 2: Design Guarantee Options

Read `shared/references/offer-frameworks.md` for guarantee types.

Create 3 guarantee options at different commitment levels:

**Option A: Light Touch** (low capacity)
- Scope: Your bonuses only
- Example: "If my bonuses don't help you get started faster, I'll refund their value"
- Risk to you: Minimal

**Option B: Support Guarantee** (medium capacity)
- Scope: Your time + bonuses
- Example: "If you're stuck after 30 days, I'll personally help you implement for 1 hour"
- Risk to you: Moderate (capped time)

**Option C: Results Guarantee** (high capacity)
- Scope: Specific outcome
- Example: "If you don't [specific measurable result] in [timeframe], I'll [specific action]"
- Risk to you: Higher (but highest conversion impact)

### Step 3: Write Guarantee Copy

For each option, produce:
1. **Guarantee headline** — bold, specific, confident
2. **Guarantee body** — exactly what you promise, the conditions, and the timeframe
3. **Claim process** — how they reach you if they want to use the guarantee
4. **Fine print** — fair conditions (must actually use the product, specific timeframe)

### Step 4: Recommend Best Fit

Based on `your_capacity` and product type, recommend one guarantee with reasoning.

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Guarantee is specific (not vague "satisfaction guaranteed")
- [ ] Guarantee is scoped to what YOU can deliver (not the product's features)
- [ ] Guarantee has a clear timeframe
- [ ] Claim process is simple and accessible
- [ ] Guarantee is realistic — you can actually fulfill it
- [ ] No guarantees about income or specific financial results (FTC)

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"

  product_name: string
  recommended_option: string     # "A" | "B" | "C"

      headline: string

      timeframe: string
      risk_to_you: string        # "minimal" | "moderate" | "higher"
      conversion_impact: string  # "moderate" | "high" | "very high"

  skill_slug: "guarantee-generator"
  stage: "landing"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to create a guarantee for. Tell me the product or run `affiliate-program-search` first."
- **User uncomfortable with guarantees**: Emphasize Option A — low risk, still impactful. "Even a light guarantee outperforms no guarantee."
- **Product has no refund policy**: Note this as a risk factor. Design guarantee around YOUR bonuses only (Option A).
- **User wants to guarantee income/results**: Flag FTC risk. Reframe to process guarantees: "I guarantee I'll help you implement" not "I guarantee you'll make $X".

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Create a guarantee for my HeyGen promotion"
→ Research HeyGen's refund policy, identify fears (is AI video quality good enough? will I look stupid?), create 3 options ranging from "bonus refund" to "I'll personally record your first video with you."

**Example 2:** "I don't have much time but want to offer a guarantee for Semrush"
→ your_capacity=low → Recommend Option A: "If my SEO audit template doesn't save you 3+ hours, email me and I'll personally audit one page for you." Low time commitment, high perceived value.

**Example 3:** "Design a results guarantee" (after grand-slam-offer + bonus-stack)
→ Use value equation weakness (e.g., time delay) as guarantee target: "If you haven't created your first campaign within 48 hours using my setup guide, I'll do it for you on a screenshare."

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `landing-page-creator` (S4) — guarantee copy for the guarantee section
- `email-drip-sequence` (S5) — guarantee as conversion lever in emails

### Fed By
- `grand-slam-offer` (S4) — value equation identifies what to guarantee
- `bonus-stack-builder` (S4) — specific bonuses to scope guarantee around

### Feedback Loop
- `conversion-tracker` (S6) measures if guarantee increases conversion rate → refine guarantee scope and messaging

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (guarantee makes saying yes feel safe)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.
