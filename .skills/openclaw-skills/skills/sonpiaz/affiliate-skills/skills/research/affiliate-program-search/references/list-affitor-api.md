list.affitor.com runs on Next.js + Supabase. Programs are stored in the `programs` table.

## Method 1: API v1 (preferred, requires API key)

Base URL: `https://list.affitor.com/api/v1`

Authentication: API key in header
```
Authorization: Bearer afl_xxxxx
```

API keys are created at list.affitor.com/settings (requires login). Keys need `programs:read` scope minimum.

### GET /api/v1/programs/:id

Returns a single program by UUID. Requires `programs:read` scope.

### GET /api/v1/skills/:slug/raw (PUBLIC, no auth)

Returns raw skill content as `text/plain`. This is the public install endpoint.

## Method 2: Web Fetch (fallback, no auth needed)

Use this if the user doesn't have an API key or if the API returns errors.

1. `web_search`: `site:list.affitor.com [user's category/keyword]`
2. `web_fetch`: the relevant list.affitor.com URL
3. Parse the page content to extract program data:
   - Program name
   - Reward value and type (look for patterns like "30% recurring")
   - Cookie days (look for "Xd" or "X day cookie")
   - Stars count (star icon + number)
   - Description text

Parsing notes:
- Programs are sorted by trending score (engagement / age) by default
- Each program card shows: name, reward info, cookie days, description, stars
- Programs and Skills are separate tabs/sections
- Program detail pages: `list.affitor.com/@[handle]/[slug]`

## Rate Limits

- Cache results within a conversation — don't re-fetch for the same query
- If fetching a full page, extract only relevant programs
- Prefer API when available (structured data, fewer tokens)
- API rate limit: 60 requests/minute per key
