# Monopoly Niche Finder

Find intersection niches where you're the ONLY voice. Based on Peter Thiel's "competition is for losers" — instead of fighting for market share in "AI tools" or "SaaS reviews," cross two domains to create a niche where you're the default authority. Example: "AI video tools for real estate agents" — specific enough to own, broad enough to monetize.

## Stage

S1: Research — Finding your monopoly niche IS research. This happens before you pick a program, before you write content. It's the strategic foundation that makes everything downstream easier.

## When to Use

- User is starting out and hasn't picked a niche yet
- User is in a crowded niche and struggling with competition
- User wants a unique angle for affiliate marketing
- User says "monopoly", "blue ocean", "unique niche", "no competition"
- User has expertise in two domains and wants to combine them
- Before running `affiliate-program-search` to narrow the search space

## Input Schema

```yaml
domain_1: string              # OPTIONAL — first area of expertise/interest
                              # e.g., "real estate", "fitness", "accounting"
                              # Default: ask user

domain_2: string              # OPTIONAL — second area to cross with
                              # e.g., "AI tools", "no-code", "automation"
                              # Default: suggest options

existing_audience: string     # OPTIONAL — who already follows/reads you
                              # e.g., "small business owners", "developers"
                              # Default: none

monetization_goal: string     # OPTIONAL — "affiliate" | "info-product" | "both"
                              # Default: "affiliate"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Domains

If domains not provided:
1. Ask user about their expertise, work experience, hobbies
2. Ask about their audience (if any)
3. Suggest 3-5 domain pairs based on their profile

If one domain provided, suggest 3-5 complementary domains to cross with.

### Step 2: Generate Intersection Niches

For each domain pair, generate 3-5 intersection niches:

Format: `[Domain 1] × [Domain 2] = [Intersection Niche]`

For each intersection:
1. **Specificity test**: Is this specific enough that you could be the #1 resource?
2. **Size test**: Is the audience large enough to monetize? (at least 10K potential monthly searches)
3. **Passion test**: Could you create 50+ pieces of content about this without burning out?
4. **Monetization test**: Are there affiliate programs in this space?

### Step 3: Validate with Data

For each top intersection niche:
1. `web_search` for `"[intersection niche]" site:reddit.com` — are people asking about this?
2. `web_search` for `"[intersection niche]" blog` — how many dedicated resources exist? (fewer = better)
3. `web_search` for `"[intersection niche]" affiliate program` — monetization potential
4. Check competitor landscape: if top 10 results are big brands → narrow further. If thin content → opportunity.

### Step 4: Score and Rank

Score each niche on:
| Factor | Weight | Scoring |
|---|---|---|
| Monopoly potential | 30% | 1-10: how few competitors |
| Monetization | 25% | 1-10: affiliate program quality |
| Audience size | 20% | 1-10: search volume + community size |
| Your fit | 15% | 1-10: expertise + passion |
| Content potential | 10% | 1-10: can you create 50+ pieces |

### Step 5: Deep Dive Top Niche

For the #1 scored niche:
1. Map 10-15 content topics you could cover
2. Identify 3-5 affiliate programs that fit
3. Describe the "ideal reader" persona
4. Suggest the first 3 pieces of content to create

### Step 6: Self-Validation

- [ ] Top niche has genuinely low competition (verified by search)
- [ ] Affiliate programs exist for this niche
- [ ] Content topics are specific (not generic)
- [ ] Niche is narrow enough to dominate but wide enough to sustain

```

## Error Handling

- **No domains provided**: "Tell me about your expertise, work, or interests — I'll help you find where two worlds collide into a monopoly niche."
- **Domains too similar**: "These are in the same space. Try crossing with something unexpected — the magic is in unlikely combinations."
- **No affiliate programs found**: Expand the niche slightly or suggest adjacent programs. "The niche is great for content, but let's find adjacent programs you can promote."
- **Niche too narrow**: "This might be too specific to sustain content. Let me widen the lens slightly..."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "I know real estate and I'm into AI tools"
→ Intersections: "AI tools for real estate agents", "AI property photography", "AI-powered real estate marketing", "Automated real estate content creation", "AI virtual staging tools". Validate each, score, deep-dive the winner.

**Example 2:** "I'm a developer struggling to stand out in the SaaS review space"
→ Cross "developer" with "SaaS": "Developer tools for non-technical founders", "DevOps tools for solo SaaS builders", "API-first marketing tools". Find the gap where dev expertise adds credibility.

**Example 3:** "Find me a niche with no competition"
→ Ask about domains/interests first, then generate intersections, validate with search data, prove low competition with evidence.
