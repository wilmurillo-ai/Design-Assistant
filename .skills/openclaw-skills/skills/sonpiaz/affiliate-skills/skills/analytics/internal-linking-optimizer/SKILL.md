# Internal Linking Optimizer

Analyze your site's internal link structure and generate an optimized hub-and-spoke linking plan. Finds orphan pages (no internal links pointing to them), identifies link equity bottlenecks, and creates specific linking instructions to maximize SEO impact.

## Stage

S6: Analytics & Optimization — This is analytics/audit work on existing content. Internal linking is the most underutilized SEO lever — it's 100% in your control and costs nothing.

## When to Use

- User wants to improve their site's SEO through better internal linking
- User asks about "orphan pages", "link structure", "hub and spoke"
- User says "internal linking", "link audit", "link equity"
- After publishing new content — new pages need internal links within 48 hours
- After `keyword-cluster-architect` — cluster structure defines the ideal link architecture
- Monthly maintenance task alongside `content-decay-detector`

## Input Schema

```yaml
site_url: string              # REQUIRED — site to analyze
                              # e.g., "myblog.com"

pages: object[]               # OPTIONAL — known pages with their topics
  - url: string
    title: string
    topic_cluster: string     # Which topical cluster it belongs to
    is_hub: boolean           # Is this a hub page?

hub_pages: string[]           # OPTIONAL — URLs of your hub/pillar pages
                              # Default: auto-detected

new_pages: string[]           # OPTIONAL — recently published pages needing links
                              # Default: none
```

**Chaining from S3 keyword-cluster-architect**: Use `keyword_clusters.hub` and `keyword_clusters.clusters` to define ideal link architecture.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Site Structure

1. `web_search`: `site:[site_url]` — discover indexed pages
2. Map pages to topic clusters (if not provided)
3. Identify current hub pages (pages that link to many others)
4. Note orphan pages (pages with few/no internal links pointing to them)

### Step 2: Analyze Current Link Structure

Read `shared/references/seo-strategy.md` for internal linking rules.

For each page group:
- Count internal links TO this page (inlinks)
- Count internal links FROM this page (outlinks)
- Check link depth from homepage (should be ≤ 3 clicks)
- Identify the anchor text used

### Step 3: Identify Issues

Flag:
1. **Orphan pages** — no or few internal links pointing to them
2. **Hub pages with weak linking** — hub should link to ALL spokes in its cluster
3. **Missing spoke-to-spoke links** — related spokes should link to each other
4. **Broken contextual flow** — pages that should link to each other but don't
5. **Over-linked pages** — too many outlinks dilute link equity
6. **Missing reverse links** — spoke links to hub but hub doesn't link back

### Step 4: Generate Linking Instructions

For each issue, provide specific instructions:

```
Page: [URL]
Action: Add internal link to [target URL]
Anchor text: "[suggested anchor]"
Location: [where in the content to add it]
Priority: [P0/P1/P2]
Reason: [why this link matters]
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Instructions are specific (exact URLs, anchor text, location)
- [ ] Hub-and-spoke architecture is logical
- [ ] Anchor text is natural and keyword-relevant
- [ ] No recommendations to over-link (max 3-5 internal links per 1000 words)
- [ ] New pages have at least 2-3 internal links pointing to them

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
internal_links:
  site: string
  pages_analyzed: number
  issues_found: number
  links_to_add: number

  orphan_pages: string[]        # Pages with zero/few inlinks
  hub_pages: string[]           # Identified hub pages

  link_actions:
    - source_url: string        # Page to add the link ON
      target_url: string        # Page to link TO
      anchor_text: string       # Suggested anchor text
      location: string          # Where in the content
      priority: string          # "P0" | "P1" | "P2"

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "internal-linking-optimizer"
  stage: "analytics"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "seo-audit"
    - "content-decay-detector"
    - "affiliate-blog-builder"
```

## Output Format

```
## Internal Link Audit: [Site]

### Structure Overview
- **Pages analyzed:** XX
- **Orphan pages:** XX (need links urgently)
- **Hub pages:** XX
- **Links to add:** XX
- **Average inlinks per page:** X.X

### Orphan Pages (P0 — fix immediately)
These pages have no/few internal links and are invisible to Google:
1. [URL] — [title] — 0 inlinks
2. [URL] — [title] — 1 inlink

### Link Actions

#### P0 — Critical
| Source Page | → | Target Page | Anchor Text | Location |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [source] | → | [target] | "[anchor]" | After paragraph about [topic] |

#### P1 — High
[same table]

#### P2 — Maintenance
[same table]

### Hub-and-Spoke Health
| Hub Page | Expected Spokes | Linked Spokes | Missing Links |
|---|---|---|---|
| [hub] | XX | XX | [list missing] |

### Quick Wins
1. [Easiest high-impact link to add]
2. [Second easiest]
3. [Third]
```

## Error Handling

- **No site URL**: "I need your site URL to analyze internal links."
- **Site not indexed**: "This site doesn't appear to be indexed. Check robots.txt and sitemap."
- **Too few pages**: "With only [X] pages, focus on creating more content first. Internal linking becomes powerful at 10+ pages."
- **No hub pages identifiable**: "I can't identify clear hub pages. Run `keyword-cluster-architect` first to define your topic structure."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Audit my blog's internal links"
→ Discover pages, map structure, find orphan pages, generate specific linking instructions with anchor text and placement.

**Example 2:** "I just published a new article, what should I link to it?"
→ Identify 3-5 existing pages that should link to the new article, with specific anchor text and paragraph locations.

**Example 3:** "Optimize internal links based on my keyword clusters" (after keyword-cluster-architect)
→ Use cluster structure to define ideal hub-spoke links. Compare current vs ideal. Generate gap-filling instructions.

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `content-decay-detector` (S3) — pages with weak link structure may be decaying
- `seo-audit` (S6) — link structure is a key SEO factor
- `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) — new articles need immediate internal links

### Fed By
- `keyword-cluster-architect` (S3) — cluster structure defines ideal link architecture
- `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) — new content that needs linking
- `seo-audit` (S6) — identifies pages with link structure issues

### Feedback Loop
- `seo-audit` (S6) tracks ranking changes after link optimization → measure impact of internal linking changes
