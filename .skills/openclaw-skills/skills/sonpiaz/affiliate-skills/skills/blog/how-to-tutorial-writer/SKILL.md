# How-To Tutorial Writer

Write practical, step-by-step tutorial blog posts that solve a real reader problem and naturally recommend affiliate products as the best tool for the job. Uses the "problem → solution → tool" pattern: establish what the reader wants to do, show them exactly how to do it, and position the affiliate product as the right instrument for each step.

## When to Use

- User wants to create educational content that drives affiliate conversions indirectly
- User says "how to", "tutorial", "guide", "walkthrough", "step by step"
- User wants to rank for "how to [task]" keywords (high traffic, lower competition than "best" keywords)
- User has a product that is best understood through demonstration, not just description
- User wants to build authority and trust in a niche before making a sale

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Tutorial Goal

Parse the request to identify:
- **The task**: what the reader wants to accomplish (e.g., "create AI videos for YouTube")
- **The tool**: which affiliate product enables the task (e.g., HeyGen)
- **The audience**: who is asking this question (beginner / intermediate / advanced)
- **The end state**: what the reader will have built or achieved by the end

If the task is vague ("write a tutorial about HeyGen"), default to the most popular use case for that tool — search for it: `"[product name] tutorial" OR "how to use [product name]"` — pick the highest-traffic query.

**Tutorial types** — detect from user's phrasing:
| Signal | Type | Format |
|---|---|---|
| "How to get started", "beginners guide", "first time" | `quickstart` | 5-8 steps, 1,500-2,000 words |
| "Step by step", "complete guide", "full tutorial" | `deep-dive` | 8-15 steps, 2,500-3,500 words |
| "How to [specific feature]" | `feature-focus` | 5-8 steps on one feature, 1,500-2,000 words |
| "How to [goal] without [product]" → redirect to product | `problem-solution` | 6-10 steps, 2,000-2,500 words |

### Step 2: Research the Tutorial Content

Use `web_search` to gather:
1. The actual step-by-step process for accomplishing the task
2. Common mistakes or gotchas beginners encounter
3. Official documentation or help articles for the product
4. What the top-ranking tutorials already cover (identify gaps)

Search queries:
- `"how to [task] with [product]"` — understand existing guides
- `"[product] tutorial [year]"` — find current instructions
- `"[product] [feature] settings"` — get accurate step names
- `"[task] mistakes beginners make"` — find pain points to address

**Content accuracy rule**: Never invent product UI details. If unsure about a specific button name or menu path, describe the action generically ("navigate to the settings section") rather than naming something that may be wrong.

### Step 3: Plan the Tutorial Structure

Map every section before writing. A well-structured tutorial follows this flow:

**What readers need before starting (Prerequisites):**
- Account requirements (free plan vs. paid tier needed for tutorial steps)
- Technical requirements
- Assets they should have ready (images, scripts, data)

**The steps themselves:**
- Each step = one atomic action (not a cluster of actions)
- Steps should be numbered, not just bulleted
- Each step has: action verb headline + explanation + expected result
- Decision points get callout boxes: "If you see X, do Y instead"

**Affiliate integration points** (natural, not forced):
1. In the Prerequisites section: "You'll need a [Product] account. [Sign up free here →](url)"
2. At the step where the product's key feature is used: contextual CTA
3. After showing the final result: "You just did X with [Product]. Here's what else it can do: [affiliate CTA]"
4. In the "Next Steps" section at the end

**Rule**: Never interrupt a step sequence with a hard sell. CTAs belong at natural pause points — before the reader starts, after they finish a major phase, and at the very end.

### Step 4: Write the Full Tutorial

**Title formula:**
- `How to [Task] with [Product]: Step-by-Step Guide ([Year])`
- `How to [Task]: A Beginner's Guide Using [Product]`
- `[Goal]: How to [Task] in [N] Steps (Even If You're New to [Topic])`

**Introduction (150-200 words):**
- Open with the reader's problem/desire (not with "In this tutorial...")
- State the end result: "By the end, you'll have [specific output]"
- Mention how long it takes and what level of experience is needed
- One-sentence product intro: "[Product] is what makes this possible — here's how to use it."
- Affiliate CTA if they need to sign up before starting

**Prerequisites section:**
```
**What you need before starting:**
- A [Product] account (free plan works / Pro plan required for [specific feature])
  → [Create your free account →](affiliate_url)
- [Any other required tool/asset/knowledge]
- Estimated time: [X minutes]
```

**Step-by-Step Section:**
Write each step as:
```
## Step [N]: [Action Verb] + [What You're Doing]

[2-4 sentence explanation of what this step does and why it matters]

1. [Specific sub-action with exact UI element names where known]
2. [Next sub-action]
3. [Continue...]

**You should see:** [description of what the expected result looks like]

> **Note:** [Optional callout for a common mistake or alternative path]
```

**Result/Output Section:**
After all steps, show what the reader has built:
- Describe the final output in concrete terms
- Include what they can do with it now
- Contextual affiliate CTA: "Now that you've [achieved X], you can use [Product]'s [feature] to take it further."

**Troubleshooting Section** (optional, high SEO value):
3-5 common issues readers might hit:
- "Error: [X]" → "This usually means [Y]. Fix it by [Z]."
- "Step 4 doesn't work if [condition]" → "Instead, try [alternative]."

**Next Steps Section:**
- What to do with the result
- Related features of the product to explore next
- Related tutorials (if user has other content)
- Final strong affiliate CTA

**FAQ Section (4-6 questions):**
- "Do I need a paid plan for [product] to follow this tutorial?"
- "How long does [task] take?"
- "Can I do this without [product]?"
- "Is [product] free to use for [task]?"
- "What should I do if [common problem]?"

### Step 5: Format Output

**Part 1: SEO Metadata**
```
---
SEO METADATA
---
Title: [title]
Slug: how-to-[task-slug]
Meta Description: [150-160 chars — include "how to", the task, and product name]
Target Keyword: how to [task] with [product]
Secondary Keywords: [product] tutorial, [task] guide, how to [task] [year], [product] for beginners
Word Count: [actual]
Format: how-to
Steps: [N]
---
```

**Part 2: Full Article**
Complete markdown ready to publish.

**Part 3: Supplementary Data**
- FAQ schema questions/answers
- Screenshot suggestions (one per major step)
- Products featured with affiliate URLs
- Video script outline (optional — if user wants to turn this into a YouTube tutorial)

## Input Schema

```yaml
task:                       # REQUIRED — what the reader wants to accomplish
  description: string       # e.g., "create an AI avatar video for YouTube"
  goal: string              # The end state — "a published YouTube video with AI avatar"

product:                    # REQUIRED — the affiliate tool that enables the task
  name: string
  description: string
  reward_value: string
  url: string               # Affiliate link
  reward_type: string
  cookie_days: number
  tags: string[]

tutorial_type: string       # OPTIONAL — "quickstart" | "deep-dive" | "feature-focus" | "problem-solution"
                            # Default: auto-detected from task complexity

audience_level: string      # OPTIONAL — "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
                            # Default: "beginner" (wider audience)

  - name: string
    url: string
    purpose: string         # What role this tool plays in the tutorial

target_keyword: string      # OPTIONAL — override default "how to [task]" keyword

tone: string                # OPTIONAL — "conversational" | "technical"
                            # Default: "conversational"

                                # Default: false
```

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Steps are numbered (not bulleted) and atomic — one action per step
- [ ] Prerequisites section is present with requirements and time estimate
- [ ] FTC disclosure appears after title
- [ ] No invented UI details — describe generically if unsure
- [ ] CTA never interrupts a step sequence

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
article:
  title: string
  slug: string
  meta_description: string
  target_keyword: string
  format: "how-to"
  tutorial_type: string     # quickstart | deep-dive | feature-focus | problem-solution
  content: string
  word_count: number
  steps:
    - number: number
      headline: string      # Step heading
      affiliate_cta: boolean # Whether this step contains a CTA

products_featured:
  - name: string
    url: string
    role: string            # "primary-tool" | "supporting-tool"
    reward_value: string
    cta_placement: string[] # Which sections contain CTAs for this product

seo:
  secondary_keywords: string[]
  faq_questions:
    - question: string
      answer: string
  screenshot_suggestions:   # One per major step — high-value for tutorials
    - step: number
      description: string
      alt_text: string

video_outline:              # Only if include_video_outline=true
  title: string
  hook: string              # First 30 seconds script
  chapters:
    - timestamp: string     # e.g., "0:00"
      title: string
  description_for_youtube: string
  tags: string[]
```

## Output Format

Present as three sections:
1. **SEO Metadata** — fenced block for copy-paste into CMS
2. **Article** — complete markdown, immediately publishable
3. **Supplementary** — FAQ schema, screenshot suggestions, affiliate URLs, optional video outline

Target word count: 1,500-3,500 words based on tutorial type. Quality over length — do not pad steps.

## Error Handling

- **Task too vague** ("tutorial about email marketing"): Ask: "What specific task should the tutorial walk through? For example: 'how to set up an automated welcome email sequence in Mailchimp'."
- **No product provided**: "Which product should this tutorial feature? If you don't have one in mind, I can suggest the best tool for [task]."
- **Product feature requires paid plan**: Note clearly in Prerequisites section and add affiliate CTA. Do not hide paid requirements.
- **Task not suited for a single tutorial** (too complex): "This task has multiple phases — I'll write a [quickstart] tutorial focused on [first phase]. Let me know if you want additional tutorials for the other phases."
- **Product UI has changed**: Use generic action descriptions where UI details are uncertain. Add note: "Screenshots may vary slightly from your current version of [Product]."

## Examples

**Example 1: Product-driven tutorial**
User: "Write a tutorial on how to create AI avatar videos with HeyGen"
Action: task="create AI avatar video", product=HeyGen, audience=beginner, tutorial_type=deep-dive, write 12-step guide targeting "how to create ai avatar video with heygen".

**Example 2: Goal-driven tutorial**
User: "Write a how-to guide for automating social media posts"
Action: web_search for best social media automation tool, present to user for affiliate selection (or auto-select if S1 already ran), write problem-solution tutorial targeting "how to automate social media posts".

**Example 3: Feature-specific tutorial**
User: "Tutorial on how to use Semrush keyword magic tool"
Action: task="find keywords with Semrush Keyword Magic Tool", tutorial_type=feature-focus, write focused 8-step guide, affiliate CTAs at start and end.

**Example 4: With video outline**
User: "Write a HeyGen tutorial that I can also use as a YouTube video script"
Action: Same as Example 1 but with include_video_outline=true, output includes full video description, chapter markers, and hook script.
