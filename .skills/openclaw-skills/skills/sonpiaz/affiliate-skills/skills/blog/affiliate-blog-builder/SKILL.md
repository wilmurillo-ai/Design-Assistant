# Affiliate Blog Builder

Write full SEO-optimized blog articles that rank on Google and drive passive affiliate revenue. Supports four formats: product review, head-to-head comparison, best-of listicle, and how-to guide. Each article includes keyword strategy, structured headings, comparison tables, CTAs, FAQ schema, and FTC-compliant disclosure.

## Stage

S3: Blog — The highest-value content type in the affiliate funnel. Blog articles rank on Google, drive organic traffic for months/years, and convert at higher rates than social posts because readers have high purchase intent.

## When to Use

- User wants to write a blog post reviewing an affiliate product
- User wants a comparison article (Product A vs Product B)
- User wants a "best of" listicle for a product category
- User wants a how-to tutorial that naturally promotes an affiliate product
- User has a product from S1 (affiliate-program-search) and wants to create long-form content
- User says anything like "write a blog", "SEO article", "product review post", "roundup post"

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED — the affiliate product to feature
  name: string              # Product name (e.g., "HeyGen")
  description: string       # What it does
  reward_value: string      # Commission (e.g., "30% recurring")
  url: string               # Affiliate link URL
  reward_type: string       # "recurring" | "one-time" | "tiered"
  cookie_days: number       # Cookie duration
  tags: string[]            # e.g., ["ai", "video", "saas"]

format: string              # OPTIONAL — "review" | "comparison" | "listicle" | "how-to"
                            # Default: "listicle" (highest traffic potential)

compare_with: object[]      # OPTIONAL — competitors for comparison/listicle formats
  - name: string            # Competitor name
    description: string     # Brief description
    url: string             # URL (non-affiliate OK)
    pricing: string         # Starting price

target_keyword: string      # OPTIONAL — primary SEO keyword to target
                            # Default: auto-generated from product name + category

blog_platform: string       # OPTIONAL — "wordpress" | "ghost" | "hugo" | "astro" | "webflow" | "markdown"
                            # Default: "markdown" (universal)

tone: string                # OPTIONAL — "professional" | "conversational" | "technical"
                            # Default: "conversational"

word_count_target: number   # OPTIONAL — override default word count for the format
```

**Chaining from S1**: If `affiliate-program-search` was run earlier in the conversation, automatically pick up `recommended_program` from its output as the `product` input. The field mapping:
- `recommended_program.name` → `product.name`
- `recommended_program.description` → `product.description`
- `recommended_program.reward_value` → `product.reward_value`
- `recommended_program.url` → `product.url`
- `recommended_program.reward_type` → `product.reward_type`
- `recommended_program.cookie_days` → `product.cookie_days`
- `recommended_program.tags` → `product.tags`

If the user says "now write a blog about it" after running S1 — use the recommended program. No need to ask again.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Format

Choose the article format based on user request or defaults:

| Signal | Format |
|---|---|
| User says "review", "my experience with" | `review` |
| User mentions two+ products, "vs", "compare" | `comparison` |
| User says "best", "top", "roundup", numbers | `listicle` |
| User says "how to", "tutorial", "guide", "step by step" | `how-to` |
| No clear signal | `listicle` (default — highest traffic potential) |

If `format = comparison` and `compare_with` is empty or has only 1 product:
- Use `web_search` to find 2-3 top competitors in the same category
- Search query: `"best alternatives to [product.name]" OR "[product.name] vs" site:g2.com OR site:capterra.com`

If `format = listicle` and `compare_with` is empty:
- Use `web_search` to find 4-6 products in the same category
- Search query: `"best [product category] tools [year]"`

### Step 2: SEO Framework

Read `references/seo-checklist.md` for the complete SEO guidelines. Then:

1. **Generate target keyword** (if not provided):
   - Review format: `[product name] review`
   - Comparison: `[product A] vs [product B]`
   - Listicle: `best [category] tools`
   - How-to: `how to [goal] with [product/category]`

2. **Generate secondary keywords** (3-5):
   - Use `web_search` for: `"[target keyword]" related searches` and "People Also Ask"
   - Include: `[product] pricing`, `[product] alternatives`, `[product] pros and cons`, `is [product] worth it`

3. **Build title** using the formula from seo-checklist.md matching the format

4. **Write meta description** (150-160 chars) following the checklist format

5. **Plan heading structure**:
   - Map out all H2/H3 headings before writing
   - Ensure target keyword appears in at least 2 H2s
   - Ensure secondary keywords appear in H3s
   - Follow the heading hierarchy from seo-checklist.md

6. **Generate slug** from target keyword (lowercase, hyphens, no stop words)

### Step 3: Write Article

Read `references/blog-templates.md` and use the template matching the chosen format. Then write the full article following these rules:

**Content Rules:**
- Follow the exact template structure for the chosen format
- Write in the specified `tone` (default: conversational)
- Hit the word count target for the format (review: 2-3.5K, comparison: 2.5-3.5K, listicle: 3-5K, how-to: 2-3K)
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Include bullet points and numbered lists for scannability
- Write like a real person who has used the product — specific details, not generic fluff

**Required Sections (all formats):**
- FTC disclosure near the top — read `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` and use the **medium** format
- Comparison table (at least one, even in reviews — compare to alternatives)
- Pros and cons for every recommended product
- "Who is this best for?" audience targeting
- Pricing information with affiliate CTA
- FAQ section (3-5 questions)
- Final verdict with clear recommendation and affiliate CTA

**Affiliate CTA Placement (2-4 per article):**
1. After the pricing section
2. After a key feature demonstration
3. In the final verdict
4. Optionally: in a callout box after the "who is this for" section

**CTA Formats:**
- Soft: `[Try [Product] free →]([affiliate_url])`
- Medium: `**Ready to get started?** [Sign up for [Product] →]([affiliate_url])`
- Strong (verdict only): `**Our recommendation**: [Get [Product] here]([affiliate_url]) — [brief value prop].`

**Things to AVOID:**
- No Affitor branding in the article body (this is the user's blog, not ours)
- No "AI-generated" disclaimers (the user will edit and personalize)
- No placeholder text like "[insert your experience here]" — write complete content. If personal experience is needed, write realistic example scenarios clearly marked as examples
- No keyword stuffing — natural language only
- No false claims about products

### Step 4: Format Output

Produce the final output in this exact structure:

**Part 1: SEO Metadata Block**
```
---
SEO METADATA
---
Title: [SEO title]
Slug: [url-slug]
Meta Description: [150-160 chars]
Target Keyword: [primary keyword]
Secondary Keywords: [comma-separated list]
Word Count: [actual count]
Format: [review/comparison/listicle/how-to]
---
```

**Part 2: Full Article**
The complete markdown article ready to paste into any blogging platform.

**Part 3: Supplementary Data**
```
---
SUPPLEMENTARY
---
FAQ Questions (for schema markup):
1. [Question] → [Answer]
2. [Question] → [Answer]
...

Image Suggestions:
1. [Description] — alt: "[alt text]"
2. [Description] — alt: "[alt text]"
...

Products Featured:
- [Product 1]: [affiliate URL] (featured/mentioned)
- [Product 2]: [affiliate URL] (compared/mentioned)
...

Next Steps:
- Personalize: Add your own experience, screenshots, and results
- Images: Take product screenshots and add them at suggested locations
- Links: Replace affiliate URLs with your own tracking links
- Publish: See references/wordpress-deploy.md for WordPress setup guide
- Promote: Run viral-post-writer to create social posts promoting this article
---
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Word count meets format target (review: 2-3.5K, comparison: 2.5-3.5K, listicle: 3-5K, how-to: 2-3K)
- [ ] FTC disclosure near top of article, medium format
- [ ] 2-4 CTAs placed at: after pricing, feature demo, verdict, optional callout box
- [ ] Meta description is 150-160 characters
- [ ] Target keyword appears naturally in first 100 words
- [ ] No placeholder text, no AI-generated disclaimers

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
article:
  title: string             # SEO-optimized title
  slug: string              # URL-friendly slug
  meta_description: string  # 150-160 character meta description
  target_keyword: string    # Primary keyword targeted
  format: string            # review | comparison | listicle | how-to
  content: string           # Full markdown article
  word_count: number        # Actual word count
  headings:                 # Article structure
    - level: number         # 2 for H2, 3 for H3
      text: string          # Heading text

seo:
  secondary_keywords: string[]    # 3-5 secondary keywords used
  faq_questions:                  # For FAQ schema markup
    - question: string
      answer: string
  image_suggestions:              # Recommended images
    - description: string         # What to screenshot/create
      alt_text: string            # SEO alt text
      placement: string           # After which section

products_featured:                # All products mentioned
  - name: string
    url: string                   # Affiliate URL
    role: string                  # "primary" | "compared" | "mentioned"
    reward_value: string          # Commission info
    pricing: string | null        # Starting price (e.g., "$49/mo") — for S4 landing page chaining
```

## Output Format

Present the output as a single markdown document with three clearly separated sections:
1. **SEO Metadata** — fenced block with all SEO settings for easy copy into WordPress/Yoast
2. **Article** — the full blog post in markdown, ready to paste
3. **Supplementary** — FAQ for schema markup, image suggestions, products list, and next steps

The article should be **immediately publishable** — not a draft or outline. The user should be able to copy-paste it into their blog editor, add their own screenshots and personal touches, and publish.

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to write about. Run `/affiliate-program-search` first to find one, or tell me the product name and I'll research it."
- **Comparison with only 1 product**: Auto-search for 2-3 competitors using `web_search`. Search: `"best alternatives to [product]"` on G2/Capterra.
- **No compare_with for listicle**: Auto-search for 4-6 products in the category. Inform user: "I found these products to include — let me know if you want to swap any."
- **Unknown blog platform**: Default to markdown output. Add note: "This is universal markdown — works with WordPress, Ghost, Hugo, Astro, and most platforms."
- **Product has no public info**: Use `web_search` to research the product. If still insufficient: "I couldn't find enough information about [product] to write a credible article. Can you provide more details about features, pricing, and your experience?"
- **Controversial or questionable product**: Include balanced pros/cons. Add note: "This product has mixed reviews — make sure you've personally verified these claims before publishing."

## Examples

### Example 1: Product Review (chained from S1)
**User**: "Now write a detailed review of HeyGen for my blog"
**Context**: S1 previously returned HeyGen as recommended_program
**Action**: Auto-detect format=review, pick up HeyGen product data from S1 output, generate full review article targeting "heygen review" keyword.

### Example 2: Comparison Article
**User**: "Write a comparison blog post: HeyGen vs Synthesia vs Colossyan for AI video creation"
**Action**: Format=comparison, primary product=HeyGen (if from S1, else first mentioned), compare_with=[Synthesia, Colossyan], target keyword="heygen vs synthesia vs colossyan".

### Example 3: Listicle (Default Format)
**User**: "Write a blog post about the best AI video tools"
**Action**: Format=listicle (matches "best"), web_search for top AI video tools, target keyword="best ai video tools", write 3-5K word roundup with 5-7 products.

### Example 4: How-To Guide
**User**: "Write a tutorial blog post on how to create AI-generated videos for YouTube with HeyGen"
**Action**: Format=how-to (matches "tutorial", "how to"), target keyword="how to create ai videos for youtube", write step-by-step guide featuring HeyGen with affiliate CTAs.

### Example 5: Minimal Input
**User**: "Blog post about Semrush"
**Action**: No format specified → default to listicle? No — single product implies review. Use format=review, web_search Semrush for features/pricing/reviews, target keyword="semrush review", generate full article.

**Format detection logic for ambiguous cases**: If only one product is mentioned with no format keyword, default to `review`. If a category is mentioned with no specific product, default to `listicle`.
