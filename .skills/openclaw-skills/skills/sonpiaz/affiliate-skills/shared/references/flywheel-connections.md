## chain_metadata

Every skill output includes this metadata block for agent orchestration:

```yaml
chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: string        # e.g., "affiliate-program-search"
  stage: string             # e.g., "research"
  timestamp: string         # ISO 8601
  suggested_next: string[]  # e.g., ["viral-post-writer", "landing-page-creator"]
```

Agents use `suggested_next` to auto-chain skills without user intervention. The flywheel ensures `suggested_next` for S6 skills always includes S1 skills.
