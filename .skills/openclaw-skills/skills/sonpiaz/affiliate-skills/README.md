### Without affiliate-skills

- You Google "best affiliate programs" and get SEO spam written to rank, not to help
- You write a blog review and guess if the CTA, headline, or disclosure is any good
- You have no idea which content actually drives clicks — you just hope
- You spend 4 hours on a landing page that converts at 0.2%
- You pick programs by vibes instead of data

### With affiliate-skills

| Skill | Mode | What it does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Program Search | Data analyst | Live program data from list.affitor.com — commissions, cookies, comparisons. |
| Research | Scout | Score and rank programs. Find the best one for your niche. |
| Funnel Planner | Strategist | Week-by-week roadmap from zero to revenue. Chain skills automatically. |
| Content, Blog, Landing, Distribution | Creator | 20 skills that write posts, articles, pages, and deploy them. |

| Compliance, Self-improver | Safety net | FTC audit before you publish. Retrospective after you launch. |

## Demo: zero to first commission

```
You:  I want to promote AI video tools. What's the best program?

AI:   [queries list.affitor.com API]

       Name                      Commission           Cookie     Stars
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       HeyGen                    30% recurring        60 days    ★ 127
       Synthesia                 25% one-time         30 days    ★ 84
       D-ID                      20% recurring        45 days    ★ 52

      HeyGen is the clear winner: highest commission, recurring, longest
      cookie. Let me research it in depth.

You:  Write a blog review of HeyGen for content creators.

AI:   [runs affiliate-blog-builder skill]
      [2,000-word SEO review with pros/cons, comparison table,
       FTC disclosure, and affiliate CTA]

You:  Create a landing page for this.

AI:   [runs landing-page-creator skill]
      [single-file HTML/CSS page, AIDA framework, mobile-responsive,
       ready to deploy]

You:  Plan my full funnel — I have 5 hours/week and I blog.

AI:   [runs funnel-planner skill]

      Week 1: Research (affiliate-program-search) → select 2-3 programs
      Week 2: Content (viral-post-writer) → 5 LinkedIn + Twitter posts
      Week 3: Blog (affiliate-blog-builder) → 1 review article
      Week 4: Deploy (bio-link-deployer) → bio link page live
      Week 5: Analytics (seo-audit) → fix SEO issues
      Week 6: Optimize (ab-test-generator) → test headlines

      Success metric: first affiliate click by week 3, first commission
      by week 6.
```

## Who this is for

You want to do affiliate marketing with AI — not by hand. You want data-driven program selection, not guesswork. You want content that converts, not content that exists.

This is not a prompt pack for beginners. It is an operating system for affiliates who ship.

## Get Started

> **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** — Platform-specific setup for Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, and more.

### Fastest way (any AI, no install)

1. Copy the [bootstrap prompt](prompts/bootstrap.md) (everything below the `---` line)
2. Paste it into your AI
3. Start: *"Find me the best SaaS affiliate programs with recurring commission"*

### Claude Code (full integration)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Affitor/affiliate-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/affiliate-skills
cd ~/.claude/skills/affiliate-skills && ./setup
```

Then tell Claude to add affiliate-skills to your project's CLAUDE.md. You get slash commands, the `affiliate-check` CLI, and automatic skill discovery.

### ChatGPT / Gemini / Any AI

1. Copy [`prompts/bootstrap.md`](prompts/bootstrap.md) into your conversation or project instructions
2. Optionally upload [`registry.json`](registry.json) and [`API.md`](API.md) as knowledge files
3. Done — your AI is now an affiliate marketing agent

### Cursor / Windsurf

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Affitor/affiliate-skills.git
```

Open the folder — `.cursorrules` configures the AI automatically.

Machine-readable index: [`registry.json`](registry.json) · API docs: [`API.md`](API.md) · Skill template: [`template/SKILL.md`](template/SKILL.md) · Spec: [`spec/`](spec/)

## How it works

Each skill is a single Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that tells any AI exactly how to execute a specific affiliate marketing task. Skills define:

- **When to trigger** — natural language patterns that activate the skill
- **Input/Output schemas** — structured data for agent interop
- **Workflow** — step-by-step procedure with decision points
- **Chaining** — how outputs from one skill feed into the next

Skills pass data through conversation context, not files. Run S1 to find a program, then S2 uses that program's data automatically — no copy-pasting.

## Entry points

You don't have to start from S1. Jump in wherever you are:

- **New to affiliate marketing:** S8 `funnel-planner` → it plans everything for you
- **Have a product already:** S2 (write content) or S3 (write a review)
- **Have content, need pages:** S4 (landing page) or S5 (bio link)
- **Want to optimize:** S6 (analytics + SEO audit)
- **Ready to scale:** S7 (automation + paid ads)
- **Not sure which skill:** S8 `skill-finder`

## For Developers

Building an agent pipeline? Here's what you need:

- **[`registry.json`](registry.json)** — machine-readable index of all 45 skills with metadata
- **[`API.md`](API.md)** — full REST API documentation for list.affitor.com
- **[`prompts/bootstrap.md`](prompts/bootstrap.md)** — system prompt that bootstraps the full agent
- **`agents/openai.yaml`** — OpenAI-compatible tool definitions (in skills that have them)
- **Input/Output schemas** — every SKILL.md has typed schemas for structured data exchange
