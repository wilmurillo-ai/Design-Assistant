# Agent Skills Specification

This repo follows the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) — a universal standard that works with any AI agent platform (Claude, GPT, Gemini, and others). The spec was originally seeded by [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) and is maintained as an open, platform-neutral standard.

## Required Frontmatter

Every `SKILL.md` must have:

```yaml
---
name: lowercase-with-hyphens
description: >
  When the AI should activate this skill. Write in natural language,
  cover multiple trigger phrases.
---
```

## Skill Folder Structure

```

├── SKILL.md              (required)
├── LICENSE.txt            (required — MIT or Apache 2.0)

```
