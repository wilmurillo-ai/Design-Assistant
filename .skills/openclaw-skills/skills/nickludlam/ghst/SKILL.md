# `ghst` CLI Skill

This skill wraps the [ghst](https://github.com/TryGhost/ghst) CLI tool, which allows the agent to interact directly with any Ghost instance via the Ghost Admin API.

## Prerequisites & Installation

For this skill to function, the `ghst` binary must be available in the system's `$PATH`.

### Local Installation

Install the CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @tryghost/ghst
```

Alternatively, you can run it via `npx` without a permanent installation (though this is slower for repeated agent tasks):

```bash
npx @tryghost/ghst --help
```

### Docker / Containerized Environments

If you are running OpenClaw in Docker, ensure the `ghst` binary is included in your container image by adding the installation command to your `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
RUN npm install -g @tryghost/ghst
```

## Configuration & Authentication

To interact with a Ghost instance, the agent requires a Ghost API URL and a Ghost Staff Access Token. There are two main ways to achieve this within the ghst skill:

1. **Explicit flags**: `--url` and `--staff-token`
2. **Environment variables**: `GHOST_URL` and `GHOST_STAFF_ACCESS_TOKEN`


### Instructions for Bot Owners

1. Navigate to your Ghost Admin panel.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Staff** (or **Users**) -> Edit your User Profile.
3. At the bottom, generate or copy a **Staff Access Token**.

**Option 1 — `~/.openclaw/.env` (recommended for personal use)**

Add the variables directly to your `~/.openclaw/.env` file:

```env
GHOST_URL="https://your-blog-url.ghost.io"
GHOST_STAFF_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-staff-access-token-id:secret"
```

**Option 2: `openclaw.json` skill entry (per-skill injection)**

In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, add an `env` block under your skill's entry:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "ghst": {
        "enabled": true,
        "env": {
          "GHOST_URL": "https://your-blog-url.ghost.io",
          "GHOST_STAFF_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-staff-access-token-id:secret"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once configured, restart your agent or wait for the config to be picked up.

### Advanced Environment Variables

For complex setups, the following environment variables are supported:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GHOST_URL` | Canonical URL of the Ghost instance. |
| `GHOST_STAFF_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `{id}:{secret}` for Admin API access. |
| `GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY` | Hex key for Content API access (via `ghst api --content-api`). |
| `GHOST_API_VERSION` | Target API version (e.g., `v5.0`). Defaults to latest. |
| `GHOST_SITE` | Default site alias/profile to use. |
| `GHST_CONFIG_DIR` | Custom path for CLI configuration. |
| `GHST_OUTPUT` | Set to `json` to force JSON output globally. |
| `NO_COLOR` | Disable ANSI color sequences. |


## Agent Guidelines & Usage

When operating the `ghst` skill, the agent must adhere to the following rules to ensure robust and safe usage.

### 1. Robust Scripting

- **Always use `--json` or `--jq`**: Ensure your commands produce machine-readable JSON output rather than human-readable text.
  ```bash
  ghst post list --json
  ghst post list --json --jq '.posts[].title'
  ```
- **Use `--non-interactive`**: Since you are running in an automated environment, never issue commands that prompt for user input unexpectedly. Use `--yes` in combination with `--non-interactive` for any required destructive operations that you have received user approval for.
  ```bash
  ghst comment delete <comment-id> --yes --non-interactive
  ```
- **Non-Interactive Auth**: If you need to authenticate a new site programmatically:
  ```bash
  ghst auth login --non-interactive --url "https://blog.com" --staff-token "..."
  ```

### 2. Editing Posts and Pages

For detailed instructions on the "Read-Edit-Write" workflow to edit post or page lexical content (including minor rewording and URL changes), see the [`editing.md`](references/editing.md) reference.

### 3. Searching and Filtering Posts and Pages

When you need to find specific posts or pages (e.g., by title, status, or tag), refer to the advanced filtering and NQL query examples documented in [`post.md`](references/post.md) and [`page.md`](references/page.md).

### Command Reference

Detailed documentation for each resource can be found in the `references/` directory:

| Resource | Description |

| [`ghst tag`](references/tag.md) | Create and manage site tags. |
| [`ghst member`](references/member.md) | Manage members, imports, exports, and bulk operations. |
| [`ghst socialweb`](references/socialweb.md) | ActivityPub feeds, profile management, and social interactions. |
| [`ghst comment`](references/comment.md) | Moderate, hide, show, and delete comments. |

**Example Workflows:**

*   **Bulk Post Tagging**: `ghst post bulk --filter "status:draft" --update --add-tag "Release"`
*   **Member Cleanup**: `ghst member bulk --filter "status:free" --action delete --yes --non-interactive`
*   **Analytics Export**: `ghst stats posts --range 30d --csv --output ./report.csv`
*   **Social Interaction**: `ghst socialweb note --content "Hello from the CLI"`


### 4. Safe Operation & Protections

- **Approvals & Notices**: You must explicitly ask the user before performing destructive commands or bulk updates. **Note**: The CLI emits `GHST_AGENT_NOTICE:` lines on `stderr` when a manual confirmation is interrupted. If you see this, you **must** stop and ask the user for explicit approval.
- **Destructive Commands**: Always use `--yes --non-interactive` for the following once approved:
    - `ghst member bulk --action delete`
    - `ghst label bulk --action delete`
    - `ghst socialweb delete`
    - `ghst auth logout`
    - `ghst auth link` (when replacing active link)
- **File Safety**: CLI tools like `member export` and `migrate export` will refuse to overwrite existing files. Check for file existence before exporting if necessary.
- **Security Check**: Never print or output sensitive tokens (e.g., values coming from `ghst auth token` or `config --show-secrets`) into the chat unprompted. Treat them as privileged credentials.
