# MPP Router — Service Discovery

Discover paid API services available via MPP Router at
`https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev`. The router proxies 489 endpoints
across 88 services (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, fal.ai, Exa,
Firecrawl, Replicate, Stability AI, Perplexity, Suno, Grok, Brave
Search, Alchemy, and more), payable with Stellar USDC.

## When to use

Activate when the user asks to:
- Find a paid API service (search, AI, image generation, scraping, etc.)
- Discover what services MPP Router offers
- Look up pricing or docs for a specific service
- Search for services by category or keyword

## Don't have a Stellar wallet yet?

Discovery itself is free, but to **call** a service you need a Stellar
USDC wallet that speaks the 402 payment flow. Use the companion skill:

> **`stellar-agent-wallet-skill`** —
> https://github.com/mpprouter/stellar-agent-wallet-skill

## How to use

1. **Read this SKILL.md first** so the agent knows the catalog shape,
   the `public_path` / `method` fields, and the 402 payment contract.
2. **Search the catalog** with `/v1/services/search?q=...` or get the
   full list with `/v1/services/catalog`.
3. **Read the picked service's `docs.llms_txt`** to learn the request
   body shape — the router forwards bodies as-is.
4. **Hand off to `stellar-agent-wallet-skill`'s `pay-per-call`** with
   the URL, method, and body. It handles 402 → sign → retry.

## Example run

```bash
# 1. Search for a web-search service
curl -s "https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/v1/services/search?q=search&status=active&limit=3" \
  | jq '.services[] | {id, public_path, method, price, docs}'

# → picks e.g. parallel_search:
# {
#   "id": "parallel_search",
#   "public_path": "/v1/services/parallel/search",
#   "method": "POST",
#   "price": "$0.010/request",
#   "docs": { "llms_txt": "https://parallel.ai/docs/llms.txt" }
# }

# 2. Read the upstream docs to learn the body shape
curl -s https://parallel.ai/docs/llms.txt | head -40

# 3. Call it via stellar-agent-wallet-skill (installed separately)
npx tsx skills/pay-per-call/run.ts \
  "https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/v1/services/parallel/search" \
  --method POST \
  --body '{"query": "Summarize https://stripe.com/docs"}'
# → 402 Payment Required → signs with Stellar USDC → retries → returns result
```

## How it works

### 1. Search services

```bash
curl -s "https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/v1/services/search?q=KEYWORD&status=active&limit=10"
```

Parameters:
- `q` — keyword search across id, name, description
- `category` — filter by category (ai, media, search, blockchain, data, etc.)
- `status` — `active` (has llms_txt docs, recommended) or `limited` (use with caution)
- `limit` — max results (default 20, max 100)
- `offset` — pagination offset

Response:
```json
{
  "total": 7,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0,
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "openai_chat",
      "name": "OpenAI",
      "description": "...",
      "public_path": "/v1/services/openai/chat",
      "price": "free",
      "status": "active",
      "docs": { "llms_txt": "https://..." },
      "methods": { "stellar": { "intents": ["charge"] } }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Get full catalog

```bash
curl -s "https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/v1/services/catalog"
```

Returns all ~489 services. Use search instead for targeted queries.

### 3. Read service docs

When a service has `docs.llms_txt`, fetch it to learn the request body format:

```bash
curl -s "<llms_txt_url>"
```

### 4. Call a service

```bash
curl -X POST "https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/v1/services/{service}/{operation}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"your": "request body"}'
```

First call returns `402 Payment Required` with payment details.
Sign with Stellar USDC and retry with `Payment-Signature` header (x402)
or `Authorization: Payment` header (mppx).
