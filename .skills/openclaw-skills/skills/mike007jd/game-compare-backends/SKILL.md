# Game Compare Backends

## Goal
Help choose between backend profiles when the choice is genuinely uncertain.

## Important warning
Compare mode usually costs more tokens and time than a single recommended route.
Say this explicitly before or while using it.

## Good use cases
- greenfield work where two routes appear plausibly viable
- UI-first vs world-first uncertainty
- 2D vs lightweight 3D preview uncertainty

## Bad use cases
- obvious stack choice
- live-product iteration
- post-architecture situations where the real blocker is not the backend

## Deliverable
Update `docs/game-studio/backend-decision.md` with:
- compared options
- criteria
- result
- why the winner won
- token / cost note
