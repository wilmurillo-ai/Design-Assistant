# Game Architecture Maintainability Audit

## Goal
Audit technical structure and changeability, especially where future iteration will become painful.

## Deliverables
Update:
- `docs/game-studio/audit/audit-summary.md`
- `docs/game-studio/audit/scorecard.json`
- `docs/game-studio/audit/risk-register.md`

Use:
- `./shared/checklists/architecture-maintainability-audit-checklist.md`
- `./shared/reference/game-dev-abstractions.md`

## Evaluate
- state management clarity
- coupling between UI, gameplay, systems, and content
- module boundaries and change surfaces
- hidden complexity and implicit contracts
- where future AI edits are likely to rot the codebase
