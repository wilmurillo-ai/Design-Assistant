## Audio Output Formats

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **MP3** | Standard audio delivery, voiceovers, music |
| Combined with video | Background music for video-cog outputs |

---

## Chat Mode for Audio

**Use `chat_mode="agent"`** for all audio generation tasks.

Audio generation—whether voiceovers, music, or sound design—executes efficiently in agent mode. CellCog's audio capabilities don't require multi-angle deliberation; they require precise execution, which agent mode excels at.

There's no scenario where agent team mode provides meaningfully better audio output. Save agent team for research and complex creative work that benefits from multiple reasoning passes.

## Tips for Better Audio

1. **Choose the right voice**: Match the voice to your content type. Cedar/marin for professional, ballad/sage for storytelling, coral for energy.

2. **Provide the complete script**: Don't say "something about our product" - write out exactly what should be said.

3. **Include style instructions**: "Confident but warm", "slow and deliberate", "with slight excitement" helps shape delivery.

4. **For music**: Specify duration, tempo (BPM if you know it), mood, and genre.

5. **Pronunciation guidance**: For names or technical terms, add hints: "CellCog (pronounced SELL-kog)"

6. **Emotional beats**: For longer voiceovers, indicate tone shifts: "[excited] And now for the big reveal... [serious] But there's a catch."
