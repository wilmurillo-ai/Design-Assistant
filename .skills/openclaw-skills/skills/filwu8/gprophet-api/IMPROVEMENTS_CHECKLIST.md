## Security Scan Issues - Resolution Status

### ✅ Issue 1: Metadata Mismatch on Credentials

- [x] Added format and acquisition URL
- [x] Verified consistency across all files

**Verification**:
```bash
cat _meta.json | grep -A 5 "credentials"
# Should show: "required": true, "environment_variable": "GPROPHET_API_KEY"
```

### ✅ Issue 3: Missing Homepage
**Original Problem**: No homepage URL in package metadata

**Resolution** (v1.0.1):

**Verification**:
```bash
# All files should mention GPROPHET_API_KEY
grep -l "GPROPHET_API_KEY" *.md _meta.json
# Should show: README.md, SECURITY.md, SKILL.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md, _meta.json
```
