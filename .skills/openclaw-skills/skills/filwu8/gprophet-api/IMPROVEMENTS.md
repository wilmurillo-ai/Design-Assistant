# Security Scan Response & Improvements

## Summary

This document addresses the security concerns raised by ClawHub's security scan and outlines the improvements made to the G-Prophet API skill package.

## Issues Identified

The security scan flagged the following concerns:

1. **Missing Credential Declaration**: Package metadata did not declare required API key
2. **Insecure Storage Recommendation**: README suggested storing keys in agent config files
3. **Missing Homepage**: No homepage URL in package metadata
4. **Inconsistent Documentation**: Mismatch between metadata and actual credential requirements

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Package Metadata (`_meta.json`)

**Added**:
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://www.gprophet.com",
  "credentials": {
    "required": true,
    "type": "api_key",
    "environment_variable": "GPROPHET_API_KEY",
    "description": "G-Prophet API key (format: gp_sk_*). Get yours at https://www.gprophet.com/settings/api-keys"
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Users are now explicitly warned about credential requirements before installation.

### 2. Improved README Security Section

**Removed**: Recommendation to store keys in `~/.openclaw/agents/.../auth-profiles.json`

**Added**:
- Clear security warnings and best practices
- Environment variable as primary storage method
- Key rotation recommendations
- Monitoring and incident response guidance
- Privacy and data handling information

### 3. New SECURITY.md Document

Created comprehensive security documentation covering:
- API key management and rotation
- Secure storage methods
- Data privacy and what data is sent/not sent
- Network security considerations
- Monitoring and auditing guidelines
- Incident response procedures
- Testing and evaluation best practices

### 4. Enhanced SKILL.md

Added security recommendations to the authentication section:
- Secure storage practices
- Key rotation guidelines
- Monitoring recommendations
- Version control warnings

### 5. Added CHANGELOG.md

Documented all changes and version history for transparency.

## Security Posture Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Credential Declaration | ❌ Not declared | ✅ Explicitly declared in metadata |
| Storage Recommendation | ⚠️ Agent config files | ✅ Environment variables |
| Homepage | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added |
| Security Documentation | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Comprehensive |
| Key Rotation Guidance | ❌ None | ✅ Detailed procedures |
| Incident Response | ❌ None | ✅ Step-by-step guide |
| Privacy Disclosure | ⚠️ Minimal | ✅ Detailed |

## Addressing Specific Concerns

### "Metadata omits any declared credential requirement"

**Fixed**: Added explicit `credentials` section to `_meta.json` declaring:
- Required: true
- Type: api_key
- Environment variable: GPROPHET_API_KEY
- Description with format and acquisition URL

### "README instructs placing secrets in agent files"

**Fixed**: 
- Removed all references to storing keys in agent configuration files
- Changed primary recommendation to environment variables
- Added security warnings about credential storage

### "No homepage in the registry"

**Fixed**: Added `"homepage": "https://www.gprophet.com"` to metadata

### "Inconsistency between claimed requirements and instructions"

**Fixed**: Aligned all documentation (metadata, README, SKILL.md) to consistently declare and document credential requirements

## Testing Recommendations

Before approving for publication, we recommend:

1. ✅ Verify metadata now declares credentials correctly
2. ✅ Confirm README no longer suggests insecure storage
3. ✅ Check homepage URL is accessible
4. ✅ Review SECURITY.md for completeness
5. ✅ Validate all documentation is consistent
