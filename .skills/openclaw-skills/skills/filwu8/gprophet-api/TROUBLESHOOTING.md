# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues

#### "INVALID_API_KEY" or "INVALID_KEY_FORMAT"

**Problem**: API key is rejected or malformed

**Solutions**:
1. Verify key format starts with `gp_sk_`
2. Check for extra spaces or line breaks in the key
3. Ensure the key is correctly set in environment variable:
   ```bash
   echo $GPROPHET_API_KEY  # Should show: gp_sk_...
   ```
4. Generate a new key at https://www.gprophet.com/settings/api-keys

#### "API_KEY_DISABLED" or "API_KEY_EXPIRED"

**Problem**: Your API key has been disabled or expired

**Solutions**:
1. Check your account status at https://www.gprophet.com/dashboard
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update your environment variable with the new key
4. Contact support@gprophet.com if you believe this is an error

#### "INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE"

**Problem**: Your API key lacks permission for this operation

**Solutions**:
1. Check your API key permissions at https://www.gprophet.com/settings/api-keys
2. Create a new key with broader permissions if needed
3. Contact support@gprophet.com for permission upgrades

### Billing & Points Issues

#### "INSUFFICIENT_POINTS"

**Problem**: Your account doesn't have enough points for the operation

**Solutions**:
1. Check your point balance at https://www.gprophet.com/dashboard
2. Purchase more points if needed
3. Review recent usage to identify high-cost operations
4. Consider using cheaper operations (e.g., quote instead of deep analysis)

**Cost Reference**:
- Stock prediction: 10-20 points (varies by market)
- Technical analysis: 5 points
- Market data: 5 points
- Deep analysis: 150 points

#### "POINTS_DEDUCTION_FAILED"

**Problem**: System failed to deduct points despite sufficient balance

**Solutions**:
1. Wait a few seconds and retry
2. Check your account status at https://www.gprophet.com/dashboard
3. If issue persists, contact support@gprophet.com

### Data & Symbol Issues

#### "SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND"

**Problem**: The stock/crypto ticker is not recognized

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the ticker symbol is correct:
   - US stocks: AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL (uppercase)
   - China A-shares: 6-digit code (600519, 000001)
   - HK stocks: Numeric code (700, 9988)
   - Crypto: Trading pair (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT)

2. Use the search function to find the correct symbol:
   ```bash
   /gprophet search "apple" US
   ```

3. Check market code is correct:
   - US: US stocks
   - CN: China A-shares
   - HK: Hong Kong stocks
   - CRYPTO: Cryptocurrencies

#### "INVALID_MARKET"

**Problem**: Market code is not recognized

**Solutions**:
1. Use only valid market codes: `US`, `CN`, `HK`, `CRYPTO`
2. Check for typos (case-sensitive)
3. Verify the symbol exists in the specified market

#### "NO_DATA"

**Problem**: Unable to retrieve data for the requested symbol

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the symbol is active and trading
2. Try a different time period (for historical data)
3. Check if the market is open (some markets have trading hours)
4. Try again in a few moments (data may be updating)

### Performance & Timeout Issues

#### Prediction Takes Too Long

**Problem**: Stock prediction is slow or times out

**Solutions**:
1. This is normal for complex algorithms (5-30 seconds typical)
2. Try a simpler algorithm:
   ```bash
   /gprophet predict AAPL US 7 --algorithm lstm
   ```
3. Reduce prediction days (1-7 days is faster than 20-30)
4. Check your network connection
5. If consistently timing out, contact support@gprophet.com

#### Deep Analysis Hangs

**Problem**: Deep analysis task never completes

**Solutions**:
1. Deep analysis typically takes 30-120 seconds
2. Ensure you're polling the task status regularly:
   ```bash
   /gprophet task <task_id>  # Poll every 5 seconds
   ```
3. Maximum wait time is 5 minutes; if not completed by then, the task has failed
4. Check the error message for details
5. Try again with a different symbol

### Data Quality Issues

#### Prediction Confidence is Very Low

**Problem**: Prediction confidence is below 50%

**Causes**:
- Insufficient historical data
- High market volatility
- Unusual trading patterns
- Illiquid stocks

**Solutions**:
1. Try a longer prediction period (7-14 days instead of 1-3)
2. Use ensemble algorithm for more robust predictions
3. Combine with technical analysis for confirmation
4. Consider the market conditions (earnings, news, etc.)

#### Data Quality Score is Low

**Problem**: Data quality score in prediction response is below 70%

**Causes**:
- Missing historical data
- Data anomalies detected
- Insufficient trading history

**Solutions**:
1. Use a more established stock with longer trading history
2. Try a different time period
3. Check for recent corporate actions (splits, mergers)
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Integration Issues

#### MCP Tool Not Found

**Problem**: MCP tool is not available in your agent

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the skill is installed in your OpenClaw workspace
2. Check the tool name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Restart your agent or IDE
4. Verify your API key is configured

#### Tool Returns Empty Results

**Problem**: Tool executes but returns no data

**Solutions**:
1. Check the `success` field in the response
2. If `success: false`, check the `error.code` for details
3. Verify all required parameters are provided
4. Check your API key has sufficient permissions
