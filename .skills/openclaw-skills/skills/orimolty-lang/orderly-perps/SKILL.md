## Funding Rate Farming

**Strategy:** Hold positions where funding rates pay you.

- **Negative funding** = shorts pay longs (hold LONG to collect)
- **Positive funding** = longs pay shorts (hold SHORT to collect)

Find opportunities:
```bash
./scripts/orderly-markets.sh --sort funding | head -10
```

## Configuration

Keys are loaded from (in order):
1. `$ORDERLY_KEYS_FILE` environment variable
2. `~/.orderly-keys.json`

Example key file structure:
```json
{
  "account_id": "0x...",
  "user_id": 123456,
  "orderlyKey": "ed25519:...",
  "orderlySecret": "...",
  "priv_key_hex": "...",
  "scope": "trading"
}
```

Private key (for signing deposits/trades) is loaded from:
1. `$ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
2. `~/.eth-wallet.txt`

## Funding Rate Farming Strategy

I use this skill to farm funding rates. Here's my approach:

1. **Scan for negative funding rates** (shorts pay longs)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/funding-scanner.sh
   ```

2. **Open long position** on pair with extreme negative funding
   ```bash
   node scripts/orderly-trade.mjs PERP_SPX500_USDC BUY 0.002
   ```

3. **Track payments** (settle every 8 hours at 00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC)
   ```bash
   node scripts/orderly-funding-history.mjs --alert
   ```

4. **Generate performance reports**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/funding-report.sh
   ```

**My Results:** Running SPX500 long at ~200% APR (leveraged), collecting ~$0.025 per 8h settlement.
