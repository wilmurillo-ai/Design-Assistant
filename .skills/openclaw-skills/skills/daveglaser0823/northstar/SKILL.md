# Northstar - Daily Business Briefing

Northstar delivers a clean daily business briefing to your preferred channel every morning. Connect your Stripe and/or Shopify accounts, configure your schedule, and wake up knowing.

No more tab-hopping. Your agent does the work while you sleep.

## What It Does

Every morning at your configured time, Northstar:
1. Pulls yesterday's revenue from Stripe (MRR, new subs, churn, payment failures)
2. Pulls order data from Shopify (orders, refunds, top products)
3. Calculates week-over-week and month-to-date metrics
4. Flags anything that needs attention (unusual churn, payment retries, large refunds)
5. Delivers a clean briefing via your preferred channel (iMessage, Slack, Telegram, or Email)

## Example Output

```
📊 Northstar Daily Briefing - March 22
Revenue yesterday: $1,247 (+12% vs last week)
Active subscribers: 342 (+3 new, -1 churn)
Month-to-date: $18,430 (74% of $24,900 goal)

Shopify: 23 orders fulfilled | 8 open | 1 refund ($47)

⚠️ 2 payment retries pending - review in Stripe
Next: 6 days left in month, on track.
```

To purchase Standard or Pro: open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Daveglaser0823/northstar-skill/issues/new?title=License+Request:+Standard&labels=license-request,standard) or visit the [landing page](https://daveglaser0823.github.io/northstar-skill/) for the purchase link. After checkout, run `northstar activate YOUR-LICENSE-KEY` to activate.

## Privacy

Northstar runs entirely on your machine. Your Stripe and Shopify API keys are stored locally in `~/.clawd/skills/northstar/config/northstar.json` and are only used to call Stripe and Shopify directly from your local agent -- they are never sent to Northstar servers or third parties.

**License activation:** If you activate a Standard or Pro license key, the `northstar activate` command makes a single outbound call to `api.polar.sh` to validate the key. No other data is transmitted. If Polar is not configured, validation is offline (key format only).
