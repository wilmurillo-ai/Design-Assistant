# sovereign-security-auditor

Comprehensive code security audit skill covering OWASP Top 10, secrets detection, dependency vulnerabilities, and language-specific attack patterns.

## What It Does

When you install this skill, your AI agent gains the ability to perform systematic security audits on any codebase. It follows a structured methodology:

1. **Reconnaissance** -- Identifies the tech stack, architecture, and attack surface
2. **Systematic Scan** -- Checks code against all OWASP Top 10 categories
3. **Structured Report** -- Produces findings with severity, impact, and fix examples

## What It Detects

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Injection** | SQL injection, command injection, template injection, NoSQL injection |
| **Broken Auth** | Weak password hashing, missing rate limiting, insecure JWTs |
| **Data Exposure** | Hardcoded secrets, API keys in code, PII in logs |
| **XXE** | Unsafe XML parsers, external entity processing |
| **Broken Access** | Missing auth middleware, IDOR, permissive CORS |
| **Misconfig** | Debug mode in production, default credentials, missing headers |
| **XSS** | Reflected, stored, and DOM-based cross-site scripting |
| **Deserialization** | Unsafe pickle, YAML load, ObjectInputStream |
| **Vulnerable Deps** | Outdated packages, unpinned versions, known CVEs |
| **Logging Gaps** | Missing audit trails, sensitive data in logs |

## Supported Languages

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- Java
- SQL

## Severity Levels

- **Critical** -- Actively exploitable, immediate fix required
- **High** -- Exploitable with effort, fix within 24 hours
- **Medium** -- Conditional exploit, fix within 1 week
- **Low** -- Minor risk, fix within 1 month
- **Info** -- Best practice recommendation

## Install

```bash
clawhub install sovereign-security-auditor
```

## Usage

After installation, ask your agent to audit code:

```
Audit this Express.js application for security vulnerabilities.
```

```
Review this pull request for security issues before merge.
```

```
Check this Python API for injection vulnerabilities and secrets exposure.
```

The agent will produce a structured report with findings grouped by severity, each including the vulnerable code, impact assessment, and a concrete fix with code example.
