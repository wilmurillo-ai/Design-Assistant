# Podwise CLI Reference

Use the `podwise` command to search episodes, process media, retrieve AI artifacts, manage subscriptions, browse history, and ask questions across podcast transcripts.

Check that the CLI is installed and configured before running any command:

```bash
podwise --help
podwise config show
```

Every command supports `--help` for full flag details. Add `--json` for machine-readable output when results will be parsed by another step.

## Commands

### search

Find episodes or podcasts by keyword or title.

```bash
# Search episodes
podwise search episode "AI agents" --limit 10 --json
podwise search episode "Hard Fork" --limit 5 --json

# Search podcasts by name
podwise search podcast "Lex Fridman" --limit 5 --json
podwise search podcast "All-In" --limit 5 --json
```

Use `search episode` when the user wants a list of matching episodes to browse.
Use `search podcast` when the user is looking for a show by name or wants candidates to subscribe to.
Use `ask` — not `search` — when the user wants a synthesized answer from transcript content.

---

### popular

Discover what is currently trending across Podwise.

```bash
podwise popular --json
```

---

### list

Browse new episodes and followed podcasts.

```bash
# New episodes from followed podcasts — last N days
podwise list episodes --json --latest 7
podwise list episodes --json --latest 30

# New episodes by specific date
podwise list episodes --json --date today
podwise list episodes --json --date yesterday
podwise list episodes --json --date 2026-03-01

# Followed podcasts with recent updates
podwise list podcasts --json
podwise list podcasts --json --date today
podwise list podcasts --json --latest 14
```

---

### drill

List recent episodes for a specific podcast by its Podwise URL.

```bash
podwise drill https://podwise.ai/dashboard/podcasts/{id} --json
podwise drill https://podwise.ai/dashboard/podcasts/{id} --latest 7 --json
```

Use `drill` when the user wants to explore a specific show's back catalogue rather than their full followed feed.

---

### follow / unfollow

Manage podcast subscriptions. Both commands are idempotent.

```bash
podwise follow https://podwise.ai/dashboard/podcasts/{id}
podwise unfollow https://podwise.ai/dashboard/podcasts/{id}
```

---

### history

Browse the user's listening and reading activity. Results are sorted by most recent first.

```bash
# Episodes the user has read (viewed in Podwise)
podwise history read --json
podwise history read --json --limit 20

# Episodes the user has listened to
podwise history listened --json
podwise history listened --json --limit 20
```

---

### ask

Ask a question and get a transcript-grounded answer synthesized across Podwise's corpus.

```bash
podwise ask "the future of AI agents"
podwise ask "how do founders think about pricing?" --sources
podwise ask "what do podcasts say about longevity and sleep?"
```

`--sources` appends source excerpts and episode links. Use it when the user wants to trace claims back to specific episodes.

Allow up to 60 seconds — `ask` searches transcripts and generates a synthesis. Do not cancel early.

Do not use `ask` to locate episodes by keyword — use `search episode` for that.

---

### process

Submit an episode, video, or local file for AI processing.

```bash
# Podwise episode URL
podwise process https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/7360326

# YouTube
podwise process https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0-Gn_Bxf8s
podwise process https://youtu.be/d0-Gn_Bxf8s

# Xiaoyuzhou
podwise process https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/abc123

# Local audio or video file
podwise process ./interview.mp3
podwise process ./meeting.wav --title "Product Review Meeting"
podwise process ./demo.mp4 --title "Launch Demo" --hotwords "Podwise,LLM,ASR"
```

Supported local file extensions: `.mp3 .wav .m4a .mp4 .m4v .mov .webm`

`process` waits for completion before exiting. The output includes the resolved Podwise episode URL — use that URL for all subsequent `get` commands.

**`process` consumes quota/credits. Always confirm with the user before running it**, regardless of input type.

---

### get

Retrieve AI-generated artifacts for a processed episode.

```bash
podwise get summary <episode-url>
podwise get transcript <episode-url>
podwise get chapters <episode-url>
podwise get highlights <episode-url>
podwise get qa <episode-url>
podwise get mindmap <episode-url>
podwise get keywords <episode-url>
```

Transcript format options:

```bash
podwise get transcript <episode-url>               # plain text (default)
podwise get transcript <episode-url> --format srt  # SubRip
podwise get transcript <episode-url> --format vtt  # WebVTT
```

`get` accepts only a Podwise episode URL — never a YouTube, Xiaoyuzhou, or local file path. Run `process` on external sources first, then use the resulting Podwise URL with `get`.

---

### translate

Request translation of an episode's transcript and summary into a target language, then wait for completion.

```bash
podwise translate <episode-url> --lang Chinese
```

Supported languages: `Chinese`, `Traditional-Chinese`, `English`, `Japanese`, `Korean`

---

### export

Export AI-generated episode content to external services.

```bash
# Export to Notion
podwise export notion <episode-url>
podwise export notion <episode-url> --lang Chinese

# Export to Readwise Reader
podwise export readwise <episode-url>
podwise export readwise <episode-url> --location later
podwise export readwise <episode-url> --lang Chinese

# Export to Obsidian
podwise export obsidian <episode-url>
podwise export obsidian <episode-url> --lang Chinese
podwise export obsidian <episode-url> --folder Podcasts/2026

# Export to a local file
podwise export markdown <episode-url>
podwise export markdown <episode-url> --lang Chinese
```

## Common Failure Cases

- **`get` returns "not processed"**: Run `podwise process <url>` first (confirm with user — quota is consumed).
- **`get` passed a non-Podwise URL**: `get` only accepts Podwise episode URLs. Run `process` on external URLs first.
- **Unsupported local file extension**: Supported formats are `.mp3 .wav .m4a .mp4 .m4v .mov .webm`.
- **`ask` returns a plan-limit error**: Report it directly. Do not fabricate an answer.
- **`process` runs without confirmation**: Always wrong — `process` consumes quota.
