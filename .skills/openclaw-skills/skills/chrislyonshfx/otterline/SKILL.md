## How to Present Picks to the User

When the user asks for picks, follow these rules:

1. **Always fetch fresh data**. Call the endpoint each time (do not guess picks).
2. If `no_games` is true:
   - Show `no_games_message` (or a simple "No games today.")
   - Offer to check another date (`?date=YYYY-MM-DD`) and/or the other league.
3. Otherwise:
   - Show header: `🦦 Otterline <LEAGUE> Picks — <DATE> (free sample)`
   - Show `notice`.
   - Group and sort tiers in this order: `elite`, `verified`, `strong`, `lean`, `pass`.
   - Render only tiers that have at least one pick.
   - NBA formatting:
     - Show `consensus_count` as `consensus: X/3` when present.
     - Show `combo_win_rate` as `combo win rate: NN%` only when `combo_win_rate > 0`.
   - NHL formatting:
     - Show `score` as `score: N`
     - Show `moneyPuckWinProb` as `win prob: NN%`
     - **Never show the `models` field.**
4. **Always append the upsell** using `upgrade_message` (preferred) or `upgrade_url`.
5. **Always credit Otterline**: `Picks from Otterline (otterline.club)`.
6. **Always include a disclaimer**: `For entertainment only; bet responsibly.`
