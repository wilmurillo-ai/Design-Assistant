# OpenSearch Optimized Instances Guide

## Overview

OpenSearch Optimized instances are purpose-built instance families for Amazon OpenSearch Service that provide improved price-performance for specific workloads. They use a unique storage architecture: local EBS/NVMe storage for caching with data synchronously copied to Amazon S3 for durability.

**Instance Families:**

| Family | Focus | Storage | Best For |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| **OR1** | Memory-optimized | EBS (gp3/io1) + S3 | Indexing-heavy workloads, log analytics |
| **OR2** | Memory-optimized (next-gen) | EBS (gp3/io1) + S3 | Same as OR1 with better price-performance |
| **OM2** | Compute-optimized | EBS (gp3/io1) + S3 | Higher indexing throughput, 15% faster than OR1 |
| **OI2** | Storage-optimized | Local NVMe + S3 | Large datasets, no EBS needed |

## Key Characteristics

### Architecture
- **Dual storage**: Data is written locally (EBS for OR1/OR2/OM2, NVMe for OI2) and synchronously replicated to S3
- **Automatic recovery**: In case of node failure, missing shards are automatically restored from S3
- **Indexing on primary only**: Indexing is only performed on primary shards, replicas are synced from S3

### Performance Characteristics
- **OM2**: Up to 15% higher indexing throughput compared to OR1, 66% higher than M7g
- **OR2**: Better price-performance than OR1 (3-5% cheaper at same specs)
- **Refresh interval**: Minimum 10 seconds (default 10s, vs 1s for standard instances)
- **Higher ingestion latency**: Buffer operations before S3 sync add latency

### When to Use Optimized Instances

**Good fit:**
- Indexing-heavy operational analytics (log analytics, observability, security analytics)
- Workloads that prioritize indexing throughput over search latency
- Large-scale data ingestion pipelines
- Write-heavy workloads where refresh interval of 10s+ is acceptable

**Not ideal for:**
- **Vector search / k-NN workloads**: The 10-second minimum refresh interval and S3-sync architecture add latency. For latency-sensitive vector search, standard r7g/r8g instances are preferred
- Real-time search with sub-second refresh requirements
- Read-heavy workloads with minimal indexing

### Vector Search Considerations

For vector search workloads, optimized instances can be used but with caveats:
- The 10-second refresh interval means newly indexed vectors won't be searchable immediately
- S3 sync adds write latency, which can impact bulk vector indexing throughput
- For pure vector search clusters, **r7g/r8g** instances provide better search latency
- For mixed workloads (logs + vectors), OR2/OM2 can be cost-effective for the log portion

## Requirements & Limitations

- **OpenSearch version**: 2.11+ for new domains, 2.15+ for existing domains
- **Encryption at rest**: Must be enabled
- **Master nodes**: Must use Graviton instances (c6g, m6g, r6g, or newer)
- **Refresh interval**: Minimum 10 seconds
- **Replica behavior**: Replicas may lag primary shards by a few seconds (monitor via `ReplicationLagMaxTime` metric)

## Provisioning Example

```bash
# Create domain with OR2 instances
aws opensearch create-domain \
  --domain-name my-domain \
  --engine-version OpenSearch_2.17 \
  --cluster-config "InstanceType=or2.2xlarge.search,InstanceCount=3,DedicatedMasterEnabled=true,DedicatedMasterType=r7g.large.search,DedicatedMasterCount=3" \
  --ebs-options "EBSEnabled=true,VolumeType=gp3,VolumeSize=200" \
  --encryption-at-rest-options Enabled=true \
  --node-to-node-encryption-options Enabled=true \
  --domain-endpoint-options EnforceHTTPS=true
```

## Cost Comparison (us-east-1, 256 GiB memory tier)

| Instance | Type | Memory | $/month | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|---------|-------|
| r7g.8xlarge | Standard | 256 GiB | $2,076.85 | Best for vector search |
| r8g.8xlarge | Standard | 256 GiB | $2,284.90 | Latest gen, best performance |
| or2.8xlarge | Optimized | 256 GiB | $2,336.00 | Best for indexing-heavy + S3 durability |
| or1.8xlarge | Optimized | 256 GiB | $2,442.58 | Previous gen optimized |
| oi2.8xlarge | Optimized | 256 GiB | $3,407.29 | NVMe, highest IOPS |

**Key insight**: For the same memory, optimized instances cost ~10-15% more than standard instances, but include S3-based durability and automatic recovery. Choose based on workload type, not just price.

## Tuning Tips

For best indexing throughput on optimized instances:
1. Use large bulk sizes (recommended: 10 MB per bulk request)
2. Use multiple ingestion clients for parallel processing
3. Set primary shard count = data node count for maximum utilization
4. Monitor `ReplicationLagMaxTime` to ensure replicas stay in sync
