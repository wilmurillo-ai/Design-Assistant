# Security Documentation

## Overview

ClawVault is a security-focused AI protection system that operates as a local HTTP proxy to inspect and protect AI agent traffic. This document explains the security model, potential risks, and best practices for safe deployment.

## Design Intent — Why Several Defaults Look Permissive

ClawVault is a **man-in-the-middle (MITM) inspection proxy for AI traffic**. To do its job, it necessarily exhibits behaviors that automated security scanners flag as high-risk. Every one of these is intentional. This section documents them up-front so there is no ambiguity between "intentional capability" and "bug."

| Behavior | Why it's required | How to constrain it |
|---|---|---|
| `ssl_verify: false` in default config | Decrypts HTTPS so detectors can scan request/response bodies. Without this, ClawVault cannot see the AI traffic it is meant to protect. | MITM only applies to hosts listed in `proxy.intercept_hosts`. Non-AI traffic passes through untouched. Limit the list if you only want specific providers inspected. |
| Dashboard has no authentication by default | Default bind is `127.0.0.1` (localhost only); anyone with a shell on the machine already has more access than the dashboard exposes. | **Never** start with `--dashboard-host 0.0.0.0` on untrusted networks. Use SSH port-forwarding for remote viewing. |
| The skill sees your API keys and prompts | API keys travel inside the HTTPS requests being inspected. A proxy that inspects requests will see them. | All traffic stays on `localhost`. Nothing is uploaded. Audit logs in `~/.ClawVault/audit.db` are local-only. |
| Installer writes `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` into `openclaw-gateway.service` | Required for OpenClaw to route traffic through ClawVault. Without this, the proxy is installed but inert. | Pass `--no-proxy` at install time to skip this step — you can wire it up manually later. The modification is only applied if the unit file already exists. |
| Installs from GitHub, tag-pinned by default; main branch as fallback only | No PyPI distribution exists yet. Default install pins to `@v{VERSION}` for reproducibility; falls back to `main` only if that tag cannot be resolved upstream. | To further harden, edit the pip URL to pin to a specific commit SHA, or run in a disposable VM. See "Package Sources" below. |

If any of these trade-offs are unacceptable for your threat model, **do not install this skill.**

## How ClawVault Works

### Proxy Architecture

ClawVault runs as a **local HTTP proxy** that intercepts traffic between AI agents and LLM providers:

```
AI Agent → ClawVault Proxy (localhost:8765) → LLM Provider APIs
                    ↓
            Detection Engine
                    ↓
            Dashboard (localhost:8766)
```

**What This Means:**
- All API requests pass through ClawVault for inspection
- ClawVault can see request/response content including API keys
- This is intentional and necessary for threat detection
- The proxy runs locally on your machine, not on external servers

### SSL/TLS Verification

**Default Behavior:**
- ClawVault's default configuration sets `ssl_verify: false` for proxied connections
- This is required for the proxy to inspect HTTPS traffic (MITM-style interception)

**Security Implications:**
- Disabling SSL verification allows ClawVault to decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic
- This is necessary for detecting threats in API requests/responses
- Traffic between your machine and LLM providers is still encrypted
- The decryption happens locally on your machine, not in transit

**Recommendation:**
- Only use ClawVault on trusted networks
- The proxy is designed for local development/testing
- For production, consider using ClawVault's detection rules without the proxy

## Dashboard Security

### Default Configuration (Secure)

```bash
# Dashboard binds to localhost only
clawvault start
# Access: http://127.0.0.1:8766 (local machine only)
```

**This is the recommended configuration** for most users.

### Remote Access Configuration (Risky)

```bash
# Dashboard accessible from any IP
clawvault start --dashboard-host 0.0.0.0
# Access: http://<your-ip>:8766 (anyone on network can access)
```

**⚠️ Security Risks:**
- Dashboard shows sensitive detection data (API keys, PII, etc.)
- No authentication by default
- Anyone on your network can view the dashboard
- Potential data exposure if misconfigured

**When to Use Remote Access:**
- Only in trusted, isolated networks
- Behind a firewall with strict access controls
- For temporary debugging/demonstration purposes

**Production Recommendations:**
1. Keep dashboard on localhost (127.0.0.1)
2. Use SSH tunneling for remote access:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 8766:localhost:8766 user@remote-server
   ```
3. Or use a reverse proxy with authentication (nginx + basic auth)
4. Never expose dashboard to public internet without authentication

## Permissions Explained

The skill requires these permissions:

### `execute_command`
- **Purpose:** Create a Python venv in `~/.clawvault-env/`, run `pip install git+https://github.com/tophant-ai/ClawVault.git` into that venv, and start/stop the proxy + dashboard services. On OpenClaw systems the installer also writes `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables into `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service` so the gateway routes AI traffic through ClawVault.
- **Risk:** Can execute arbitrary commands on your system; modifies one OpenClaw unit file when present.
- **Mitigation:** All commands are explicit in `clawvault_manager.py`. Pass `--no-proxy` to skip the systemd modification, or `--no-start` to skip launching services. No command runs without being visible in `clawvault_manager.py:install()`.

### `write_files`
- **Purpose:** Create configuration files in `~/.ClawVault/`
- **Risk:** Can write to your home directory
- **Mitigation:** Skill only writes to dedicated ClawVault config directory

### `read_files`
- **Purpose:** Read existing ClawVault configuration
- **Risk:** Can read files on your system
- **Mitigation:** Skill only reads from `~/.ClawVault/` directory

### `network`
- **Purpose:** Download ClawVault package, proxy API traffic, call local dashboard API
- **Risk:** Can make network requests
- **Mitigation:** Network access is essential for proxy functionality; all traffic is logged

## Data Handling

### What Data ClawVault Sees

ClawVault inspects:
- API requests to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- API responses from LLM providers
- API keys and authentication tokens (in request headers)
- User prompts and AI responses
- Potentially sensitive data (PII, credentials) in prompts/responses

### Where Data Is Stored

- **Audit logs:** `~/.ClawVault/audit.db` (SQLite database)
- **Detection logs:** `~/.ClawVault/logs/detection.log`
- **Configuration:** `~/.ClawVault/config.yaml`

### Data Retention

- Audit logs are stored indefinitely by default
- You can configure retention policies in `config.yaml`
- To clear logs: `rm ~/.ClawVault/audit.db`

### Data Privacy

- All data stays on your local machine
- ClawVault does not send data to external servers (except when proxying to LLM providers)
- No telemetry or analytics are collected
- You control all data through local configuration files

## Installation Security

### Package Sources

The skill installs ClawVault **exclusively from the upstream GitHub repository**. There is currently no PyPI distribution.

1. **Primary (tag-pinned):** `pip install git+https://github.com/tophant-ai/ClawVault.git@v{VERSION}` — the installer tags its own release version and pins to that git tag by default, giving you a reproducible install.
2. **Fallback (only if the tag is unavailable on the upstream repo):** `pip install git+https://github.com/tophant-ai/ClawVault.git` (tracks `main`)

The installer does **not** perform:
- Version pinning by default (main-branch install)
- Checksum verification
- Signature verification
- Dependency-graph auditing

**Supply-chain risk:** Installing from the upstream main branch means that **a compromise of the `tophant-ai/ClawVault` repository would propagate to all future installs**. This is a deliberate design trade-off to ship fixes quickly before PyPI distribution is set up.

**How to reduce supply-chain exposure:**
1. Review the repository before installing: https://github.com/tophant-ai/ClawVault
2. Check out a specific commit/tag locally and point `pip` at that path instead
3. Run `./venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/tophant-ai/ClawVault.git@<sha>` with an audited commit SHA
4. Run the installer inside a disposable VM or container
5. Subscribe to the repo's security advisories on GitHub

### Installation Process

What happens, in order, during `install --mode quick`:

1. Verifies Python version (≥ 3.10)
2. Creates a **dedicated virtual environment** at `~/.clawvault-env/` (isolates ClawVault from system Python — nothing is installed globally)
3. Runs `pip install git+https://github.com/tophant-ai/ClawVault.git@v{VERSION}` inside that venv (tag-pinned; falls back to main branch only if the tag is unavailable)
4. Copies `config.example.yaml` from the installed package to `~/.ClawVault/config.yaml`; if the template is unavailable, generates a complete 11-section default config
5. If `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service` exists, injects `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`/`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` into it so OpenClaw routes AI traffic through ClawVault. Skipped if `--no-proxy` is passed or if the service file is absent.
6. Launches the proxy (port 8765) and dashboard (port 8766) via `subprocess.Popen`. Skipped if `--no-start` is passed.

Everything the skill touches lives under three predictable paths:
- `~/.clawvault-env/` — the Python venv
- `~/.ClawVault/` — config, audit DB, logs, certs, state
- `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service` — **modified only if it already exists**

## Threat Model

### What ClawVault Protects Against

✅ **Prompt injection attacks** - Detects attempts to manipulate AI behavior
✅ **Data leakage** - Identifies PII, credentials, API keys in prompts/responses
✅ **Dangerous commands** - Flags risky shell commands in AI outputs
✅ **Jailbreak attempts** - Detects attempts to bypass AI safety measures

### What ClawVault Does NOT Protect Against

❌ **Malicious ClawVault package** - If the upstream package is compromised, the skill will install it
❌ **Local system compromise** - If your machine is compromised, ClawVault data can be accessed
❌ **Network attacks** - ClawVault does not protect against network-level attacks
❌ **Supply chain attacks** - No verification of package integrity during installation

## Best Practices

### For Development/Testing

```bash
# Safe configuration for local development
clawvault start --dashboard-host 127.0.0.1 --mode interactive

# Review detection logs regularly
tail -f ~/.ClawVault/logs/detection.log

# Test with non-sensitive data first
clawvault test --category all
```

### For Production

```bash
# Use strict mode for automated blocking
clawvault start --mode strict

# Keep dashboard local, use SSH tunnel for remote access
ssh -L 8766:localhost:8766 user@server

# Configure audit retention
# Edit ~/.ClawVault/config.yaml:
audit:
  enabled: true
  retention_days: 30
```

### For Sensitive Environments

1. **Review the source code** before installation
2. **Run in isolated environment** (VM, container)
3. **Use firewall rules** to restrict network access
4. **Rotate API keys** regularly
5. **Monitor audit logs** for suspicious activity
6. **Disable dashboard** if not needed: `--no-dashboard`
