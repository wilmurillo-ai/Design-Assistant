# Intent Framed Agent

## Install

```bash
npx skills add pskoett/pskoett-ai-skills
```

```bash
npx skills add pskoett/pskoett-ai-skills/skills/intent-framed-agent
```

## Purpose

This skill turns implicit intent into an explicit, trackable artifact at the
moment execution starts. It creates a lightweight intent contract, watches for
scope drift while work is in progress, and closes each intent with a short
resolution record.

## Scope (Important)

Use this skill for coding tasks only. It is designed for implementation work
that changes executable code.

Do not use it for general-agent activities such as:
- broad research
- planning-only conversations
- documentation-only work
- operational/admin tasks with no coding implementation

For trivial edits (for example, simple renames or typo fixes), skip the full
intent frame.

## Trigger

Activate at the planning-to-execution transition for non-trivial coding work.

Common cues:
- User says: "go ahead", "implement this", "let's start building"
- Agent is about to move from discussion into code changes

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Intent Capture

At execution start, emit:

```markdown
## Intent Frame #N

**Outcome:** [One sentence. What does done look like?]
**Approach:** [How we will implement it. Key decisions.]
**Constraints:** [Out-of-scope boundaries.]
**Success criteria:** [How we verify completion.]
**Estimated complexity:** [Small / Medium / Large]
```

Rules:
- Keep each field to 1-2 sentences.
- Ask for confirmation before coding:
  - `Does this capture what we are doing? Anything to adjust before I start?`
- Do not proceed until the user confirms or adjusts.

### Phase 2: Intent Monitor

During execution, monitor for drift at natural boundaries:
- before touching a new area/file
- before starting a new logical work unit
- when current action feels tangential

Drift examples:
- work outside stated scope
- approach changes with no explicit pivot
- new features/refactors outside constraints
- solving a different problem than the stated outcome

When detected, emit:

```markdown
## Intent Check #N

This looks like it may be moving outside the stated intent.

**Stated outcome:** [From active frame]
**Current action:** [What is happening]
**Question:** Is this a deliberate pivot or accidental scope creep?
```

If pivot is intentional, update the active intent frame and continue. If not,
return to the original scope.

### Phase 3: Intent Resolution

When work under the active intent ends, emit:

```markdown
## Intent Resolution #N

**Outcome:** [Fulfilled / Partially fulfilled / Pivoted / Abandoned]
**What was delivered:** [Brief actual output]
**Pivots:** [Any acknowledged changes, or None]
**Open items:** [Remaining in-scope items, or None]
```

Resolution is preferred but optional if the session ends abruptly.

## Multi-Intent Sessions

One session can contain multiple intent frames.

Rules:
1. Resolve current intent before opening the next.
2. If user changes direction mid-task, resolve current intent as
   `Abandoned` or `Pivoted`, then open a new frame.
3. Drift checks always target the currently active frame.
4. Number frames sequentially within the session (`#1`, `#2`, ...).
5. Constraints do not carry forward unless explicitly restated.

## Entire CLI Integration

Entire CLI: https://github.com/entireio/cli

When tool access is available, detect Entire at activation:

```bash
entire status 2>/dev/null
```

- If it succeeds, mention that intent records will be captured in the session
  transcript on the checkpoint branch. This enables `learning-aggregator --deep`
  to later mine intent frames and drift events for cross-session scope-drift
  patterns.
- If unavailable/failing, continue silently. Do not block execution and do not
  nag about installation.

Copilot/chat fallback:
- If command execution is unavailable, skip detection and continue with the
  same intent workflow in chat output.

### How intent frames become learning signals

Each Intent Frame and Intent Check you emit is captured verbatim in Entire's
session transcript. At cadence, `learning-aggregator --deep` reads those
transcripts and extracts:

- Frames that were resolved as `Abandoned` or `Pivoted` → potential planning
  gaps
- Drift signals that repeatedly fire in similar contexts → potential scope
  definition issues
- Constraint violations detected by drift checks → patterns for promotion to
  project instruction files

You do not need to do anything special for this — the intent blocks are
structured (`## Intent Frame #N`, `## Intent Check`, `## Intent Resolution`),
which makes them parseable from the transcript.

## Guardrails

- Keep it lightweight; avoid long prose.
- Do not over-trigger on trivial tasks.
- Do not interrupt on every small step.
- Treat acknowledged pivots as valid.
- Preserve exact structured block headers/fields for parseability.

## Interoperability with Other Skills

Use this skill as the front-door alignment layer for non-trivial coding work:
1. `plan-interview` (optional, for requirement shaping)
2. `intent-framed-agent` (execution contract + scope drift monitoring)
3. `context-surfing` (context quality monitoring — runs concurrently with intent-framed-agent during execution)
4. `simplify-and-harden` (post-completion quality/security pass)
5. `self-improvement` (capture recurring patterns and promote durable rules)

### Relationship with context-surfing

Both skills are live during execution. They monitor different failure modes:

- **intent-framed-agent** monitors *scope* drift — is the agent doing the right
  thing? It fires structured Intent Checks when work moves outside the stated
  outcome.
- **context-surfing** monitors *context quality* drift — is the agent still
  capable of doing it well? It fires when the agent's own coherence degrades
  (hallucination, contradiction, hedging).

They are complementary, not redundant. An agent can be perfectly on-scope while
its context quality degrades. Conversely, scope drift can happen with perfect
context quality. Intent Checks continue firing alongside context-surfing's wave
monitoring.

**Precedence rule:** If both skills fire simultaneously (an Intent Check and a
context-surfing drift exit at the same time), the drift exit takes precedence.
Degraded context makes scope checks unreliable — resolve the context issue
first, then resume scope monitoring in the next session.

**Cadence separation:** Intent Checks fire at scope boundaries — before
touching a new area/file, before starting a new logical work unit, when the
current action feels tangential. Context-surfing's pre-commit anchor check
fires at side-effecting-action moments — specific tool calls, writes,
commits, commit-level output. Don't run both in the same beat: if an Intent
Check has just fired and resolved cleanly, the next side-effecting action
inside the same work unit doesn't need a fresh anchor check — you already
re-grounded.

### What this skill produces

- **Intent frame artifact** — consumed by context-surfing as part of the wave
  anchor and copied verbatim into handoff files on drift exit.
- **Intent resolution** — signals task completion, which triggers
  simplify-and-harden.
- **Drift observations** — scope drift patterns can be logged to
  self-improvement as learnings if they recur.
