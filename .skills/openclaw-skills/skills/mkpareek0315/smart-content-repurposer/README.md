# client-manager

**The only CRM a freelancer needs — runs entirely from chat.**

Track clients, leads, projects, time, invoices, proposals, and earnings. All from your OpenClaw agent. No spreadsheets. No $50/month CRM subscriptions. Just chat.

## Why This Exists

Freelancers juggle 5-7 disconnected tools: email, spreadsheets, invoicing software, project management, time trackers. Each handles one function, none share data. You become the manual integration layer.

client-manager replaces all of them with one skill that lives in your OpenClaw chat.

**Replaces:** Notion CRM + FreshBooks + Toggl + Pipedrive + Google Sheets
**Cost of those tools:** $50-150/month
**Cost of client-manager:** Free. Forever.
