# TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Test-Driven Development: define expected behavior first, then make it pass with implementation.

## Topics

| Topic | Description | Guide |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| cycle | Red→Green→Refactor cycle, bug-fix TDD, anti-patterns | [cycle.md](./cycle.md) |
| run | Test execution workflow (environment detection→impact scope→execution→result reporting) | [run.md](./run.md) |
| test-strategies | Boundary value·equivalence partitioning·decision table·error guessing·path coverage | [test-strategies.md](./test-strategies.md) |

## Quick Reference

### TDD Cycle
Define expected behavior → natural failure → implement → pass → refactor.
See [cycle.md](./cycle.md).

### Test Execution
Environment detection → impact scope → execution (unit→integration→e2e) → result reporting.
See [run.md](./run.md).

### Test Design Techniques
Decide which test cases to write (boundary value, equivalence partitioning, etc.).
See [test-strategies.md](./test-strategies.md).
