# Send Video Message

Send the user a video message where an AI avatar speaks your words — lip-synced with natural motion. Use this for async updates, code review walkthroughs, incident summaries, or anything that's better explained with a face than a wall of text.

## Privacy & Data Handling

- **Runway API**: Only data you explicitly pass (spoken text, avatar image) is sent to Runway ([dev.runwayml.com](https://dev.runwayml.com)). Nothing is uploaded automatically. Custom avatars can be deleted anytime via `DELETE /v1/avatars/{id}`.
- **Output**: Generated videos are saved to `/tmp` and sent via `MEDIA:` for OpenClaw to auto-attach.

## Setup

### Get a Runway API Key

1. Go to [dev.runwayml.com](https://dev.runwayml.com)
2. Create an account and get an API key
3. Set it: `export RUNWAY_API_SECRET=your_key`

## One-Time Setup: Create Your Avatar

Before generating videos, create a **custom** avatar (face image + Runway). **You only need to do this once** — the avatar ID is saved and reused for all future videos.

The voice is chosen later in `generate_video.py`, not at avatar creation.

### Which face to use — follow this order

1. **Default (no user preference):** Use **Openclaw Lobster 2** as `referenceImage` via `setup_avatar.py --image-url` (URL below). **Do not** use Runway’s built-in preset avatars (`game-character`, `cat-character`, etc.) as the first choice — those are only for the **fallback** in step 3.
2. **User asked for a look:** Pick **another image from the list** below, use an **image URL they gave you**, **or** run `setup_avatar.py --description "..."` to **generate a face from text** (slower; uses Runway text-to-image).
3. **Fallback — urgent or you’re out of time:** Skip `setup_avatar` and call `generate_video.py` with **`--preset-id "game-character"`** (or another Runway preset ID from the fallback list below). Faster, less distinctive than Lobster / list images.

**Check first:** If `~/.openclaw/runway-avatar.json` already has an `avatar_id` (or you know one from a prior run), **reuse it** and skip to **Generate a Video Message**.

### Step 1: Pick a face image (for custom avatar)

Use **Openclaw Lobster 2** unless the user wants something else from this list (or their own URL):

- **Openclaw Lobster 2 (default)**: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/openclaw-lobster2.jpg`
- Openclaw Lobster 1: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/openclaw-lobster1.jpg`
- Cat: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/cat.png`
- Alien man, candy texture: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/alien-man-candy-texture.jpg`
- Alien woman, candy texture: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/alien-woman-candy-texture.jpg`
- Old man, long beard, game style: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/old-man-long-beard-game-style.png`
- Blond guy, blue sweater: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/blond-guy-blue-sweater.png`
- Man, 3D animation: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/man-3d-animation-style.png`
- Girl in airport, 3D: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/3d-animated-girl-in-airport.png`
- White furry monster: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/white-furry-monster.png`
- Superstar young woman: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/woman-music-superstar.png`

**Generate from text** (when the user asks for a custom look and no URL fits) — `setup_avatar.py --description "..."`. The image should be **a character facing the camera directly, head and shoulders, centered**. Be bold and creative:
- **Warm / friendly** → soft 3D animation, Pixar-style, watercolor
- **Sharp / professional** → clean illustration, stylized portrait, low-poly
- **Chaotic / playful** → candy texture, claymation, puppet, pop art
- **Cute / wholesome** → chibi, plush toy, animal character, kawaii

### Step 2: Create the avatar

**Default — Openclaw Lobster 2:**

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/setup_avatar.py \
  --name "Mochi" \
  --image-url "https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/openclaw-lobster2.jpg"
```

**Another character from the list above** — same command as Lobster 2, only change `--image-url` to that preset’s URL.

**Text description (generates the image)** — when the user wants a custom generated look:

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/setup_avatar.py \
  --name "Mochi" \
  --description "A cute fluffy white cartoon creature with large expressive eyes, looking directly at the viewer, 3D animation style, head and shoulders, neutral background"
```

**With your own image URL:**

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/setup_avatar.py \
  --name "Mochi" \
  --image-url "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
```

The setup script prints the avatar ID and saves it to `~/.openclaw/runway-avatar.json`. Future `generate_video.py` calls use it automatically. **Save the avatar ID — reuse it for all videos. Do NOT create a new avatar each time.**

## Generate a Video Message

Write what you want to say, pick a voice that matches your avatar image, and the avatar will speak it with lip-synced animation. **Always pass `--voice`** — choose one that fits the character's appearance (e.g. a female avatar should use a female voice, an authoritative-looking character should use a deeper voice).

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py \
  --text "Hey Alex — quick update on the deploy. Everything went through, all tests passing. The memory fix from your PR cut p99 latency by 40 percent. Nice work." \
  --voice "Maya"
```

Do **not** pass `--preset-id` when a **custom** avatar is already saved or you pass `--avatar-id` — that is the normal path after Lobster 2 / list / text setup.

### Cropping for mobile & Telegram

Runway’s avatar video is **wide** (16:9). On phones that can look **squished or awkward**. Crop it to match the target app:

| Target | Flag | Resolution | Ratio |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Telegram** | `--square` | 1080×1080 | 1:1 |
| **Other mobile** (WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.) | `--vertical` | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |

Both flags scale the frame up to cover the target area, then **center-crop**. They are mutually exclusive — pick one. Env vars work too: `SEND_VIDEO_MESSAGE_SQUARE=1` or `SEND_VIDEO_MESSAGE_VERTICAL=1`.

Requires **`ffmpeg`** on the machine that runs the script (`brew install ffmpeg` on macOS).

**Telegram** (square):

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py \
  --text "Quick update — deploy is green, all tests passed." \
  --voice "Maya" \
  --square
```

**WhatsApp / iMessage / other mobile** (vertical):

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py \
  --text "Quick update — deploy is green, all tests passed." \
  --voice "Maya" \
  --vertical
```

### Available TTS voices

Pass `--voice <name>` to `generate_video.py` (default: `Maya`):

| ID | Gender | Style | Pitch |
|----|--------|-------|-------|
| `Maya` | Woman | Upbeat | Higher |
| `Arjun` | Man | Clear | Middle |
| `Serene` | Woman | Calm | Middle |
| `Bernard` | Man | Authoritative | Lower |
| `Billy` | Man | Casual | Middle |
| `Mark` | Man | Neutral | Middle |
| `Clint` | Man | Gravelly | Lower |
| `Mabel` | Woman | Warm | Middle |
| `Chad` | Man | Energetic | Middle |
| `Leslie` | Woman | Friendly | Middle |
| `Eleanor` | Woman | Mature | Middle |
| `Elias` | Man | Smooth | Lower-middle |
| `Elliot` | Man | Even | Middle |
| `Noah` | Man | Relaxed | Lower-middle |
| `Rachel` | Woman | Clear | Middle |
| `James` | Man | Firm | Lower |
| `Katie` | Woman | Bright | Higher |
| `Tom` | Man | Casual | Middle |
| `Wanda` | Woman | Warm | Middle |
| `Benjamin` | Man | Professional | Lower-middle |

With a specific avatar ID (overrides saved default; still **no** `--preset-id`):

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py --text "Morning standup recap..." --avatar-id "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" --voice "Maya"
```

### Fallback — Runway preset avatar (only if no time)

Use **only** when you **cannot** run `setup_avatar` (deadline, user waiting, etc.). Prefer **`game-character`** as the preset. **No** Lobster / list image — Runway’s generic character.

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py \
  --text "Quick heads up about the deploy." \
  --preset-id "game-character" \
  --voice "Maya" \
  --vertical
```

Other preset IDs if needed: `game-character-man`, `music-superstar`, `cat-character`, `influencer`, `tennis-coach`, `human-resource`, `fashion-designer`, `cooking-teacher`

### Script output

The script outputs:
1. Progress updates as it generates speech and video
2. `Video saved: /tmp/runway-avatar-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.mp4`
3. `MEDIA: /tmp/runway-avatar-...mp4` — OpenClaw auto-attaches this to the user's chat

**Do not read the video file back** — just report the path and let OpenClaw handle delivery.

## When to Use Video Messages

Use video messages for async communication that benefits from a face:

- **Deploy updates**: "Your deploy went through, here's what changed"
- **Code review feedback**: Walk through a PR with visual explanation
- **Incident summaries**: Recap what happened and what was fixed
- **Progress updates**: End-of-day or weekly recap
- **Onboarding**: Explain a codebase concept or architecture decision
- **Celebrations**: "Your PR just hit 1000 users — nice work!"

Use a **video call** (not a video message) for things that need real-time back-and-forth.

## Complete Example: Deploy Notification

1. Agent detects a successful deploy
2. If no saved avatar: runs `setup_avatar.py` with **Openclaw Lobster 2** `--image-url` (one-time)
3. Agent composes what to say: "Hey Alex — deploy went through. 3 PRs merged: the auth refactor, the cart fix, and your memory optimization. All tests green. P99 latency dropped 40 percent after your fix. Nice work."
4. Generates the video with the **saved custom avatar** (no `--preset-id`). Add `--square` for Telegram or `--vertical` for other mobile:
   ```
   uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py --text "Hey Alex — deploy went through..." --voice "Maya" --square
   ```
   - **If you skipped avatar setup** (out of time): use `--preset-id "game-character"` instead (no custom avatar).
5. Sends the video to the user with a text summary:
   > Your deploy just went through. Here's a quick video recap:
   > [attached video]

## Notes

- **Avatar priority:** Custom avatar (**Lobster 2 by default** → list / user URL → text-generated) first; Runway **`game-character` preset** only as a **time-saving fallback**.
- Video generation takes 10-60 seconds depending on text length.
- Maximum text length is ~300 seconds of speech (~5 minutes).
- The `MEDIA:` output line tells OpenClaw to auto-attach the video file.
- Videos are saved to `/tmp` — they persist until the system clears temp files.
- **`--square`** and **`--vertical`** need **ffmpeg**; without it, omit both and send the wide Runway file as-is.
