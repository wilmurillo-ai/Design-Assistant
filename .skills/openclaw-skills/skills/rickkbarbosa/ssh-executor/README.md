# ssh-executor 1.0.3

This release continues the packaging cleanup of **ssh-executor** and explicitly declares all runtime requirements used by the bundled helper.

## What changed in 1.0.3

- declares `python3` in skill metadata alongside `ssh` and `bash`
- keeps bundled script references aligned with `scripts/ssh-run.sh`
- keeps the release bundle coherent with `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, and `references/`

The outer `.zip` is for storage, review, and backup. The `.skill` is the actual distributable bundle.
