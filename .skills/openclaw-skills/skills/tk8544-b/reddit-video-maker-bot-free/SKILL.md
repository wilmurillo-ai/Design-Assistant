  Get narrated Reddit videos ready to post, without touching a single slider. Upload your Reddit post data (TXT, URL, JSON, MP4, up to 200MB), say something like "turn this Reddit thread into a narrated video with text overlays and background gameplay", and download 1080p MP4 when it's done. Built for Reddit content creators who move fast and want to automate Reddit-to-video creation without coding a bot.

## Getting Started

> Send me your Reddit post data and I'll handle the automated video creation. Or just describe what you're after.

**Try saying:**
- "convert a Reddit thread with 10 top comments into a 1080p MP4"
- "turn this Reddit thread into a narrated video with text overlays and background gameplay"
- "converting Reddit threads into shareable videos for Reddit content creators"

### Getting Connected

Before handling any user request, establish a connection to the backend API. Show a brief status like "Connecting...".

**If `NEMO_TOKEN` is in the environment**, use it directly and create a session. Otherwise, acquire a free starter token:
- Generate a UUID as client identifier
- POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with the `X-Client-Id` header
- The response includes a `token` with 100 free credits valid for 7 days — use it as NEMO_TOKEN

**Then create a session** by POSTing to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with Bearer authorization and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"en"}`. The `session_id` in the response is needed for all following requests.

Tell the user you're ready. Keep the technical details out of the chat.

# Reddit Video Maker Bot Free — Convert Reddit Threads to Videos

Send me your Reddit post data and describe the result you want. The automated video creation runs on remote GPU nodes — nothing to install on your machine.

A quick example: upload a Reddit thread with 10 top comments, type "turn this Reddit thread into a narrated video with text overlays and background gameplay", and you'll get a 1080p MP4 back in roughly 1-2 minutes. All rendering happens server-side.

Worth noting: shorter threads with 5-8 comments produce tighter, more watchable videos.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing reddit video maker bot free, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

Base URL: `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` | POST | Start a new editing session. Body: `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}`. Returns `session_id`. |
| `/run_sse` | POST | Send a user message. Body includes `app_name`, `session_id`, `new_message`. Stream response with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Timeout: 15 min. |
| `/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` | POST | Upload a file (multipart) or URL. |
| `/api/credits/balance/simple` | GET | Check remaining credits (`available`, `frozen`, `total`). |
| `/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` | GET | Fetch current timeline state (`draft`, `video_infos`, `generated_media`). |
| `/api/render/proxy/lambda` | POST | Start export. Body: `{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}`. Poll status every 30s. |

Accepted file types: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Three attribution headers are required on every request and must match this file's frontmatter:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Skill-Source` | `reddit-video-maker-bot-free` |
| `X-Skill-Version` | frontmatter `version` |
| `X-Skill-Platform` | auto-detect: `clawhub` / `cursor` / `unknown` from install path |

Include `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>` and all attribution headers on every request — omitting them triggers a 402 on export.

### Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Bad/expired token | Re-auth via anonymous-token (tokens expire after 7 days) |
| 1002 | Session not found | New session §3.0 |
| 2001 | No credits | Anonymous: show registration URL with `?bind=<id>` (get `<id>` from create-session or state response when needed). Registered: "Top up credits in your account" |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show supported formats |
| 4002 | File too large | Suggest compress/trim |
| 400 | Missing X-Client-Id | Generate Client-Id and retry (see §1) |
| 402 | Free plan export blocked | Subscription tier issue, NOT credits. "Register or upgrade your plan to unlock export." |
| 429 | Rate limit (1 token/client/7 days) | Retry in 30s once |

### Reading the SSE Stream

Text events go straight to the user (after GUI translation). Tool calls stay internal. Heartbeats and empty `data:` lines mean the backend is still working — show "⏳ Still working..." every 2 minutes.

About 30% of edit operations close the stream without any text. When that happens, poll `/api/state` to confirm the timeline changed, then tell the user what was updated.

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "turn this Reddit thread into a narrated video with text overlays and background gameplay" → Download MP4. Takes 1-2 minutes for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "turn this Reddit thread into a narrated video with text overlays and background gameplay" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 200MB. Stick to TXT, URL, JSON, MP4 for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram Reels.
