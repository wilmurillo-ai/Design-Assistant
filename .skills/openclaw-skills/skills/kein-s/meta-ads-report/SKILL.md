# Meta Ads Analytics & Event Finder

A powerful toolkit to monitor your Meta (Facebook/Instagram) advertising performance directly through chat. This bundle includes analytics reporting and an event discovery tool to ensure accurate tracking.

## 🚀 Capabilities

1.  **Ad Performance Reporting:**
    * Calculates **Spend**, **Conversions**, and **CAC (Cost Per Acquisition)**.
    * Breaks down data by **Ad Set**.
    * Supports natural language date ranges (e.g., "yesterday", "last month", "last 7 days").

2.  **Event Discovery Tool:**
    * Lists all raw event names (e.g., `offsite_conversion.custom...`) currently active in your ad account.
    * Helps you find the exact event name to configure for conversion tracking.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Q: My conversion count is 0, but I have sales.**
**A:** The default event is `offsite_conversion.fb_pixel_custom`. Your pixel might be using a different name like `purchase`, `lead`, or `start_trial`.
1.  Ask the bot: **"List all ad events"**.
2.  Copy the exact raw name from the list.
3.  Update your `META_EVENT_NAME` variable with that name.
