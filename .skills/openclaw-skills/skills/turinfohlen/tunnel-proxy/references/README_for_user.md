# TunnelProxy

HTTP Server + PTY Shell Forwarder - A lightweight all-in-one tool for file serving, remote shell, and file upload.
## 🙏 a few words from the heart

What can this tool do?

It enables AI to run commands on your computer. Just this one thing.

What does this mean?

AI can access the Internet using your IP address (you are blocked, not it).
AI can use your software (with the license you bought, it's free to use).
AI can use your computing power (you pay the electricity bill and it runs tasks).

Please don't:

- ❌ let AI crawl other people 's websites (you are blocked)
- ❌ let AI crack software (it's you who got into trouble)
- ❌ let AI boost traffic and orders (you are the one blocked by the platform)
- ❌ let AI cause trouble (it's you who loses the data)

Please be sure:

- ✅ use only if you have complete trust in AI
- ✅ first, use 'whoami' to see what permissions the AI is running with
- ✅ first use 'ls' to see which of your files the AI can see
- ✅ regularly check the command history to see what the AI has done

Remember:

The tools themselves are not good or bad, but the users should be responsible for themselves. **

This tool is like lending a friend a key to your home. Can friends steal things? Will you bring someone else here? This is not a matter of the key; it's a matter of whether you trust this friend or not.

If you can't trust it, don't lend it. **

---

🙏 May your AI help you grow, not cause you trouble.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Hex

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tunnel_proxy, "~> 0.1.3"}
  ]
end
```

Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TurinFohlen/tunnel_proxy.git
cd tunnel_proxy
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

Quick Start

Start the Server

```bash
export TUNNEL_DOC_ROOT="your/root/path"
export TUNNEL_UPLOAD_DIR="your/upload/path"
mkdir -p "$TUNNEL_DOC_ROOT" "$TUNNEL_UPLOAD_DIR"
mix run --no-halt -e "TunnelProxy.Server.start(8080)"
```

Expected output:

```
HTTP Server: 0.0.0.0:8080
PTY Forwarder: 0.0.0.0:27417
Doc Root: /path/to/current/www
Upload Dir: /path/to/current/uploads
```

Connect to Shell

```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 27417
```

Type commands and get output:

```bash
$ pwd
/path/to/current
$ ls -la
...file list...
$ exit
```

Access Files

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Open in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Upload Files

Via curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload --data-binary @file.txt
```

Via browser:
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload, select file, click upload.

Configuration

Create config/config.exs or set environment variables:

```elixir
config :tunnel_proxy,
  http_port: 8080,           # HTTP server port
  pty_port: 27417,           # Shell forwarder port
  doc_root: "./www",         # Static files directory
  upload_dir: "./uploads"    # Upload destination
```

Environment variables:

Variable Default Description
SHELL /bin/sh Shell to use for PTY forwarder
UPLOAD_MAGIC MY_MAGIC_2025_FILE_HEAD Magic word for upload validation

Use Cases

unix

```bash
cd ~/tunnel_proxy
mix run --no-halt -e "TunnelProxy.Server.start(8080)"
```

## With frp (Intranet Penetration)

Create a setup script that generates a secure, unique FRP configuration:

```bash
cat > setup-frp.sh << 'SETUP_EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# setup-frp.sh - Generate frpc.toml with a unique hash name

FRPC_CONFIG="frpc.toml"

# Generate 256-bit random name
PROXY_NAME="tunnel-$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# Random high ports (49152-65535)
HTTP_PORT=$((10001 + RANDOM % 40000))
SHELL_PORT=$((10001 + RANDOM % 40000))
while [ $SHELL_PORT -eq $HTTP_PORT ]; do
    SHELL_PORT=$((10001 + RANDOM % 40000))
done

# Write config with variable expansion (note: no quotes around EOF)
cat > "$FRPC_CONFIG" << FRPC_EOF
serverAddr = "frp.freefrp.net"
serverPort = 7000
auth.token = "freefrp.net"

[[proxies]]
name = "$PROXY_NAME-http"
type = "tcp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = ${TUNNEL_HTTP_PORT:-8080}
remotePort = $HTTP_PORT

[[proxies]]
name = "$PROXY_NAME-shell"
type = "tcp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = ${TUNNEL_PTY_PORT:-27417}
remotePort = $SHELL_PORT
FRPC_EOF

echo "✅ Generated $FRPC_CONFIG"
echo "   Proxy name prefix: $PROXY_NAME"
echo ""
echo "📋 Connection info (save these):"
echo "   HTTP:  frp.freefrp.net:$HTTP_PORT"
echo "   Shell: frp.freefrp.net:$SHELL_PORT"
echo ""
echo "🎲 Your service is now invisible to scanners."
SETUP_EOF

chmod 755 setup-frp.sh
./setup-frp.sh
```


After running, connect using the ports shown in the output,
then access from anywhere:
```bash
nc frp.freefrp.net <YOUR_SHELL_PORT>
curl http://frp.freefrp.net:<YOUR_HTTP_PORT>/
```
