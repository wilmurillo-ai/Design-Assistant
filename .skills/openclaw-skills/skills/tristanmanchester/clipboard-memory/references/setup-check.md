# Clipboard Memory — Setup Check

Prose mirror of `scripts/check-setup.sh`. Use this when your runtime can't execute shell scripts directly. Byte-identical across skill packages.

Run these commands in order. Stop at the first failure and repair before querying.

## 1. Binary present

```bash
clipmem --version
```

Expect a version line on stdout, exit code 0. If not, `clipmem` is missing from PATH. Install via `brew install tristanmanchester/tap/clipmem` or `cargo install clipmem`.

## 2. Database healthy

```bash
clipmem doctor --json
```

Expect exit 0 and `"fts5_create_virtual_table_ok": true` in the JSON payload. Non-zero exit means the SQLite archive is corrupt or inaccessible (failure is signalled via exit code, not a JSON `errors` field). `fts5_create_virtual_table_ok: false` means FTS queries will fail — either use `--mode literal` or rebuild the database.

## 3. Service and watcher freshness

```bash
clipmem service status --json
```

Expect `stale: false`. The report also tells you whether the Homebrew service (`homebrew.mxcl.clipmem`) or the direct LaunchAgent (`io.openclaw.clipmem.watch`) is loaded and running.

If the report says no background service is loaded, start one of these:

```bash
clipmem setup
# or
brew services start clipmem
```

## 4. OpenClaw integration (optional)

If the agent is OpenClaw, also check:

```bash
clipmem agents openclaw doctor
```

Expect every check to report `[OK]`. `[FAIL]` lines include remediation steps.

## Interpretation

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `clipmem` not found | binary not installed or not on PATH |
| `doctor` exits non-zero | database lock, corruption, or permission issue |
| `service status --json` reports `stale: true` | no recent captures and no background watcher running |
| FTS query errors | `fts5_create_virtual_table_ok: false` — switch to `--mode literal` |
| Sandboxed agent can't see the archive | PATH or file-access scope; rerun `openclaw sandbox explain` |

See `scripts/check-setup.sh` for the executable version with categorised exit codes (0 healthy, 1 watcher stale, 2 binary missing, 3 doctor failed).
