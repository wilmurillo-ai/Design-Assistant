# Mulch Self Improver 🌱

Injects a short reminder on `agent:bootstrap` (main sessions only): run `mulch prime`, record with `mulch record`, promote to SOUL/AGENTS/TOOLS. Benefits: better and more consistent coding, improved experience, less hallucination.

## Behavior

- **Event:** `agent:bootstrap`
- **Skips:** sub-agent sessions (`sessionKey` containing `:subagent:`)
- **Adds:** virtual file `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_REMINDER.md` with Mulch workflow

## Enable

```bash
openclaw hooks enable self-improvement
```
