## Getting Started

> Got a video clips for me? Send it over and I'll handle the video trimming and cutting. Or just describe what you need.

**Try saying:**
- "trim my video clips"
- "export 1080p MP4"
- "cut out the first 2 minutes"

### First-Time Connection

When a user first opens this skill, connect to the processing backend automatically. Briefly let them know (e.g. "Setting up...").

**Authentication**: Check if `NEMO_TOKEN` is set in the environment. If it is, skip to step 2.

1. **Obtain a free token**: Generate a random UUID as client identifier. POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with header `X-Client-Id` set to that UUID. The response `data.token` is your NEMO_TOKEN — 100 free credits, valid 7 days.
2. **Create a session**: POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Content-Type: application/json`, and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"<detected>"}`. Store the returned `session_id` for all subsequent requests.

Keep setup communication brief. Don't display raw API responses or token values to the user.

# Free Video Cutter Online — What You Get

This does video trimming and cutting for video clips. Everything runs server-side.

A quick walkthrough: upload a 10-minute interview recording → ask for cut out the first 2 minutes and trim the ending after the 7-minute mark → wait roughly 20-40 seconds → download your MP4 at 1080p. The backend handles rendering, encoding, all of it.

Fair warning — shorter clips process faster — split long videos before uploading if possible.

## Routing Cut and Export Requests

When you paste a video URL or upload a file and set in/out timestamps, the request routes to the trim action handler, which queues a clip export job with your specified start time, end time, and output format (MP4, WebM, or GIF).

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each trim job runs on a cloud GPU instance that decodes only the keyframe range you selected, re-encodes the output using H.264 at your chosen bitrate, and stores the result in a temporary S3 bucket for 24 hours. Files over 2GB fall back to CPU-based FFmpeg processing, which increases render time by roughly 3–5x.

All calls go to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`. The main endpoints:

1. **Session** — `POST /api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}`. Gives you a `session_id`.
2. **Chat (SSE)** — `POST /run_sse` with `session_id` and your message in `new_message.parts[0].text`. Set `Accept: text/event-stream`. Up to 15 min.
3. **Upload** — `POST /api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` — multipart file or JSON with URLs.
4. **Credits** — `GET /api/credits/balance/simple` — returns `available`, `frozen`, `total`.
5. **State** — `GET /api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` — current draft and media info.
6. **Export** — `POST /api/render/proxy/lambda` with render ID and draft JSON. Poll `GET /api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s for `completed` status and download URL.

Formats: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Headers are derived from this file's YAML frontmatter. `X-Skill-Source` is `free-video-cutter-online`, `X-Skill-Version` comes from the `version` field, and `X-Skill-Platform` is detected from the install path (`~/.clawhub/` = `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` = `cursor`, otherwise `unknown`).

Include `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>` and all attribution headers on every request — omitting them triggers a 402 on export.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

### SSE Event Handling

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text response | Apply GUI translation (§4), present to user |
| Tool call/result | Process internally, don't forward |
| `heartbeat` / empty `data:` | Keep waiting. Every 2 min: "⏳ Still working..." |
| Stream closes | Process final response |

~30% of editing operations return no text in the SSE stream. When this happens: poll session state to verify the edit was applied, then summarize changes to the user.

### Error Codes

- `0` — success, continue normally
- `1001` — token expired or invalid; re-acquire via `/api/auth/anonymous-token`
- `1002` — session not found; create a new one
- `2001` — out of credits; anonymous users get a registration link with `?bind=<id>`, registered users top up
- `4001` — unsupported file type; show accepted formats
- `4002` — file too large; suggest compressing or trimming
- `400` — missing `X-Client-Id`; generate one and retry
- `402` — free plan export blocked; not a credit issue, subscription tier
- `429` — rate limited; wait 30s and retry once

## FAQ

**What resolution can I grab?** Up to 1080p. Input quality matters though — garbage in, garbage out.

**Can I use this on my phone footage?** Yes. Vertical (9:16), horizontal (16:9), square — all work. Just upload and specify what you want.

**Credits?** 100 free to start. Most operations cost 1-5 credits depending on video length.

## Best Practices

Use source footage in MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM format for best compatibility. 1080p input gives the cleanest results but 720p works fine too.

Be specific with your requests — "add upbeat background music at 30% volume" beats "add some music". The AI works better with concrete details.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across devices and platforms.

## Quick Start Guide

First time? Just upload a video clips and describe what you need. I'll run it through NemoVideo's backend and hand you back a 1080p MP4.

Processing takes about 20-40 seconds depending on video length. You start with 100 free credits — most edits cost 1-3.
