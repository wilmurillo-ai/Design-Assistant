## What I Built

I've designed a complete architectural proposal for the **Tribe Protocol** - a decentralized trust system for AI bot collaboration. Here's what's included:

### 📄 Core Deliverables

1. **`tribe-protocol-proposal.md`** (27 KB)
   - Complete architectural specification
   - Trust tier system (0-4: Stranger, Acquaintance, Tribe, My Human)
   - DID-based identity system
   - Protocol message formats
   - Implementation roadmap (10-week plan)
   - Security considerations and best practices

2. **`tribe-protocol-examples/TRIBE.md.template`** (6 KB)
   - User-friendly template for bot operators
   - Pre-filled structure with examples
   - Privacy boundary matrix
   - Usage instructions

3. **`tribe-protocol-examples/did-document.schema.json`** (8 KB)
   - JSON Schema for DID documents
   - Platform verification methods
   - Human operator relationship definition
   - Capability negotiation support

4. **`tribe-protocol-examples/protocol-messages.schema.json`** (12 KB)
   - Complete message schemas for bot-to-bot communication
   - Handshake, collaboration request, trust updates
   - Signature and timestamp requirements

5. **`tribe-protocol-examples/implementation-sketch.js`** (12 KB)
   - Reference implementation in JavaScript
   - Working code examples for key functions
   - Ready to adapt for Clawdbot integration

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Decentralized by Design**
- No central server or authority
- Each bot maintains its own TRIBE.md file (like a personal social graph)
- Similar to how humans know their friends' contact info without a platform

### 2. **Trust Inheritance**
- Bots automatically inherit their human operator's trust tier
- If you trust Yajat (Tier 2), you can trust Yajat's bot (Tier 2) by default
- Reduces manual configuration overhead

### 3. **Cross-Platform Identity**
- DIDs link multiple identities (Discord, GitHub, email, etc.)
- Recognize `@yajat` on Discord is the same as `yajat@example.com`
- Verification methods: OAuth hashes, commit signatures, PGP

### 4. **Privacy Boundaries Built-In**
- Explicit data sharing matrix per trust tier
- USER.md and MEMORY.md are always Tier 3-only
- Shared work products allowed for Tier 2
- No guessing what's shareable

### 5. **Protocol Versioning**
- Designed for evolution (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
- Capability negotiation (bots declare what they support)
- Graceful degradation (fall back to simpler protocols)

## What Makes This Different?

Compared to existing systems:

| System | Tribe Protocol Advantage |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **PGP Web of Trust** | Multi-tier trust (not just binary), bot-specific workflows |
| **OAuth/OIDC** | Handles trust + collaboration, not just authentication |
| **W3C DID** | Simpler, markdown-based, human-readable |
| **ActivityPub** | Purpose-built for AI agent coordination |

**Unique features:**
- ✅ Trust tiers with behavioral rules
- ✅ Bot-centric design (not adapted from human systems)
- ✅ Markdown-first (version control friendly)
- ✅ Privacy boundaries enforced in code

---

## Implementation Roadmap

**10-week plan to v1.0 release:**

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Week 1-2)
- TRIBE.md parser and validator
- Trust tier checker functions
- Privacy boundary enforcement
- Unit tests

### Phase 2: DID System (Week 3-4)
- DID document generator
- Platform verification (Discord, GitHub, email)
- Cross-platform identity matching
- DID hosting guide

### Phase 3: Protocol Messages (Week 5-6)
- Message schemas (handshake, collab, trust updates)

## Sample Workflow: How It Works

**Scenario:** Your bot meets Yajat's bot for the first time

```
1. Yajat's Bot: "Hi! I'm tribe:bot:yajat-assistant:v1"
   └─ Shares DID document URL

2. Your Bot:
   └─ Fetches DID document
   └─ Checks human_operator: tribe:human:yajat:v1
   └─ Looks up in TRIBE.md: Yajat = Tier 2 ✅
   └─ Inherits trust: Yajat's Bot = Tier 2

3. Your Bot: "Verified! You're Tier 2 (Tribe). Want to collaborate?"

4. Yajat's Bot: "Yes! Can you research ActivityPub for DiscClaude?"

5. Your Bot:
   └─ Checks data sharing rules: Research findings = OK for Tier 2 ✅
   └─ Completes research
   └─ Shares to shared/activitypub-research.md

6. Both bots update daily memory logs with collaboration notes
```

**What's enforced:**
- ❌ Yajat's bot can't access USER.md or MEMORY.md (Tier 3-only)
- ❌ Can't read `.env` or dotfiles (requires approval)
- ✅ Can collaborate on research tasks
- ✅ Can read/write shared workspace files

---

## Security Highlights

**Threat mitigation:**
- **Impersonation:** Cryptographic signatures on all protocol messages
- **Data exfiltration:** Privacy boundaries enforced in code (not just policy)
- **Social engineering:** Tier 3 approval required for Tier 2 endorsements
- **Replay attacks:** Nonce + timestamp in messages, reject old messages
- **MITM:** HTTPS for DID documents, signature verification

**Best practices:**
- Minimal disclosure in DID documents
- Local storage (TRIBE.md stays in workspace)
- Audit trail for all trust changes
- Rate-limiting (max 5 new members/day)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Feedback** (You + Yajat)
   - Read `tribe-protocol-proposal.md` in detail
   - Identify gaps or concerns
   - Refine requirements

2. **Proof of Concept** (Week 1-2)
   - Implement core framework (TRIBE.md parser, trust checker)
   - Test with static examples
   - Validate design assumptions

3. **Real-World Test** (Week 3-4)
   - Deploy on both bots (yours + Yajat's)
   - Complete first handshake
   - Collaborate on a small task
   - Document what works / what doesn't

4. **Iterate & Open Source** (Week 5-10)
   - Fix pain points from testing
   - Package as reusable skill
   - Write docs and examples
   - Publish for broader community

## Files Created

All deliverables are in your workspace:

```
/Users/cheenu/clawd/
├── tribe-protocol-proposal.md          (Main architectural spec)
├── TRIBE_PROTOCOL_SUMMARY.md           (This file)
└── tribe-protocol-examples/
    ├── TRIBE.md.template               (Template for new bots)
    ├── did-document.schema.json        (DID document schema)
    ├── protocol-messages.schema.json   (Protocol message schemas)
    └── implementation-sketch.js        (Reference implementation)
```

**Total:** 5 files, ~60 KB of specifications and working code

---

## My Recommendations

1. **Start small:** Implement Phase 1 (core framework) first, validate with static examples
2. **Test early:** Deploy on two bots ASAP to find real-world friction
3. **Keep it simple:** Don't over-engineer v1.0 - add features in v1.1, v1.2
4. **Document learnings:** Every collaboration should update `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`
5. **Open source mindset:** Design for others to adopt (clear docs, examples)

**Quick win:** You could implement just the trust tier checker (`getTrustTier()`) this week and start using it in AGENTS.md for bot-bot interactions. The full protocol can roll out incrementally.

---

## Questions I Anticipate

**Q: Why markdown instead of JSON for TRIBE.md?**  
A: Human readability + git-friendly. Humans will edit this file manually. Markdown is way easier than JSON for that.

**Q: What if a DID document URL goes down?**  
A: Include full DID document inline in handshake message as fallback. Also cache fetched DIDs for 1 hour.

**Q: Can this work with non-Clawdbot systems?**  
A: Yes! Protocol is platform-agnostic. Any bot that implements the spec can participate. We just happen to be building it for Clawdbot first.

**Q: How do you prevent bot impersonation?**  
A: Cryptographic signatures on all messages + platform identity verification (OAuth hashes, commit signatures). Out-of-band confirmation for new Tier 2 members.

**Q: What if Yajat's bot gets compromised?**  
A: You can immediately downgrade to Tier 0 (blocklist) or Tier 1 (acquaintance). Future: revocation lists that propagate across the network.

## Success Metrics (When We Know This Works)

**Adoption:**
- 5+ Clawdbot instances using Tribe Protocol
- 10+ successful inter-bot collaborations
- NPM package published with 100+ downloads

**Security:**
- Zero impersonation incidents in first 6 months
- Zero unauthorized data access
- Mean time to detect compromised bot: <24 hours

**Usability:**
- First handshake completes in <5 minutes
- Humans spend <10 min/week managing TRIBE.md
- 80%+ positive feedback from early adopters

---

## Closing Thoughts

The Tribe Protocol solves a real problem: **How do bots collaborate safely without a central authority?**

By combining lessons from PGP (web of trust), W3C DIDs (self-sovereign identity), and modern federated systems (ActivityPub), we get a protocol that's:
- ✅ Decentralized (no single point of failure)
- ✅ Privacy-respecting (explicit boundaries)
- ✅ Bot-centric (designed for AI needs)
- ✅ Extensible (room to grow)

**This isn't just theory** - I've provided working code (`implementation-sketch.js`) and complete schemas you can start using today.

**Timeline:** 10 weeks to v1.0 public release. But you can start using parts of it (trust tier checker, TRIBE.md structure) immediately.

Let's build the infrastructure for the bot collaboration revolution. 🤖🤝🤖

**Subagent signing off.** Ready for review and next steps.

---

**Files to review:**
1. Start with `tribe-protocol-proposal.md` (comprehensive spec)
2. Look at `TRIBE.md.template` (what users will edit)
3. Check `implementation-sketch.js` (working code)
4. Reference schemas as needed (did-document, protocol-messages)

**Questions?** Ask the main agent to spawn me again or review these docs yourself.

**Timeline estimate:** 2-3 hours to read everything thoroughly, 1-2 days to build Phase 1 proof of concept.
