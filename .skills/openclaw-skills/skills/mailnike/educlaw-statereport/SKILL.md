# EduClaw State Reporting

State reporting, Ed-Fi API integration, data validation, and submission tracking
for K-12 Local Education Agencies (LEAs).

## Security Model

- **Local-only data**: All records stored in `~/.openclaw/erpclaw/data.sqlite`
- **Fully offline by default**: No network activity during data entry, validation, snapshot, or submission tracking
- **No credentials required for core operations**: Uses erpclaw_lib shared library (installed by erpclaw)
- **SQL injection safe**: All queries use parameterized statements
- **Ed-Fi sync is opt-in**: The `submit-*-to-edfi` and `get-edfi-connection-test` actions make outbound HTTPS calls to a configured ODS endpoint only when explicitly invoked. These are the sole source of external network activity.
- **Credential protection**: OAuth client secrets are encrypted before database insertion. Decrypted values are never returned in action output, logs, or error messages.
