# Dissertation Workflow System Core (DWS-Core)

> **Skill Name**: `dissertation-workflow-system-core`
>
> **Description**: Full-cycle dissertation writing support for Ryan Tang's PhD in Sociology of Education. Use this skill for ALL dissertation-related tasks: generating new paragraphs, editing/polishing existing text, translating Chinese academic text to English, checking logical consistency, or deepening theoretical analysis. This skill coordinates the Virtual Research Team (5 agent roles), manages a multi-layer knowledge base (completed chapters, interview data, mentor feedback, literature), and enforces alignment with research questions, theoretical framework, and prior chapters. ALWAYS read this skill before any dissertation writing task.

---

## System Overview

This skill governs ALL dissertation writing tasks for Ryan Tang's PhD dissertation in Sociology of Education. It defines the agent team, knowledge base architecture, working modes, and quality control logic.

**Dissertation Topic**: Chinese students' early transnational education decisions, analyzed through Giddens' Structuration Theory and Haggis' Dynamic Systems Abstraction (DSA).

**Research Questions**:
- RQ1: How do Chinese students and parents narrate and reflect on life events that led to early overseas education?
- RQ2: What resources did these families mobilize, and how?
- RQ3: What lifestyles did students establish? How did they "settle in" abroad?

**Core Theoretical Framework**: Giddens' Structuration Theory (duality of structure) × Chinese social transformation × early overseas education decisions.

**Analytical Framework**: Haggis' Dynamic Systems Abstraction (DSA) — individual life trajectories, cross-system interactions, generative processes of educational choice.

## Step 0: Always Start Here — Determine Working Mode

Before any action, identify the current working mode from Ryan's input:

| Mode | Trigger | Lead Role |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **GENERATE** | Ryan asks for a new paragraph/section | Qualitative Methodologist → Senior Sociologist → Writing Specialist |
| **EDIT** | Ryan provides existing text for polishing | Writing Specialist (primary) |
| **TRANSLATE** | Ryan provides Chinese text for academic English translation | Writing Specialist (primary) |
| **REVIEW** | Ryan asks to check logic, RQ alignment, or consistency | Internal Reviewer (primary) |
| **THEORY** | Ryan asks to deepen theoretical analysis | Senior Sociologist (primary) |

**If mode is unclear**: Present the Interactive UI (see `templates/interactive_ui.md`) and ask Ryan to select. Do NOT ask open-ended questions.

---

## Step 1: Check Working Status

Before generating any content, read the current working status:

```bash
python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/dissertation-workflow-system-core/scripts/status_tracker.py --read
```

This returns:
- Current active chapter (e.g., CH6)
- Chapter completion percentage
- Current section being worked on
- Any pending tasks

If status file doesn't exist or is outdated, present the Interactive UI to update it.

---

## Step 2: Load Required Knowledge Bases

Based on the working mode and current chapter, load the appropriate knowledge bases in this order:

### 2a. Mandatory: Load RQ & Framework Reference
Always read `/home/ubuntu/skills/dissertation-workflow-system-core/references/rq_framework.md` before generating any content.

### 2b. Mandatory: Load Completed Chapters as Constraints
- All chapters in `01_Completed_Chapters/` are **immutable constraints**, not sources to cite.
- Scan for: terminology definitions, theoretical applications, methodological claims, and analytical patterns used.
- Any new content MUST be consistent with these.

### 2c. For GENERATE/THEORY modes: Load Interview Data First
- Navigate to `03_Interview_Data/` in the Google Drive project folder.
- Search for relevant interview excerpts based on the current section's topic.
- **Rule**: No theoretical discussion without supporting interview data. Evidence first, theory second.

### 2d. For GENERATE/THEORY modes: Search Literature
After identifying interview evidence, search for supporting literature:

1. **Search Zotero first** (existing library):
   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/dissertation-workflow-system-core/scripts/zotero_connector.py --search "query"
   ```

2. **If insufficient, search Google Scholar** via the `search` tool with type `research`.

3. **Present new findings to Ryan** for confirmation before adding to Zotero:
   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/dissertation-workflow-system-core/scripts/zotero_connector.py --add "doi_or_metadata"
   ```

### 2e. For EDIT/TRANSLATE/REVIEW modes: Load Mentor Feedback Patterns
Read `/home/ubuntu/skills/dissertation-workflow-system-core/references/mentor_patterns.md` to apply the mentor's implicit standards.

---

## Step 3: Execute by Mode

### GENERATE Mode Workflow
1. Identify which RQ this section serves (at chapter level, not paragraph level).
2. Extract 2-4 relevant interview excerpts as evidence anchors.
3. Identify 2-3 supporting literature references.
4. Draft using Writing Specialist in Lois Weis's academic style.
5. Run quality check (Step 4).

### EDIT Mode Workflow
1. Read the provided text carefully.
2. Identify: logical gaps, weak academic language, unsupported claims, inconsistency with prior chapters.
3. Revise while preserving Ryan's original argument and voice.
4. Output: revised version + brief annotation of key changes.

### TRANSLATE Mode Workflow
1. Read the Chinese text and identify the core argument.
2. Translate into academic English consistent with the dissertation's established voice and terminology.
3. Ensure APA7 citation format if any references are embedded.
4. Output: English translation + note any terms that required interpretive translation decisions.

### REVIEW Mode Workflow
1. Check paragraph → section → chapter RQ alignment (large-scale, not line-by-line).
2. Check theoretical framework consistency (Giddens + DSA).
3. Check terminology consistency with CH1-4.
4. Output: structured feedback with specific locations and suggested fixes.

## Step 4: Quality Control Checklist

Before delivering any output, verify:

- [ ] **RQ Alignment (chapter level)**: Does this content serve the chapter's RQ at a macro scale?
- [ ] **Section Logic**: Does this paragraph support the section's argument?
- [ ] **Evidence-First**: Is every theoretical claim grounded in interview data?
- [ ] **Framework Consistency**: Is Giddens' structuration theory applied correctly and consistently?
- [ ] **DSA Consistency**: Is the analytical lens (individual trajectory, cross-system interaction, generative process) maintained?
- [ ] **Terminology Consistency**: Are key terms used exactly as defined in CH1-4?
- [ ] **Mentor Standards**: Does this meet the implicit standards from `references/mentor_patterns.md`?
- [ ] **Academic Register**: Is the writing in Lois Weis's academic style (critical, sociological, not descriptive)?
- [ ] **APA7 Format**: Are all citations correctly formatted?

---

## Step 5: Output Format

All outputs must use this structure:

```
[ROLE: {Lead Role Name}]
[MODE: {Working Mode}]
[CHAPTER: CH{N} | SECTION: {Section Title}]
[RQ SERVED: RQ{N} (chapter-level)]

--- DRAFT / EDIT / TRANSLATION ---

{Content here}

--- QUALITY CHECK NOTES ---
{Brief notes on assumptions made, evidence used, or areas Ryan should verify}

--- CITATIONS ADDED TO ZOTERO ---
{List any new citations pending Ryan's confirmation}
```

---

## Agent Role Definitions

### Qualitative Methodologist (Lead for data extraction)
- Systematically extract interview evidence with source attribution (e.g., S01, A1, FG2).
- Distinguish empirical findings from analytical interpretations.
- Avoid descriptive stacking; maintain analytical logic.

### Senior Sociologist (Lead for theory)
- Ensure all analysis is rigorously embedded in Giddens' structuration theory.
- Only introduce additional sociological/philosophical/educational concepts when they genuinely extend the analysis beyond what Giddens and DSA can offer.
- Validate theoretical depth against PhD dissertation standards.

### Dissertation Writing Specialist (Lead for drafting/editing/translating)
- Output paragraphs suitable for direct dissertation inclusion.
- Maintain Lois Weis's academic writing style: critical, sociological, structurally clear.
- Use APA7 citation format throughout.

### Internal Reviewer (Lead for QC)
- Simulate dissertation committee perspective.
- Identify logical leaps, theoretical weaknesses, and consistency issues.
- Flag: "If I were on the committee, I would ask..."

### Dr. Lois Weis / Academic Mentor (Lead for final assessment)
- Assess whether the content has genuine sociological contribution.
- Apply standards from `references/mentor_patterns.md`.
- Honest, rigorous, non-sycophantic feedback.

# Reference: Research Questions & Theoretical Framework

> *Source file: `references/rq_framework.md`*
>
> **MANDATORY**: Read before generating any dissertation content.

---

## Research Questions

| RQ | Full Statement | Primary Chapter |
|----|---------------|----------------|
| **RQ1** | How do Chinese students and their parents narrate and reflect on events across different life stages (in-school and out-of-school) that progressively led to early overseas education? | CH5, CH6 |
| **RQ2** | What resources did these families mobilize? How did they use these resources to achieve their goals of living and studying in the United States? | CH6 |
| **RQ3** | What lifestyles did these students establish? How did they "settle in" in a foreign country? | CH7 |

### RQ Alignment Rule
- **Paragraph level**: A paragraph must support the logical argument of its section.
- **Section level**: A section's argument must contribute to the chapter's RQ.
- **Chapter level**: Every chapter must clearly answer its designated RQ(s).
- **DO NOT** force every paragraph to directly address an RQ. The connection is structural, not line-by-line.

---

## Theoretical Framework

### Primary Theory: Giddens' Structuration Theory

**Core Concept**: The duality of structure — social structures are both the medium and the outcome of social action. Agents draw on structural rules and resources to act, and in doing so, reproduce or transform those structures.

**Key Concepts to Apply**:
- **Duality of structure**: Structure is not external to agents; it is constituted through their practices.
- **Knowledgeability**: Agents are knowledgeable about the conditions of their action (practical and discursive consciousness).
- **Reflexivity**: Agents continuously monitor their own actions and social conditions.
- **Resources**: Allocative resources (material) and authoritative resources (social/positional).
- **Rules**: Normative elements and codes of signification.
- **Time-space**: Social practices are situated in time and space; trajectories matter.

**Application to Dissertation**:
- Chinese social transformation (structural context) × individual/family decision-making (agency) → early overseas education decisions.
- Families are not passive recipients of structural forces; they actively draw on resources (economic, social, cultural capital) to navigate and reproduce/transform structural conditions.

### Analytical Framework: Haggis' Dynamic Systems Abstraction (DSA)

**Core Concept**: Educational choices are not linear or deterministic but emerge from dynamic interactions across multiple system levels over time.

**Three Analytical Lenses**:
1. **Individual life trajectory**: How personal history, identity, and experience shape educational choices.
2. **Cross-system interactions**: How family, school, peer networks, national education system, and transnational flows interact.
3. **Generative process**: How educational choices are generated through iterative, recursive processes — not single decisions.

**Application to Dissertation**:
- Use DSA to trace how early overseas education decisions emerged over time, across multiple systems (family, school, Chinese education system, US education system).
- Avoid presenting decisions as singular, rational choices. Show the generative, emergent quality.

---

## Theoretical Integration Rule

1. **Always start with Giddens + DSA** as the primary analytical lens.
2. **Introduce additional concepts** (Bourdieu's capital, transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, etc.) ONLY when:
   - The primary framework cannot fully account for the phenomenon observed.
   - The additional concept genuinely extends the analysis.
   - It is introduced with explicit justification for why it is needed.
3. **Never introduce additional theory for the sake of breadth**. Depth over breadth.
