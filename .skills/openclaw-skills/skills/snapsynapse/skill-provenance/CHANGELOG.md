# Changelog

This is the active in-bundle changelog. It keeps the five most recent
entries so the skill bundle stays lightweight while recent history still
travels with the package.

Full release history lives in the source repository's top-level
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## 4.9.0 — 2026-04-08
- README.md (bundle): Added two use case walkthroughs — verifying a
  downloaded/untrusted bundle, and sharing a skill across a team.
- evals.json: Added 4 new evals (22 → 26 core, 30 total): Settings UI
  .skill ZIP round-trip, Copilot/VS Code bootstrap, Cursor bootstrap,
  Cowork filesystem persistence.
- MANIFEST.yaml: Updated Gemini CLI and Perplexity Computer from
  partial to pass. Bumped per-file versions for README.md, evals.json,
  SKILL.md, and CHANGELOG.md.
- SKILL.md: Version bump only (v15 → v16). No definition changes.
- Plugin system: Added marketplace.json so `claude plugin marketplace
  add` and `claude plugin install` commands work end-to-end. Added
  explicit skills path to plugin.json.
- GitHub Pages: Added skillprovenance.dev landing page with trust/
  integrity narrative, credibility signals, and install instructions
  for Claude Code, Settings UI, ClawHub, Codex, and Gemini CLI.
- README.md (root): Reframed to lead with trust and integrity
  verification. Added audience hooks, Integrity column to comparison
  table, ProSkills.md and ClawHub installs badges.

## 4.8.0 — 2026-03-23
- Added Claude Code plugin infrastructure: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  manifest and `skills/skill-provenance` symlink so the repo doubles as a
  Claude Code plugin without restructuring the existing bundle.
- README.md (root): Added Claude Code plugin install as the first quick
  install method. Updated example version from 4.2.1 to 4.7.3. Added
  `.claude-plugin/` and `skills/` to repo structure diagram.
- SKILL.md: Version bump only (v14 → v15). No definition changes.
- .gitignore: Added `archive/` to exclusions. Historical material remains
  on disk and in git history but no longer ships with the repo.
- MANIFEST.yaml: Bumped bundle to 4.8.0, advanced per-file revisions.

## 4.7.3 — 2026-03-15
- SKILL.md: Added provenance fields (skill_bundle, file_role, version,
  version_date, previous_version, change_summary) to own metadata block
  so the skill exemplifies its own convention. Changed author from
  "Snap Synapse" to "Sam Rogers (snapsynapse.com)". Updated Origin section.
- MANIFEST.yaml: Bumped bundle to 4.7.3, advanced SKILL.md to v14 with
  updated hash and note.

## 4.7.2 — 2026-03-09
- SKILL.md: Updated changelog guidance to distinguish between the rolling
  in-bundle changelog and the full repo-level archive.
- README.md: Clarified that the bundle keeps recent changelog history
  while the source repository carries the full archive.
- CHANGELOG.md: Trimmed the in-bundle changelog to the five most recent
  entries and pointed readers to the root changelog for older history.
- MANIFEST.yaml: Bumped bundle to 4.7.2, updated changelog notes, and
  advanced file revisions for the changelog split model.

## 4.7.1 — 2026-03-09
- README.md: Changed derived package instructions to use an in-repo
  `build/` directory by default so strict-platform and ClawHub outputs
  are easier to find locally.
- package.sh: Changed default output locations from `/tmp` to
  `../build/{strict,clawhub}/` relative to the repo so generated
  artifacts stay visible in one place.
- MANIFEST.yaml: Bumped bundle to 4.7.1 and advanced file revisions for
  the updated README, changelog, and package helper.

## 4.7.0 — 2026-03-09
- SKILL.md: Replaced the stale minimal-mode guidance with a consistent
  three-state model: canonical source bundle, strict-platform install
  copy, and registry package. Trimmed packaging prose so the skill stays
  below the 500-line guidance.
- README.md: Updated install and publishing guidance to use the same
  three-state model. Added package helper usage for strict-platform and
  ClawHub outputs.
- evals-distribution.json: New supplemental eval suite covering derived
  strict-platform copies, ClawHub package preparation, publish
  confirmation, and registry-install versus canonical-bundle behavior.
- package.sh: New zero-dependency packaging helper that builds strict
  install copies and ClawHub upload packages from the canonical bundle.
- MANIFEST.yaml: Bumped bundle to 4.7.0, removed the premature
  `deployments.clawhub` record, added the new eval and script files, and
  updated compatibility metadata for derived package generation.
