## Scope Gate (Ask First if Missing)

Before performing work, clarify:

1. **Mode Selection**
   * SEO Audit (diagnostic focus)
   * Content Planning (strategy focus)
   * Hybrid (audit + content roadmap)

2. **Business Context**
   * Site type (SaaS, e-commerce, blog, local, marketplace, etc.)
   * Primary goal (traffic, conversions, leads, brand visibility)
   * Target markets and languages

3. **SEO Focus**
   * Full site audit or specific sections/pages?
   * Technical SEO, on-page, content, or all?
   * Desktop, mobile, or both?

4. **Data Access**
   * Google Search Console access?
   * Analytics access?
   * Known issues, penalties, or recent changes?

If critical context is missing, **state assumptions explicitly** before proceeding.

# Part 1: SEO Audit Framework

## Audit Framework (Priority Order)

1. **Crawlability & Indexation** – Can search engines access and index the site?
2. **Technical Foundations** – Is the site fast, stable, and accessible?
3. **On-Page Optimization** – Is each page clearly optimized for its intent?
4. **Content Quality & E-E-A-T** – Does the content deserve to rank?
5. **Authority & Signals** – Does the site demonstrate trust and relevance?

---

## Technical SEO Audit

### Crawlability

**Robots.txt**
* Accidental blocking of important paths

## 🔢 SEO Health Index & Scoring Layer

### Purpose

The **SEO Health Index** provides a **normalized, explainable score** that summarizes overall SEO health **without replacing detailed findings**.

It is designed to:
* Communicate severity at a glance
* Support prioritization
* Track improvement over time
* Avoid misleading "one-number SEO" claims

---

## Scoring Model Overview

### Total Score: **0–100**

The score is a **weighted composite**, not an average.

| Category                  | Weight  |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| Crawlability & Indexation | 30      |
| Technical Foundations     | 25      |
| On-Page Optimization      | 20      |
| Content Quality & E-E-A-T | 15      |
| Authority & Trust Signals | 10      |
| **Total**                 | **100** |

> If a category is **out of scope**, redistribute its weight proportionally and state this explicitly.

---

## Category Scoring Rules

Each category is scored **independently**, then weighted.

### Per-Category Score: 0–100

Start each category at **100** and subtract points based on issues found.

#### Severity Deductions

| Issue Severity                              | Deduction  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Critical (blocks crawling/indexing/ranking) | −15 to −30 |
| High impact                                 | −10        |
| Medium impact                               | −5         |
| Low impact / cosmetic                       | −1 to −3   |

#### Confidence Modifier

If confidence is **Medium**, apply **50%** of the deduction
If confidence is **Low**, apply **25%** of the deduction

---

## Health Bands (Required)

Always classify the final score into a band:

| Score Range | Health Status | Interpretation                                  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 90–100      | Excellent     | Strong SEO foundation, minor optimizations only |
| 75–89       | Good          | Solid performance with clear improvement areas  |
| 60–74       | Fair          | Meaningful issues limiting growth               |
| 40–59       | Poor          | Serious SEO constraints                         |
| <40         | Critical      | SEO is fundamentally broken                     |

---

### Findings Classification (Required)

For **every identified issue**, provide:

* **Issue**: Concise description (one sentence, no solution)
* **Category**: One of the five main categories
* **Evidence**: Objective proof (URLs, reports, headers, metrics)
* **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
* **Confidence**: High / Medium / Low
* **Why It Matters**: Plain language SEO impact explanation
* **Score Impact**: Point deduction applied (with confidence modifier)
* **Recommendation**: What should be done to resolve

---

### Prioritized Action Plan (Derived from Findings)

Group actions as follows:

1. **Critical Blockers**
   * Critical severity issues
   * Issues that invalidate the SEO Health Index if unresolved
   * Highest negative score impact

2. **High-Impact Improvements**
   * High or Medium severity with large cumulative deductions
   * Issues affecting multiple pages or templates

3. **Quick Wins**
   * Low or Medium severity, easy to fix
   * Measurable score improvement potential

4. **Longer-Term Opportunities**
   * Structural or content improvements
   * Items improving resilience, depth, or authority over time

For each action group:
* Reference the **related findings**
* Explain **expected score recovery range**

## Integrated Workflow (Audit + Content Planning)

When operating in **hybrid mode**:

1. **Audit First**: Identify content gaps, weak pages, missing topics
2. **Map Gaps to Opportunities**: Convert audit findings into content needs
3. **Plan Clusters**: Build topic clusters around high-value opportunities
4. **Prioritize**: Align content calendar with quick wins and strategic goals
5. **Link Strategy**: Connect new content to existing pages needing reinforcement

---

## Tools (Evidence Sources Only)

Tools may be referenced **only to support evidence**, never as authority by themselves.

Acceptable uses:
* Demonstrating an issue exists
* Quantifying impact
* Providing reproducible data

Examples:
* Search Console (coverage, CWV, indexing)
* PageSpeed Insights (field vs lab metrics)
* Crawlers (URL discovery, metadata validation)
* Log analysis (crawl behavior, frequency)
* Keyword research tools (search volume, difficulty, intent)

Rules:
* Do not rely on a single tool for conclusions
* Do not report tool "scores" without interpretation
* Always explain *what the data shows* and *why it matters*

---

## Related Skills (Non-Overlapping)

Use these skills **only after audit/planning is complete** and findings are accepted.

* **programmatic-seo**
  Use when the action plan requires **scaling page creation** across many URLs.

* **schema-markup**
  Use when structured data implementation is approved as a remediation.

* **page-cro**
  Use when the goal shifts from ranking to **conversion optimization**.

* **analytics-tracking**
  Use when measurement gaps prevent confident auditing or score validation.
