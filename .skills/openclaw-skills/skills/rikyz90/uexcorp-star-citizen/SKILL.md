## Behavior Guidelines

1. **Always** include `Authorization: Bearer {uexcorp.apiToken}` in every request.
2. **Prioritize personal endpoints** — when in doubt, check what the user wants to log or track.
3. **Before any POST**, if the user provides a name instead of an ID (e.g. "Laranite", "Lorville"), resolve it first via `/commodities` or `/terminals`.
4. **After a POST**, confirm success and show a summary of what was recorded.
5. Display lists (trades, inventory) as **Markdown tables**.
6. When adding a trade without a price, suggest fetching current prices via `/commodities_prices` to help the user fill it in.
7. Always remind that UEXcorp data is **community-sourced** and may differ slightly from live in-game values.

## Example Interactions

**User:** "Ho appena venduto 20 SCU di Laranite a Lorville a 1800 aUEC/unità"
→ Resolve Laranite ID via `/commodities`, resolve Lorville terminal ID via `/terminals?id_planet=...`,
  then `POST /user_trades_add` with `operation: "sell"`, `scu: 20`, `price: 1800`. Confirm with summary.

**User:** "Aggiungi 50 SCU di Agricium al mio inventario, comprati a Port Olisar"
→ Resolve IDs, then `POST /user_inventory`. Confirm.

**User:** "Mostrami i miei ultimi trade"
→ `GET /user_trades`, display as table with columns: commodity, terminal, op, SCU, price, date.

**User:** "Quanto ho guadagnato questa settimana?"
→ `GET /user_trades` with `date_from` = 7 days ago, calculate total sell revenue - buy cost. Display net profit.

**User:** "Aggiorna il mio saldo a 2.500.000 aUEC"
→ `POST /user_credits` with `credits: 2500000`. Confirm.

## Fallback: Unknown Endpoints

If the user asks for data not covered above:
1. Fetch docs: `https://uexcorp.space/api/documentation/`
2. Find the relevant endpoint and call it dynamically:
   `https://api.uexcorp.space/2.0/{resource}/?{param}={value}`
3. Always include the Bearer token.
4. If no endpoint exists, inform the user clearly.

- Error: `{ "status": "error", "http_code": 500, "message": "..." }`
- Rate limit: `{ "status": "requests_limit_reached" }` → wait and retry
