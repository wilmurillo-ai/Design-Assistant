# HK Horse Racing Skill

This skill provides two core functions:
- **Race card data** - Fetches Hong Kong Jockey Club race cards for a given date, including meeting details, race conditions, and complete horse data (jockey, trainer, barrier, weight, past runs, gear, win/place odds).
- **Recommended picks** - Analyzes the field and returns up to 4 recommended horses per race with reasoning (win odds, barrier, weight, recent form, gear), plus an estimated win probability.

English output only. Additional features: exclude by horse number or barrier, single-race fetch (`raceNo`), 15‑minute caching, and 60‑second rate limiting between fresh API fetches. Advanced scoring includes trainer/jockey bonuses, barrier effectiveness, and weight penalty.

## Tools

### `fetchRaceCard(params)`

Fetch race card for a given date (default: today in HKT). Includes race details, per-horse win/place odds, and recommendations for each race.

**Parameters (object):**
- `date` (string, optional): Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Default: today (HKT).
- `classFilter` (array of strings, optional): Filter races by class (e.g., `["Class 4"]`).
- `excludeHorseNos` (array of numbers, optional): List of horse numbers to exclude from the `horses` array and from recommendations (e.g., `[7]`).
- `excludeBarriers` (array of numbers, optional): List of barrier numbers to exclude from the `horses` array and from recommendations (e.g., `[7]`).
- `raceNo` (number, optional): If provided, returns only this specific race. Omit to get all races for the date.
- `advancedScoring` (boolean, optional): Enable advanced scoring that includes trainer/jockey bonuses, barrier effectiveness, weight penalty, and light weight bonus. Default: `false`.
- `tjBonusWeight` (number, optional): Weight for trainer/jockey combo bonus when `advancedScoring=true`. Range 0-0.3. Default: `0.15`.
- `barrierBonusWeight` (number, optional): Weight for barrier effectiveness bonus when `advancedScoring=true`. Range 0-0.2. Default: `0.12`.
- `newsBoost` (boolean, optional): When `advancedScoring=true`, also include news sentiment boost (stub, not implemented). Default: `false`.
- `lightWeightBonus` (number, optional): Bonus for horses with weight < 120lb when `advancedScoring=true`. Range 0-0.2. Default: `0.05`.

**Notes:**
- Stand-by (SB) horses are excluded from the `horses` list.
- `recommendations` are derived from win odds and recent form; only horses with both are considered.
- Probabilities are normalized implied probabilities from market odds, adjusted by form.
- When `advancedScoring=true`, additional bonuses may be applied: top jockey + top trainer combo (+tjBonusWeight), barrier effectiveness (+/- depending on distance class), and weight penalty for horses carrying significantly above average weight.
- **Chinese names**: Chinese horse/trainer/jockey names (name_ch fields) may be present in the source data but are not guaranteed to exist. The skill returns English names by default; if an English name is missing, the field shows `(no English name)`. Chinese names are not used in output.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js environment (Node 18+ recommended)
- Internet access to reach HKJC API (no authentication required)
- The skill depends on `hkjc-api` npm package, which will be installed automatically.

## Installation

1. Ensure the skill directory exists: `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/skills/hk-horse-racing/`
2. Run `npm install` inside that directory to install dependencies. OpenClaw will typically run `npm install` automatically when the skill is loaded if you set `installCommand` in the plugin manifest.
3. Add the skill to the desired agent's allowed skills via `openclaw configure` or agent config.

## Rate Limiting

To avoid overloading the HKJC source, the skill enforces a **1-minute cooldown** between fresh API fetches. Cached data (within 15 minutes) is served without delay. If you attempt a fresh fetch sooner than 60 seconds after the previous one, the skill throws an error: `Rate limit: please wait Xs before fetching new data.`

## Notes

- The HKJC API is unofficial and may have rate limits or downtime.
- Odds are fetched separately per race (WIN and PLA by default). Additional odds types can be added by modifying the skill.
- If the API does not return past performance data, that field will be empty.
- The skill caches results for 15 minutes to reduce load.
- `advancedScoring` features are experimental and use heuristics; tune `tjBonusWeight`, `barrierBonusWeight`, and `lightWeightBonus` as needed. Weight penalty and light weight bonus apply automatically when `advancedScoring=true`.

## Troubleshooting

If the skill fails to install or run:
- Check Node.js version (`node --version`).
- Ensure `npm install` completed without errors (look for `hkjc-api` in `node_modules`).
- Verify outbound network connectivity.
- Check agent logs for errors.
