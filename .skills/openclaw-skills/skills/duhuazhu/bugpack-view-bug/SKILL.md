# BugPack - View Bug Details

Fetch full bug context from BugPack, including description, screenshots, environment info, and related files.

## Instructions

1. Call `GET http://localhost:3456/api/bugs/:id` to get the full bug details.
2. The response includes:
   - `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`
   - `pagePath` — the page/route where the bug occurs
   - `device`, `browser` — environment info
   - `relatedFiles` — array of file paths related to the bug
   - `screenshots` — array of screenshot objects with `id`, `name`, `original_path`, `annotated_path`
3. Display the bug info in a structured format.
4. If the bug has screenshots, mention them and offer to show annotated versions.
5. If `relatedFiles` are listed, use them to locate relevant source code.
