# Security Scanner Skill

Comprehensive static analysis tool for detecting vulnerabilities, malware patterns, and security issues in code and skills.

## Overview

Security Scanner performs deep static analysis on:
- **Code files** (.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx, .py, .go, .java, .rb, .php, .sh)
- **Skill directories** (recursively scans all code)
- **Inline code snippets**

It flags dangerous patterns, suspicious behaviors, and obfuscation, then provides actionable recommendations.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scan a skill directory
security-scanner ./my-skill/

# Scan a single file
security-scanner ./package.js

# Scan code snippet
security-scanner --code "eval(userInput)"

# Get JSON output
security-scanner ./skill --output json

# See suggested fixes
security-scanner ./skill --fix
```

## Risk Levels & Recommendations

### 🔴 DANGEROUS → REJECT
**Verdict:** Do not install this code.

Detected patterns:
- `eval()` - Arbitrary code execution
- `exec()` - Command execution
- Dynamic `require()` with variable paths
- Evidence of code injection vulnerabilities

**Action:** Request source code review from maintainer or reject entirely.

### 🟡 CAUTION → QUARANTINE
**Verdict:** Review before installation.

Detected patterns:
- `child_process` calls (spawning external commands)
- Environment variable access (potential secret theft)
- Network calls to unknown domains
- Obfuscated/minified code
- Low-level socket access (net, dgram)
- Encoded strings (hex/Unicode escapes)

**Action:** Examine findings, ask maintainer about suspicious patterns, install with caution.

### 🟢 SAFE → INSTALL
**Verdict:** No obvious malicious patterns detected.

**Action:** Safe to install. Standard security practices still recommended (keep updated, monitor permissions).

## What It Detects

### Code Execution (Highest Risk)
- ✗ `eval()`
- ✗ `exec()`
- ✗ Dynamic `require()` with variable paths
- ⚠ `child_process` module imports

### Credential Theft
- ✗ `process.env.SECRET`, `process.env.API_KEY`, etc.
- ⚠ Dynamic environment variable access `process.env[varName]`
- ⚠ `fs.readFileSync()` on sensitive system files (`/etc/`, `~/`)

### Network/Data Exfiltration
- ⚠ Network calls to unknown external domains (via `fetch`, `http.get`, etc.)
- ⚠ HTTP/HTTPS module imports (potential network calls)
- ⚠ Low-level socket access (`net`, `dgram`)

### Obfuscation (Red Flag)
- ⚠ Minified code (unusually high symbol density, very short lines)
- ⚠ Hex-encoded strings (`\x41\x42\x43`)
- ⚠ Unicode-encoded strings (`\u0041\u0042`)

**Why it matters:** Obfuscated code hides malicious logic. Legitimate libraries don't need to be obfuscated.

## Output Formats

### Text (Human-Readable, Default)

```
=== Security Scanner Report ===

Target: ./my-skill
Files Scanned: 5
Findings: 2

Risk Level: CAUTION

Detailed Findings:

  scripts/handler.js
    Line 42: [CAUTION] child_process allows spawning external commands
      Code: require('child_process')
      Context: const spawn = require('child_process').spawn;

  src/api.js
    Line 18: [CAUTION] Network call to external domain
      Code: fetch('https://api.example.com/verify')
      Context: return fetch('https://api.example.com/verify', {...})

Recommendation:
  Action: QUARANTINE
  Reason: Code contains potentially suspicious patterns requiring review
  Details: Review findings before installation. Consider asking maintainer about specific suspicious patterns.

Suggested Fixes:
  • Replace dynamic require with static import
    File: scripts/handler.js:42
    Suggestion: Use static imports or a whitelist of allowed modules
    Difficulty: MEDIUM
```

### JSON (Programmatic)

```bash
scanner --output json
```

Returns structured JSON with:
- `target`: Path/name scanned
- `timestamp`: ISO timestamp
- `riskLevel`: SAFE | CAUTION | DANGEROUS
- `findings[]`: Array of detected issues with line numbers
- `scannedFiles[]`: List of files analyzed
- `recommendation`: Action and reasoning
- `fixes[]`: (if `--fix` used) Suggested code changes

## Using It in Your Workflow

### Pre-Installation Check

```bash
# Before installing a new skill
security-scanner ~/downloads/mystery-skill/

# If DANGEROUS → Don't install
# If CAUTION → Review output, ask author
# If SAFE → Good to go
```

### Code Review

```bash
# Check your own skill for issues
security-scanner ./my-skill/ --output json > security-report.json

# Fix issues
security-scanner ./my-skill/ --fix
```

### Automated CI/CD

```bash
# In your build pipeline - fail if DANGEROUS detected
security-scanner ./src/ --output json
if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
  echo "Security violations found"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Sub-Agent Invocation

```bash
# From a sub-agent or CLI
/Users/ericwoodard/clawd/security-scanner-skill/scripts/scanner.js ~/clawd/some-skill/
```

## Common Findings & How to Interpret

### eval() / exec()
**Finding:** "eval() allows arbitrary code execution"

**Interpretation:** Code can run any arbitrary JavaScript at runtime. Extremely dangerous.

**Response:** 
- ❌ If malicious: REJECT
- ⚠️ If legitimate: Ask author why eval is needed (usually there's a safer way)

### child_process Import
**Finding:** "child_process allows spawning external commands"

**Interpretation:** Code can run system commands. Used legitimately by build tools, but also by malware.

**Response:**
- Check where it's used
- Does it run user input? → DANGEROUS
- Does it run hardcoded commands? → Probably safe, but review

### process.env.API_KEY
**Finding:** "Accessing sensitive environment variables"

**Interpretation:** Code reads secret keys from environment. This is standard, but verify:
- Is it documented?
- Is the key actually used for intended purpose?
- Could it be exfiltrated?

**Response:**
- Normal for legitimate skills that need API keys
- Check if the API call goes to the expected domain

### Minified Code
**Finding:** "Code appears to be minified or obfuscated"

**Interpretation:** Source code is intentionally hidden. Why?

**Response:**
- ❌ Single-file skill that's minified → Suspicious, ask for source
- ✅ Node module with both `.js` and `.min.js` → Standard practice
- ⚠️ Hex-encoded strings → Request deobfuscation

### Fetch to Unknown Domain
**Finding:** "Network call to external domain"

**Interpretation:** Code calls some external API. Is it expected?

**Response:**
- ✅ `fetch('https://api.github.com/...')` → Normal
- ❌ `fetch('https://malware-collection.ru/...')` → Dangerous
- ⚠️ `fetch(userProvidedUrl)` → Dangerous (open redirect)

## How to Use with Sub-Agents

From a sub-agent, invoke the scanner:

```bash
# Run scan
/Users/ericwoodard/clawd/security-scanner-skill/scripts/scanner.js <skill-path>

# Check exit code
if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
  # DANGEROUS - handle rejection
elif [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  # CAUTION - handle quarantine
else
  # SAFE
fi

# Or parse JSON output
result=$(/Users/ericwoodard/clawd/security-scanner-skill/scripts/scanner.js <path> --output json)
riskLevel=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.riskLevel')
```

## Limitations

⚠️ **Static analysis only** - Does not execute code, so:
- Runtime tricks might not be detected
- Obfuscated strings that are decoded at runtime won't be flagged
- Complex control flow analysis not performed

**Still safe:** Unless the scanner says DANGEROUS, you should be fine. CAUTION requires manual review but many are false positives.

## Commands

### `security-scanner <path>`
Scan a file or directory.

```bash
security-scanner ./my-skill/
security-scanner ./code.js
```

### `security-scanner --code "<snippet>"`
Scan inline code without creating a file.

```bash
security-scanner --code "eval(userInput)"
```

### `security-scanner <path> --output json`
Output results as JSON for programmatic parsing.

```bash
security-scanner ./skill --output json > report.json
```

### `security-scanner <path> --output text`
Output as human-readable text (default).

### `security-scanner <path> --fix`
Show suggested code fixes and mitigation strategies.

```bash
security-scanner ./skill --fix
```

### `security-scanner --help`
Show usage information.

## Exit Codes

- `0` - SAFE (no dangerous patterns)
- `1` - CAUTION (suspicious patterns found, manual review needed)
- `2` - DANGEROUS (malicious patterns detected, do not install)

## Implementation Notes

- Pattern matching via regular expressions
- Obfuscation detection via heuristics (symbol density, encoding)
- Line-accurate reporting (can pinpoint exact locations)
- Multi-language support (.js, .ts, .py, .go, .java, .rb, .php, .sh)
- Automatic filtering of non-code directories (node_modules, .git, dist, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Semantic analysis (understand variable data flow)
- Signature-based detection (known malware patterns)
- Configuration audit (unusual permissions, suspicious settings)
- Quarantine mode (automatically remove/comment suspicious code)
- Integration with malware databases
- Supply chain attack detection (pinning specific versions, checksum verification)
