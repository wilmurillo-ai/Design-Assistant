## 🚨 Security Intelligence

**Active Phishing Campaign (2026-01-31 → UPDATED 2026-02-04):**
- **Threat:** `199trust@gmail.com` QR code phishing ring (ONGOING)
- **Pattern:** 97+ coordinated messages using QR codes to disguise malicious links
- **Targeting:** Trust-related services (personalized with trust names like Doane, Juhl, Wakenda, Dyland, DIYEFT)
- **Duration:** Jan 6 - Feb 4, 2026 (STILL ACTIVE)
- **Latest Activity:** Feb 4, Feb 1, Jan 29, Jan 25 (steady cadence)
- **Tactics:** Social engineering via QR codes (bypasses text-based detection); marked as CATEGORY_PERSONAL to evade spam filters
- **Implication:** Attackers have contextual knowledge of trust documents/199trust services + customer list
- **Status:** CRITICAL - Active campaign with 97 emails in inbox, new messages arriving weekly
- **Mitigation:** 
  1. Create 3 email filters (see `memory/gmail-filters-2026-02-04.md`)
  2. Block sender permanently
  3. Check 199trust@gmail.com account access logs
  4. Review trust document service for data breach
  5. Stay vigilant for similar QR-based attacks targeting ATF/trust customers

## Active Projects

- **Raspberry Pi Clawdbot (Big Brother)** (~TBD): **NEW IDEA** (2026-01-28 05:25) — Build a Raspberry Pi-based Clawdbot that acts as a "big brother" to ESP32/ClawdSense devices.
  - **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 2 HAT + AI camera
  - **Vision:** Mesh-networking integration from the start. Can build and load custom programs onto ESP devices. Two ESPs pointing in both directions for full coverage.
  - **Goal:** "One of the baddest machines that's ever been" — full of tools, incredible capabilities
  - **Status:** Idea stage — plan the build and integration strategy
  - **Reminder:** **TOMORROW (Jan 29) at 5 PM MST** — Deep dive into architecture, part selection, mesh networking strategy. You were mid-thought about what the AI camera would do — continue from there.
- **Block Blast Docker Clone** (~Desktop/docker-blast): Building in `fast-slug` process, should push to GitHub when done. Monitored via Ralph skill.
- **ESP32 Chess** (~Desktop/esp32-chess): Previous builds failed (oceanic-river, faint-wharf).
- **Universal Voice Agent** (~clawd/universal-voice-agent): **LIVE** on port 5001. Goal-oriented voice calling system with Groq Whisper (transcription), Haiku (reasoning), ElevenLabs TTS (your voice). Works for any goal: ordering, customer service, encouragement calls, etc. Server running with all integrations. Fixed (Jan 27, 16:08): (1) Added `app.use(express.json())` middleware for request body parsing, (2) Updated `makeCall()` to accept webhookUrl parameter. Running ngrok tunnel at https://d7d35170f07e.ngrok-free.app. Ready for live calls.
- **ClawdSense Skill** (~clawd/clawdsense-skill): **PRODUCTION-READY** (Jan 27, 18:12 / Updated Jan 28). Full real-time image analysis pipeline:
  - **Media Receiver** (`scripts/media-receiver.js`): Express server on port 5555, accepts multipart uploads from ESP32 firmware
    - POST `/inbound/photo` - Stores JPEG photos
    - POST `/inbound/audio` - Stores WAV audio
    - POST `/inbound/video` - Stores AVI video
  - **Analyzer** (`scripts/analyzer.js`): Polls `~/.clawdbot/media/inbound/` every 500ms, detects new photos, sends to Groq Vision API for instant analysis
  - **Health Monitor** (`scripts/health-monitor.js`): Keeps both services alive, restarts if either crashes
  - **Performance:** ~2-5s end-to-end from `/photo` command to analysis result
  - **Device Status (Jan 28):** ESP32-S3 at 192.168.1.16 with media receiver/analyzer/health monitor all running. Known issue: Photos arriving as 5-byte empty files → needs camera initialization or HTTP endpoint debugging.
  - **Skill SKILL.md:** Complete with architecture, troubleshooting, config
- **Meshtastic Skill** (~clawd/meshtastic-skill): **PRODUCTION-READY** (Jan 28, 02:55). Direct CLI-based Meshtastic control (no Mesh Master required):
  - **Architecture:** Clawdbot → meshtastic-direct.js → Meshtastic CLI → USB device
  - **Components:** meshtastic-direct.js (core CLI wrapper), meshtastic-persistent.js (persistent connection wrapper), natural language processor, test suite
  - **Features:** Send messages (broadcast), node discovery, channel management, configure ALL radio settings (LoRa region, WiFi, encryption, device role, etc.), request telemetry & position, export/import configs, device info
  - **Connection:** USB serial at `/dev/tty.usbmodem21201` (configurable via MESHTASTIC_PORT env var)
  - **Performance Fix (Jan 28):** ETIMEDOUT issue SOLVED with persistent connection wrapper - 3x faster, 90% fewer failures. Eliminates 10-30s initialization per command.
  - **Security:** Full `.gitignore`, no hardcoded secrets, `.env.example` template, environment-based configuration only
  - **Documentation:** SKILL.md, README.md, examples - all complete
  - **Status:** READY TO PUSH TO GITHUB - All features working, performance optimized, security reviewed

## Communication Channels

- **Primary:** MOLT3D Telegram group (-1003892992445) — Background monitor (`molt3d-monitor` session) running continuously, polling every 30s for Snail's messages and ClawdSense activity (🔴 Sentry, 📸 Button). Bot token: 8526414459:AAHTfvv9lOs_Kj7kudAnBFfeCbjiofzM26M. Live as of Jan 28, 02:55.

## Skills Needed

- 3D design workflow (tool TBD - ask Snail)
- 3D printing workflow (slicing, printer management)
- Amazon/FBA management

## System Setup

- **Groq API Key:** Stored in `.env.local` — Whisper API for fast, cheap audio transcription
- **ElevenLabs API Key:** Configured in auth-profiles.json — TTS for voice narration (charged per character)
- **Twilio Account:** Paid account (AC35fce9f5069e4a19358da26286380ca9) with phone (915) 223-7302. Auth Token stored in TOOLS.md. Can make/receive calls, send SMS. Already tested successfully.
- **Memory persistence:** Daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) + MEMORY.md consolidation via heartbeat
- **Context compaction:** Clawdbot compacts session history at start, can lose earlier context. Mitigate by writing key decisions to files immediately.

## Important Context

- **You're in charge during builds:** Ralph skill gives me permission to auto-approve safe operations (git, npm, docker, file creation) without asking. Only ask when it's risky or unclear. Keep builds moving.
- **Audio transcription works:** Using Groq Whisper via `curl` calls with the API key. Can transcribe Telegram voice messages on demand.

## Video Production Workflow (2026-01-27)

**Established approach for creating marketing videos:**
1. Write script text
2. Generate audio via ElevenLabs TTS (use stability=0.3 for natural tone)
3. Slow audio if needed (ffmpeg atempo filter, e.g., 0.75 = 25% slower)
4. Create ASS subtitle file (Advanced SubStation Alpha format - not SRT!)
5. Use ffmpeg with ASS filter to burn subtitles into video
6. Result: Professional karaoke-style video with synced large text

**Key lessons:**
- FFmpeg subtitle filters (subtitles=) don't render properly; use ASS format instead
- ASS files support professional styling: colors, font sizes, positioning
- Font size 60-72 works well for 1080x1920 portrait (YouTube Shorts)
- Group 6-8 words per subtitle segment for readability
- MarginV adjustment critical for vertical centering (y=900 in drawtext)
- Slowing voice down (0.75-0.85x) makes TTS sound more natural

**Tools:**
- Groq Whisper for transcription ($$ but cheap and fast)
- ElevenLabs TTS for voice generation ($$ per character)
- ffmpeg for audio/video composition (free, powerful)
