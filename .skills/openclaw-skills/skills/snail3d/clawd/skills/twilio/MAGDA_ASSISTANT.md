# 🤖 SMS Assistant for Magda

Your wife can text your Twilio number and I'll take actions on your behalf — add calendar events, create tasks, send you notes, and more.

## What Magda Can Do

### 📅 Add to Calendar
```
"Add to calendar: Dinner with parents Friday at 7pm"
"Schedule dentist appointment tomorrow at 2pm"
"Remind Eric about the meeting on Monday at 9am"
```

### ✅ Create Tasks
```
"Add task: Pick up milk on the way home"
"Tell Eric to call mom tomorrow"
"Remind Eric to submit the report by Friday"
```

### 📝 Send Notes
```
"Tell Eric the package arrived"
"Let Eric know I'm running late"
"Remind Eric we need diapers"
```

## How It Works

```
Magda sends SMS
      ↓
Twilio receives it
      ↓
Webhook server processes it
      ↓
SMS Assistant parses the intent
      ↓
Action executed (calendar, task, note)
      ↓
Confirmation sent back to Magda
      ↓
You get notified in Telegram
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Webhook Server

```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/twilio
source .venv/bin/activate
python webhook_server.py 5000
```

### 2. Expose to Internet

**Using ngrok:**
```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

**Using Tailscale:**
```bash
tailscale funnel 5000
```

### 3. Configure Twilio

1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/active)
2. Click your number: **(915) 223-7302**
3. Under **Messaging**:
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://your-ngrok-url/sms`
   - **HTTP Method**: POST
4. Save

### 4. Authorize Magda

Edit `sms_assistant.py` and add her number:

```python
ALLOWED_SENDERS = ["+19153097085"]  # Already done!
```

### 5. Test It

Have Magda text: *"Add to calendar: Test event tomorrow at 3pm"*

She should get back: *"✅ Added 'Test event' to Eric's calendar on 2025-02-04 at 15:00"*

## Viewing Actions & Notifications

### Check Notifications
```bash
python view_notifications.py
```

Shows you:
- What Magda requested

- Any pending confirmations

### View Pending Actions
```bash
python view_notifications.py --pending
```

### View All Notes

## Safety Features

✅ **Authorized Senders Only** — Only Magda's number is allowed  
✅ **Confirmation Mode** — Calendar/tasks saved for your confirmation if automation fails  
✅ **Audit Trail** — Everything logged for you to review  
✅ **Reply Confirmations** — Magda knows if something worked or needs your OK  

## Customization

### Add More Family Members

Edit `sms_assistant.py`:

```python
ALLOWED_SENDERS = [
    "+19153097085",  # Magda
    "+19155551234",  # Your mom
    "+19155555678",  # Your dad
]
```

### Auto-Confirm vs Manual Mode

```python
# In sms_assistant.py

# This mode asks you before executing:
DELEGATION_MODE = "confirm"

# This mode just does it:
DELEGATION_MODE = "auto"
```

### Custom Actions

Add new command types in `sms_assistant.py`:

```python
# In parse() method
if "check weather" in self.message:
    return {"type": "weather", "location": "El Paso"}

# In ActionExecutor.execute()
if cmd_type == "weather":
    return self.check_weather(cmd, sender)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Sorry, I'm not authorized..."
- Check `ALLOWED_SENDERS` has the right number
- Make sure number format is `+1XXXXXXXXXX`

### Actions not working
- Check `pending_actions.json` — they may be saved for confirmation
- Run `view_notifications.py` to see what happened
- Check webhook server console for errors

### Calendar not adding events
- Make sure `gog` CLI is installed and configured
- May need to save to pending instead

### Tasks not creating
- Make sure `things` CLI is available
- Falls back to pending if Things isn't working

### Webhook not receiving messages
- Ensure ngrok/tailscale is running
- Check Twilio webhook URL is correct
- Verify the server is running on the right port

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Real-time Telegram notifications (instead of log file)
- [ ] Voice call confirmations ("Eric, Magda wants to add X to your calendar, approve?")
- [ ] Smart home integration ("Turn off the lights", "Set thermostat to 72")
- [ ] Shopping list ("Add milk to the shopping list")
- [ ] Location sharing ("Where is Eric?" → checks Find My/calendar)

## Security

- Only whitelisted numbers can trigger actions
- All actions logged for review
- Sensitive credentials in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in code
