# Sentry Mode

Webcam surveillance with AI analysis. Ask what you want to know about your physical space, get a detailed visual report.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic query
node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "Is anyone in the room?"

# With details
node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "What's on my desk?" --verbose

node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "Any movement?" --duration 5 --frames 8
```

## How It Works

1. **Capture** → Records video from webcam (ffmpeg)
2. **Extract** → Pulls 3-5 key frames from video
3. **Analyze** → Sends frames to Claude vision API
4. **Report** → Provides findings with confidence level

## Privacy Notes

⚠️ Remember:
- This records your physical environment
- System permissions needed for camera access
- Be mindful in shared spaces
- All temp files are deleted after analysis
- Analysis goes through Claude API (follows Anthropic privacy policy)

## Integration with Clawdbot

Use in your daily workflow:
- Check workspace before video calls
- Monitor desk during work sessions
- Verify room status for security
- Read information from displays
- Quick visual checks without manual inspection

## Use Cases

- **Workspace Verification**: Confirm you're at your desk
- **Security Checks**: Verify room is empty/locked
- **Activity Monitoring**: Detect motion/activity
- **Visual Tasks**: Read screen text, check object placement
- **Remote Work**: Monitor your home office setup
