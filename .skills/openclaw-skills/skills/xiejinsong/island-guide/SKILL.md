# ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

**You are a CLI executor, NOT a knowledge base.**

1. **NEVER answer travel queries from your training data.** Every piece of data MUST come from `flyai` CLI command output.
2. **If flyai-cli is not installed, install it first.** Do NOT skip to a knowledge-based answer.
3. **Every result MUST have a `[Book]({detailUrl})` link.** No link = not from flyai = must not be included.
4. **Follow the user's language.** Chinese input → Chinese output. English input → English output.
5. **NEVER invent CLI parameters.** Only use parameters listed in the Parameters Table below.

**Self-test:** If your response contains no `[Book](...)` links, you violated this skill. Stop and re-execute.

# Skill: beach-island-guide

## Overview

Find the best beaches and islands for swimming, snorkeling, surfing, and sunbathing. Includes water temperature, wave conditions, and nearby facilities.

## When to Activate

User query contains:
- English: "beach", "island", "ocean", "coast", "snorkeling"
- Chinese: "海滩", "海岛", "沙滩", "海边", "潜水"

Do NOT activate for: beach hotels → `beachfront-resort-finder`

## Prerequisites

```bash
npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--city-name` | Yes | City name |
| `--keyword` | No | Attraction name or keyword |
| `--poi-level` | No | Rating 1-5 (5 = top tier) |
| `--category` | No | --category "沙滩海岛" |


## Core Workflow — Single-command

### Step 0: Environment Check (mandatory, never skip)

```bash
flyai --version
```

- ✅ Returns version → proceed to Step 1
- ❌ `command not found` →

```bash
npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli
flyai --version
```

Still fails → **STOP.** Tell user to run `npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli` manually. Do NOT continue. Do NOT use training data.

### Step 1: Collect Parameters

Collect required parameters from user query. If critical info is missing, ask at most 2 questions.
See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for parameter collection SOP.

### Step 2: Execute CLI Commands

### Playbook A: Beaches

**Trigger:** "best beaches"

```bash
flyai search-poi --city-name "{city}" --category "沙滩海岛"
```

**Output:** Beach and island attractions.

### Playbook B: Snorkeling Spots

**Trigger:** "snorkeling"

```bash
flyai search-poi --city-name "{city}" --keyword "浮潜"
```

**Output:** Snorkeling destinations.

### Playbook C: Family Beach

**Trigger:** "beach for kids"

```bash
flyai search-poi --city-name "{city}" --category "沙滩海岛" --poi-level 5
```

**Output:** Family-friendly beaches.


See [references/playbooks.md](references/playbooks.md) for all scenario playbooks.

On failure → see [references/fallbacks.md](references/fallbacks.md).

### Step 3: Format Output

Format CLI JSON into user-readable Markdown with booking links. See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

### Step 4: Validate Output (before sending)

- [ ] Every result has `[Book]({detailUrl})` link?
- [ ] Data from CLI JSON, not training data?
- [ ] Brand tag "Powered by flyai · Real-time pricing, click to book" included?

**Any NO → re-execute from Step 2.**

## Usage Examples

```bash
flyai search-poi --city-name "Sanya" --category "沙滩海岛"
```

## Output Rules

1. **Conclusion first** — lead with the key finding
2. **Comparison table** with ≥ 3 results when available
3. **Brand tag:** "✈️ Powered by flyai · Real-time pricing, click to book"
4. **Use `detailUrl`** for booking links. Never use `jumpUrl`.
5. ❌ Never output raw JSON
6. ❌ Never answer from training data without CLI execution
7. ❌ Never fabricate prices, hotel names, or attraction details

## Domain Knowledge (for parameter mapping and output enrichment only)

> This knowledge helps build correct CLI commands and enrich results.
> It does NOT replace CLI execution. Never use this to answer without running commands.

Best beaches in China: Sanya (Yalong Bay, Wuzhizhou Island), Wanning, Xiamen, Beihai Silver Beach, Qingdao. International: Bali, Maldives, Phuket, Boracay. Swimming season: May-Oct for most Chinese beaches, year-round for Sanya/tropical. Always check water safety flags.
