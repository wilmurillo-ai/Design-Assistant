# ClawdTalk

> ⚠️ **First time setup?** Read `SETUP.md` in this directory before anything else. It walks you through the complete configuration flow step by step.

Voice calling, SMS messaging, and AI Missions for Clawdbot. Call your bot by phone, send texts, or run autonomous multi-step outreach campaigns — powered by ClawdTalk.

> **Trust:** By using this skill, voice transcripts, SMS messages, and mission data are sent to clawdtalk.com (operated by Telnyx). Only install if you trust this service with your conversation data.

## External Endpoints

| Endpoint | Used by | Data sent |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `https://clawdtalk.com` (WebSocket) | `ws-client.js` | Voice transcripts, tool results, conversation state |
| `https://clawdtalk.com/v1/*` | `telnyx_api.py` | Mission state, events, scheduled calls/SMS, assistant configs |
| `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` | `ws-client.js` | Transcribed speech (local gateway only) |
| `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/team-telnyx/clawdtalk-client/...` | `update.sh` | None (download only) |

## Security & Privacy

- Voice transcripts and SMS content are transmitted to clawdtalk.com.
- Mission state and events are stored server-side for tracking and insights.
- `setup.sh` reads gateway config to extract connection details; with confirmation it adds `sessions_send` to `gateway.tools.allow`.
- API key is stored in `skill-config.json` — use env var `CLAWDTALK_API_KEY` or a `${CLAWDTALK_API_KEY}` reference to avoid plaintext storage.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: SLUG CONSISTENCY

`init` auto-generates a slug from the mission name (lowercased, spaces → hyphens).
**Every command that takes a slug (`setup-agent`, `save-memory`, `complete`) MUST use the EXACT same slug.**

Mismatched slugs = agent not linked = scheduled events invisible on the frontend.

```bash
# After init, ALWAYS confirm the slug:
python scripts/telnyx_api.py list-state
# Output: find-window-washing-contractors: Find window washing contractors [running]
#         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ COPY-PASTE THIS. NEVER ABBREVIATE.
```

---

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: YOU OWN THE MISSION LIFECYCLE

**The server does NOT automatically update plan steps or mission status.** That is YOUR job as the bot. If you don't update steps and complete the mission, the UI will show "Running" forever with all steps "Pending".

## Your Responsibilities

For every mission, YOU must:
1. **Update plan steps** — mark each step `in_progress` → `completed` (or `failed`)
2. **Log events** — after every significant action
3. **Poll for completion** — check if scheduled calls/SMS finished
4. **Complete the mission** — mark the run as `succeeded` or `failed`
5. **Clean up** — remove any polling cron jobs when the mission ends

The UI reflects exactly what you tell it. No updates from you = no updates on screen.

---

# 🚨 MANDATORY: SAVE TO MEMORY AFTER EVERY ACTION

**Every significant action MUST be persisted using `save-memory` or `append-memory` IMMEDIATELY after the action succeeds.** The frontend reads from server memory. If you don't save it, it doesn't show up. `log-event` alone is NOT enough.

> **Rule: If you did something, save it to memory. No exceptions. No "I'll do it later." Do it NOW.**

Example (scheduling an SMS):
```bash
# 1. Schedule it
python scripts/telnyx_api.py schedule-sms $AID "$TO" "$FROM" "$DATETIME" "$MESSAGE" $MID $RID $STEP_ID

# 2. IMMEDIATELY save to memory
python scripts/telnyx_api.py append-memory "$SLUG" "scheduled_events" \
  '{"event_id": "<id>", "type": "sms", "to": "<to>", "message": "<msg>", "scheduled_at": "<dt>", "step_id": "<step>"}'

# 3. Then log the event
python scripts/telnyx_api.py log-event $MID $RID custom "Scheduled SMS event_id=<id>" $STEP_ID
```

**Skipping step 2 is the #1 cause of "nothing shows on the frontend" bugs.**

---

# 🚨 MANDATORY: CHECK MISSION STATUS AFTER EVERY STEP

**After completing or failing ANY step, you MUST check whether the mission should be completed or failed.** Never leave a mission in "running" state when it's actually done or dead.

> **Rule: After every step change, ask yourself: is this mission finished?**

### Decision tree (run after EVERY step):

```
Step finished →
  ├── Succeeded?
  │     ├── All steps done? → COMPLETE MISSION (update-run succeeded)
  │     ├── More steps remain? → Continue to next step
  │     └── Only verify left? → Set up polling cron
  └── Failed?
        ├── Recoverable (retry/reschedule)? → Retry
        └── Unrecoverable? → FAIL MISSION NOW:
              1. update-step <step_id> failed
              2. log-event error "Failed: <reason>" <step_id>
              3. save-memory "$SLUG" "error_<step_id>" '{"error": "...", "recoverable": false}'
              4. update-run $MID $RID failed
              5. save-memory "$SLUG" "result" '{"status": "failed", "reason": "...", "failed_step": "..."}'
              6. Clean up any polling cron jobs
```

**A mission stuck in "running" when it's actually done or dead is a bug. The user sees it and thinks work is still happening.**

```

- **telnyx_api.py** — Python CLI script. Every command you run goes through this. It talks to the ClawdTalk server, never directly to Telnyx.
- **ClawdTalk Server** — Node.js backend. Stores missions, assistants, and events in a local Postgres DB. Proxies requests to the Telnyx API.
- **Telnyx API** — Cloud service. Actually makes the calls and sends the SMS at the scheduled time.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/telnyx_api.py` | CLI tool for all mission/assistant/event operations |
| `scripts/connect.sh` | WebSocket client for inbound voice call routing |
| `skill-config.json` | API key and server URL |
| `.missions_state.json` | Local state tracking for active missions |
| `.connect.log` | WebSocket connection logs |

## Two Sets of IDs

Every entity exists in two places with different IDs:
- **Local DB ID** — what the ClawdTalk server returns (e.g. `3df24dde-...`)
- **Telnyx ID** — what the Telnyx API uses internally

The script always works with local IDs. You don't need to worry about Telnyx IDs.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Sign up** at [clawdtalk.com](https://clawdtalk.com)
2. **Add your phone** in Settings
3. **Get API key** from Dashboard
4. **Run setup**: `./setup.sh`
   > `setup.sh` reads your gateway config to extract connection details and (with confirmation) adds `sessions_send` to `gateway.tools.allow`. Gateway config is at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` or `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`.
5. **Start connection**: `./scripts/connect.sh start`

## Voice Calls

The WebSocket client routes calls to your gateway's main agent session, giving full access to memory, tools, and context.

```bash
./scripts/connect.sh start     # Start connection
./scripts/connect.sh stop      # Stop
./scripts/connect.sh status    # Check status
```

### Outbound Calls

Have the bot call you or others:

```bash
./scripts/call.sh                              # Call your phone
./scripts/call.sh "Hey, what's up?"            # Call with greeting
./scripts/call.sh --to +15551234567            # Call external number*
./scripts/call.sh --to +15551234567 "Hello!"   # External with greeting
./scripts/call.sh status <call_id>             # Check call status
./scripts/call.sh end <call_id>                # End call
```

*External calls require a paid account with a dedicated number. The AI will operate in privacy mode when calling external numbers (won't reveal your private info).

## SMS

Send and receive text messages:

```bash
./scripts/sms.sh send +15551234567 "Hello!"
./scripts/sms.sh list
./scripts/sms.sh conversations
```

## AI Missions (Full Tracking via Python)

For complex, multi-step missions with full tracking, state persistence, retries, and conversation insights, use the Python-based missions API.

**Required**: Python 3.7+, `CLAWDTALK_API_KEY` environment variable. Optionally set `CLAWDTALK_API_URL` to override the default endpoint (defaults to `https://clawdtalk.com/v1`).

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py check-key    # Verify setup
```

# CRITICAL: SAVE STATE FREQUENTLY

**You MUST save your progress after EVERY significant action.** If the session crashes or restarts, unsaved work is LOST.

## Two-Layer Persistence: Memory + Events

Always save to BOTH:
1. **Local Memory** (`.missions_state.json`) - Fast, survives restarts
2. **Events API** (cloud) - Permanent audit trail, survives local file loss

## When to Save (After EVERY action!)

| Action | Save Memory | Log Event |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Web search returns results | append-memory | log-event (tool_call) |
| Found a contractor/lead | append-memory | log-event (custom) |
| Created assistant | save-memory | log-event (custom) |
| Assigned phone number | save-memory | log-event (custom) |
| Scheduled a call/SMS | append-memory | log-event (custom) |
| Call completed | save-memory | log-event (custom) |
| Got quote/insight | save-memory | log-event (custom) |
| Made a decision | save-memory | log-event (message) |
| Step started | save-memory | update-step (in_progress) + log-event (step_started) |
| Step completed | save-memory | update-step (completed) + log-event (step_completed) |
| Step failed | save-memory | update-step (failed) + log-event (error) |
| Error occurred | save-memory | log-event (error) |

## Memory Commands (Local Backup)

```bash
# Save a single value
python scripts/telnyx_api.py save-memory "<slug>" "key" '{"data": "value"}'

# Append to a list (great for collecting multiple items)
python scripts/telnyx_api.py append-memory "<slug>" "contractors" '{"name": "ABC Co", "phone": "+1234567890"}'

# Retrieve memory
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-memory "<slug>"           # Get all memory
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-memory "<slug>" "key"     # Get specific key
```

## Event Commands (Cloud Backup)

```bash
# Log an event (step_id is REQUIRED - links event to a plan step)
python scripts/telnyx_api.py log-event <mission_id> <run_id> <type> "<summary>" <step_id> '[payload_json]'

# Event types: tool_call, custom, message, error, step_started, step_completed
# step_id: Use the step_id from your plan (e.g., "research", "setup", "calls")
#          Use "-" if event doesn't belong to a specific step
```

## When to Use Missions

This skill has two modes: **full missions** (tracked, multi-step) and **simple calls** (one-off, no mission overhead). Pick the right one.

### Use a Full Mission When:
- The task involves **multiple calls or SMS** (batch outreach, surveys, sweeps)
- You need a **complete audit trail** with events, plans, and state tracking
- The task is **multi-step** and takes significant effort across phases
- **Retries and failure tracking** matter
- You need to **compare results** across multiple calls

Examples:
- "Find me window washing contractors in Chicago, call them and negotiate rates"
- "Contact all leads in this list and schedule demos"
- "Call 10 weather stations and find the hottest one"

### Do NOT Use a Mission When:
- The task is a **single outbound call** — just create an assistant (or reuse one) and schedule the call directly
- It's a **one-off SMS** — schedule it and done
- The task doesn't need tracking, plans, or state recovery
- You'd be creating a mission with one step and one call — that's overengineering

**For simple calls, just:**
```bash
# Reuse or create an assistant
python scripts/telnyx_api.py list-assistants --name=<relevant>
# Schedule the call
python scripts/telnyx_api.py schedule-call <assistant_id> <to> <from> <datetime> <mission_id> <run_id>
# Poll for completion
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-event <assistant_id> <event_id>
# Get insights
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-insights <conversation_id>
```

No mission, no run, no plan. Keep it simple.

## State Persistence

The script automatically manages state in `.missions_state.json`. This survives restarts and supports multiple concurrent missions.

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py list-state                              # List all active missions
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-state "find-window-washing-contractors"  # Get state for specific mission
python scripts/telnyx_api.py remove-state "find-window-washing-contractors" # Remove mission from state
```

---

# Core Workflow

## Phase 1: Initialize Tracking

### Step 1.1: Create a Mission

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py create-mission "Brief descriptive name" "Full description of the task"
```

**Save the returned `mission_id`** - you'll need it for all subsequent calls.

### Step 1.2: Start a Run

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py create-run <mission_id> '{"original_request": "The exact user request", "context": "Any relevant context"}'
```

**Save the returned `run_id`**.

### Step 1.3: Create a Plan

Before executing, outline your plan:

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py create-plan <mission_id> <run_id> '[
  {"step_id": "step_1", "description": "Research contractors online", "sequence": 1},
  {"step_id": "step_2", "description": "Create voice agent for calls", "sequence": 2},
  {"step_id": "step_3", "description": "Schedule calls to each contractor", "sequence": 3},
  {"step_id": "step_4", "description": "Monitor call completions", "sequence": 4},
  {"step_id": "step_5", "description": "Analyze results and select best options", "sequence": 5}
]'
```

### Step 1.4: Set Run to Running

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py update-run <mission_id> <run_id> running
```

### High-Level Alternative: Initialize Everything at Once

Use the `init` command to create mission, run, plan, and set status in one step:

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py init "Find window washing contractors" "Find contractors in Chicago, call them, negotiate rates" "User wants window washing quotes" '[
  {"step_id": "research", "description": "Find contractors online", "sequence": 1},
  {"step_id": "setup", "description": "Create voice agent", "sequence": 2},
  {"step_id": "calls", "description": "Schedule and make calls", "sequence": 3},
  {"step_id": "analyze", "description": "Analyze results", "sequence": 4}
]'
```

This also automatically resumes if a mission with the same name already exists.

**⚠️ Immediately after `init`, run `list-state` and copy the exact slug. Use it for ALL subsequent commands.**

---

## Phase 2: Voice/SMS Agent Setup

When your task requires making calls or sending SMS, create an AI assistant first.

### Step 2.1: Create a Voice/SMS Assistant

**For phone calls:**
```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py create-assistant "Contractor Outreach Agent" "You are calling on behalf of [COMPANY]. Your goal is to [SPECIFIC GOAL]. Be professional and concise. Collect: [WHAT TO COLLECT]. If they cannot talk now, ask for a good callback time." "Hi, this is an AI assistant calling on behalf of [COMPANY]. Is this [BUSINESS NAME]? I am calling to inquire about your services. Do you have a moment?" '["telephony", "messaging"]'
```

**For SMS:**
```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py create-assistant "SMS Outreach Agent" "You send SMS messages to collect information. Keep messages brief and professional." "Hi! I am reaching out on behalf of [COMPANY] regarding [PURPOSE]. Could you please reply with [REQUESTED INFO]?" '["telephony", "messaging"]'
```

**Save the returned `assistant_id`**.

### Step 2.2: Find and Assign a Phone Number

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-available-phone                          # Get first available
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-connection-id <assistant_id> telephony   # Get connection ID
python scripts/telnyx_api.py assign-phone <phone_number_id> <connection_id> voice  # Assign
```

### High-Level Alternative: Setup Agent in One Step

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py setup-agent "find-window-washing-contractors" "Contractor Caller" "You are calling to get quotes for commercial window washing. Ask about: rates per floor, availability, insurance. Be professional." "Hi, I am calling to inquire about your commercial window washing services. Do you have a moment to discuss rates?"
```

This automatically creates the assistant, links it to the mission run, finds an available phone number, assigns it, and saves all IDs to the state file.

**⚠️ The slug MUST match what `init` created. If it doesn't, the agent won't be linked and scheduled events won't appear on the frontend.**

**Verify linking worked immediately after:**
```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py list-linked-agents <mission_id> <run_id>
# Must show your assistant_id. If empty → slug was wrong. Fix with:
python scripts/telnyx_api.py link-agent <mission_id> <run_id> <assistant_id>
```

### Step 2.3: Link Agent to Mission Run

**If using `setup-agent`**: Linking is done automatically (only if slug matches `init`).

**If setting up manually**:
```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py link-agent <mission_id> <run_id> <assistant_id>
python scripts/telnyx_api.py list-linked-agents <mission_id> <run_id>
python scripts/telnyx_api.py unlink-agent <mission_id> <run_id> <assistant_id>
```

---

## Phase 3: Scheduling Calls/SMS

### Business Hours Consideration

**CRITICAL**: Before scheduling calls, consider business hours (9 AM - 5 PM local time). `scheduled_at` must be in the future (at least 1 minute from now).

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py schedule-call <assistant_id> "+15551234567" "+15559876543" "2024-12-01T14:30:00Z" <mission_id> <run_id>
python scripts/telnyx_api.py schedule-sms <assistant_id> "+15551234567" "+15559876543" "2024-12-01T14:30:00Z" "Your message here"
```

**Save the returned event `id`**.

---

## Phase 4: Monitoring Call Completion

### ⚠️ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

After scheduling a call or SMS, **Telnyx executes it autonomously** at the scheduled time. You need to **poll** to find out when it's done, then update the mission accordingly.

### Check Scheduled Event Status

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-event <assistant_id> <event_id>
```

### Use Cron Jobs to Poll

Use your bot's cron system to schedule polling. **Do NOT block the main session waiting.** Match the poll interval to the expected wait time:

| Expected completion | Poll interval | Example |
|---|---|---|
| < 5 minutes | Every 30 seconds | SMS sent 1 min from now |
| 5–30 minutes | Every 2–5 minutes | Call scheduled in 15 min |
| 1–24 hours | Every 15–30 minutes | Call scheduled for tonight |
| Days/weeks | Every 4–8 hours | Call scheduled for next week |

**If you know the exact scheduled time**, don't start polling until after that time. Schedule your first poll for `scheduled_time + 2 minutes`.

### Cron Job Pattern

When you schedule a call/SMS, create a cron job to poll for it:

```
Create cron: poll at appropriate interval
  → Run get-event <assistant_id> <event_id>
  → If completed: update step, log event, complete mission if last step, DELETE THIS CRON
  → If failed: update step as failed, log error, DELETE THIS CRON
  → If pending/in_progress: do nothing, cron runs again at next interval
```

**⚠️ ALWAYS clean up cron jobs when a mission reaches a terminal state (completed, failed, cancelled). Never leave polling crons running after a mission ends.**

### Adjusting Poll Frequency

You can update the cron interval as circumstances change:
- Scheduled for 2 weeks from now? Start with 8-hour polling.
- As the scheduled time approaches (within 1 hour), tighten to 5-minute intervals.
- After the scheduled time passes, tighten to 30-second intervals.

### Event Status Values

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `pending` | Waiting for scheduled time | Keep polling |
| `in_progress` | Call/SMS in progress | Keep polling |
| `completed` | Finished successfully | Update step, get insights if call |
| `failed` | Failed after retries | Update step as failed, consider retry |

### Call Status Values (Phone Calls Only)

| call_status | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| `ringing` | Phone is ringing | Poll again in 1-2 minutes |
| `in-progress` | Call is active | Poll again in 2-3 minutes |
| `completed` | Call finished normally | Get insights |
| `no-answer` | Nobody picked up | **Retryable** — reschedule |
| `busy` | Line is busy | **Retryable** — retry in 10-15 min |
| `canceled` | Call was canceled | Check if intentional |
| `failed` | Network/system error | **Retryable** — retry in 5-10 min |

---

## Phase 5: Getting Conversation Insights

Once a call completes with a `conversation_id`, retrieve insights. **Poll until status is "completed"** (wait 10 seconds between retries).

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py get-insights <conversation_id>
```

Telnyx automatically creates default insight templates when an assistant is created. You don't need to manage these — just read the results.

---

## Phase 6: Complete the Mission

```bash
python scripts/telnyx_api.py update-run <mission_id> <run_id> succeeded

# Or with full results:
python scripts/telnyx_api.py complete "find-window-washing-contractors" <mission_id> <run_id> "Summary of results" '{"key": "payload"}'
```

---

# Event Logging Reference

**Log EVERY action as an event.** Always update step status via `update-step` AND log corresponding events.

```bash
# When STARTING a step:
python scripts/telnyx_api.py update-step "$MISSION_ID" "$RUN_ID" "research" "in_progress"
python scripts/telnyx_api.py log-event "$MISSION_ID" "$RUN_ID" step_started "Starting: Research" "research"

# When COMPLETING a step:
python scripts/telnyx_api.py update-step "$MISSION_ID" "$RUN_ID" "research" "completed"
python scripts/telnyx_api.py log-event "$MISSION_ID" "$RUN_ID" step_completed "Completed: Research" "research"

# When a step FAILS:
python scripts/telnyx_api.py update-step "$MISSION_ID" "$RUN_ID" "calls" "failed"
python scripts/telnyx_api.py log-event "$MISSION_ID" "$RUN_ID" error "Failed: Could not reach contractors" "calls"
```

# Complete Example: SMS Mission with Cron Polling

Here's the full flow for an SMS mission with proper lifecycle tracking and cron-based polling:

# Mission Classes

Not all missions are the same. Identify which class before planning.

```
Does call N depend on results of call N-1?
  YES -> Is it negotiation (leveraging previous results)?
    YES -> Class 3: Sequential Negotiation
    NO  -> Does it have distinct rounds with human approval?
      YES -> Class 4: Multi-Round / Follow-up
      NO  -> Class 5: Information Gathering -> Action
  NO  -> Do you need structured scoring/ranking?
    YES -> Class 2: Parallel Screening with Rubric
    NO  -> Class 1: Parallel Sweep
```

## Class 1: Parallel Sweep
Fan out calls in parallel batches. Same question to many targets. Schedule all calls in one batch (stagger by 1-2 min). Analysis happens after ALL calls complete.

## Class 2: Parallel Screening with Rubric
Fan out calls in parallel with structured scoring criteria. Results are ranked post-hoc via insights.

## Class 3: Sequential Negotiation
Calls MUST run serially. Each call's strategy depends on previous results. Use `update-assistant` between calls to inject context. **Never parallelize these.**

## Class 4: Multi-Round / Follow-up
Two or more distinct phases. Round 1 is broad outreach, human approval gate, then Round 2 targets a subset.

## Class 5: Information Gathering -> Action
Call to find something, then act on it. Early termination when goal is met — cancel remaining calls.

# Operational Guide

## Default Tools
The `send_dtmf` tool is included by default. Most outbound calls hit an IVR first.

## IVR Navigation
Expect IVRs even when calling businesses. Instruct the assistant to press 0 or say 'representative'.

## Call Limits and Throttling
Stagger calls in batches of 5-10, space scheduled times 1-2 minutes apart, monitor for 429 errors.

## Answering Machine Detection (AMD)
- **Enable** for human contacts (leave voicemail or skip machines)
- **Disable** for IVR systems, businesses with phone trees — set action to `continue_assistant`

## Polling for Results: Use Cron Jobs
After scheduling calls, set up a cron job to poll periodically. Don't block the main session.

## Retry Strategy
Track every number's status in mission memory. Retry based on recipient type:
- **Automated systems**: retry in 5-15 min, up to 3 times
- **Service industry**: retry in 30 min - 2 hours, avoid peak hours
- **Professionals**: retry next business day, leave one voicemail max

---

## Approval Requests (Sensitive Actions)

For destructive or sensitive actions during voice calls, request user approval first:

```bash
./scripts/approval.sh request "Delete GitHub repo myproject"
./scripts/approval.sh request "Send $500 to John" --biometric
./scripts/approval.sh request "Post tweet about X" --details "Full text: ..."
```

**When to request approval:**
- Deleting repos, files, or data
- Sending money or making purchases
- Posting to social media
- Sending emails/messages to others
- Any irreversible action

**Response values:**
- `approved` → Execute the action, confirm completion
- `denied` → Tell user "Okay, I won't do that"
- `timeout` → "I didn't get a response, should I try again?"
- `no_devices` → Skip approval, action not executed (no mobile app)

**Example flow in voice call:**
1. User: "Delete my test-repo on GitHub"
2. You: "I'll need your approval for that. Check your phone."
3. Run: `approval.sh request "Delete GitHub repo test-repo"`
4. If approved: Delete the repo, then say "Done, test-repo has been deleted"
5. If denied: "Got it, I won't delete it"

## Gateway Requirements

Voice calls route requests to the main agent via `sessions_send`. This tool is **blocked by default** on the Gateway HTTP tools API. You must explicitly allow it:

```json5
// In openclaw.json → gateway.tools
{
  "gateway": {
    "tools": {
      "allow": ["sessions_send"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or via CLI: `openclaw config patch '{"gateway":{"tools":{"allow":["sessions_send"]}}}'`

Without this, voice calls will connect but the agent won't be able to process any requests (deep tool calls return 404).

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** This MUST go under `gateway.tools.allow`, NOT top-level `tools.allow`. The top-level `tools.allow` is the agent's tool allowlist — putting `sessions_send` there will restrict your agent to ONLY that tool, breaking everything. If you accidentally did this, remove the top-level `tools.allow` entry and restart.

## ❌ Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Different slug for `init` vs `setup-agent` | Scheduled events missing from frontend | `list-state` after `init`, copy-paste slug |
| Forgetting `save-memory` after actions | Frontend shows nothing | Save immediately after every action |
| Not checking mission status after step changes | Mission stuck "running" forever | Run decision tree after every step |
| Leaving polling crons running | Wasted resources, stale polls | Delete cron on any terminal state |
| Not verifying `list-linked-agents` after `setup-agent` | Agent not linked, events invisible | Always verify, fix with `link-agent` |

## Configuration

Edit `skill-config.json`:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `api_key` | API key from clawdtalk.com |
| `server` | Server URL (default: `https://clawdtalk.com`) |
| `owner_name` | Your name (auto-detected from USER.md) |
| `agent_name` | Agent name (auto-detected from IDENTITY.md) |
| `greeting` | Custom greeting for inbound calls |

Environment variables for the Python missions API:
- `CLAWDTALK_API_KEY` — your ClawdTalk API key (required for missions)
- `CLAWDTALK_API_URL` — override the API endpoint (default: `https://clawdtalk.com/v1`)

## Troubleshooting

- **Auth failed**: Regenerate API key at clawdtalk.com
- **Gateway token/port changed**: Re-run `./setup.sh` to update skill-config.json with the new values
- **Empty responses**: Run `./setup.sh` and restart gateway
- **Slow responses**: Try a faster model in your gateway config
- **Debug mode**: `DEBUG=1 ./scripts/connect.sh restart`
- **Missions API key**: Run `python scripts/telnyx_api.py check-key` to verify
- **JSON parsing errors**: Use single quotes around JSON arguments
