# Gate Info Token Onchain Runtime Rules

> Packaged runtime rules for `gate-info-tokenonchain`.
> This file is bundled with the skill so reviewers can audit the required guardrails without depending on files outside this directory.

## 1. Intent and Scope

- Use this skill only for token-level on-chain analysis requests.
- If the user asks for single-address tracking, route to the address tracker skill instead of stretching this one.

## 2. Tool Scope

- Use only the MCP tools documented in `SKILL.md`.
- Do not call undocumented tools, browser flows, or unrelated system tools.

## 3. Installation and Fallback

- This skill requires the Gate Info MCP server.
- If the required MCP tools are unavailable, stop and provide setup guidance or graceful partial output as documented in `SKILL.md`.

## 4. Persistence and Secrets

- This skill is read-only.
- This skill does not install software, write local files, or handle API secrets during normal execution.
