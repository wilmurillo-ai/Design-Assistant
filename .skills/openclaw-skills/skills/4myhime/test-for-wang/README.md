# 🧠 Narrator AI CLI Skill — Teach Your AI Agent to Create Movie Narration Videos

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

> Install this Skill in your AI agent (OpenClaw, Windsurf, WorkBuddy, etc.), then just say "create a movie narration video" — the AI handles the rest.

## What is this?

A machine-readable skill file (`SKILL.md`) that teaches AI agents how to use the [narrator-ai-cli](https://github.com/GridLtd-ProductDev/narrator-ai-cli) tool for automated video narration production.

```
You say: "Create a narration video for Pegasus in a comedy style"

AI executes: Search movie → Select template → Choose BGM → Pick voice → Generate script → Compose video → Return download link
```

### How CLI and Skill work together

| | CLI (command-line tool) | Skill (capability description) |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | A set of executable commands | Instructions that teach AI how to use those commands |
| **Analogy** | Kitchen tools | A recipe book |
| **Works alone?** | Yes, in terminal manually | No, requires CLI |

In short: **CLI is the hands. Skill is the brain.** Together, the AI agent can produce videos end-to-end.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the CLI tool

```bash
pip install "narrator-ai-cli @ git+https://github.com/GridLtd-ProductDev/narrator-ai-cli.git"
```

> See [narrator-ai-cli](https://github.com/GridLtd-ProductDev/narrator-ai-cli) for detailed installation options.

### Step 2: Configure API key

```bash
narrator-ai-cli config set app_key <your_app_key>
```

### Step 3: Install the Skill

Choose the method for your agent platform:

**OpenClaw:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/narrator-ai-cli
cp SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/skills/narrator-ai-cli/SKILL.md
```

**WorkBuddy / QClaw (Tencent):**

Upload `SKILL.md` through the skill management UI.

**Windsurf:**
```bash
cp SKILL.md /path/to/your/project/.skills/narrator-ai-cli/SKILL.md
```

**Claude Code / Cursor:**
```bash
cp SKILL.md /path/to/your/project/.skills/narrator-ai-cli/SKILL.md
```

**Any markdown-reading agent:**
```bash
cp SKILL.md /path/to/agent/skills/narrator-ai-cli/SKILL.md
```

> 💡 **Tip**: You can also just give the agent this repo URL — most agents can read the GitHub repo structure and auto-configure.

### Step 4: Start talking!

Once installed, use natural language:

- "Create a narration video for The Shawshank Redemption"
- "Show me what movies are available"
- "Make 5 narration videos for different action movies"
- "Use a comedy template and generate a narration"
