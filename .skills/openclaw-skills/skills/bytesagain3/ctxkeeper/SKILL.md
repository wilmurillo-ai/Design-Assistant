## When to Use

- Tracking context changes, runs, and checks over time with timestamped logs
- Keeping a structured journal of operational activities across categories
- Searching historical entries to find when something was run, checked, or analyzed
- Exporting logged data for review or sharing with teammates
- Monitoring overall activity via stats and recent commands

## Examples

```bash
# Record a run entry
ctxkeeper run "deployed api v2.3 to staging"

# Search all logs for a keyword
ctxkeeper search "staging"

ctxkeeper stats

# Check recent activity across all categories
ctxkeeper recent

# Record an analyze entry then review it
ctxkeeper analyze "memory usage spike at 14:00"
ctxkeeper analyze
```
