## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in `~/.local/share/rivalwatch/`:

- **`history.log`** — Master activity log with timestamps for every operation
- **`run.log`**, **`check.log`**, **`analyze.log`**, etc. — Per-command log files storing `timestamp|input` entries
- **`export.json`**, **`export.csv`**, **`export.txt`** — Generated export files

Each entry is stored in pipe-delimited format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|value`. The data directory is created automatically on first use.

## Requirements

- **Bash** 4.0+ (uses `set -euo pipefail`, `local` variables)
- **Standard Unix tools**: `date`, `wc`, `du`, `tail`, `grep`, `sed`, `basename`, `cat`
- No external dependencies, API keys, or network access required
- Works on Linux, macOS, and WSL

## When to Use

1. **Tracking competitor product changes** — Use `run` and `check` to log competitor updates, feature launches, or pricing changes over time
2. **Comparing market positioning** — Use `compare` to track how two or more competitors position themselves on features, pricing, or messaging
3. **Generating SWOT-style analysis** — Use `analyze` followed by `report` to build structured competitive intelligence documents
4. **Batch monitoring multiple competitors** — Use `batch` to queue and process data on several competitors in a single pass
5. **Exporting competitive data for presentations** — Use `export json` or `export csv` to produce structured data for dashboards or stakeholder reports

## Examples

```bash
# Log a competitor product update
rivalwatch run "Competitor X launched feature Y at $29/mo"

# Check competitor pricing
rivalwatch check "Competitor Z pricing page updated"

# Analyze market positioning
rivalwatch analyze "SaaS CRM market Q1 2025"

# Compare two competitors
rivalwatch compare "Slack vs Teams - enterprise features"

# Batch process multiple competitor entries
rivalwatch batch "CompA launch" "CompB pivot" "CompC funding"

# Export all competitive intel as JSON
rivalwatch export json

# Search for past entries mentioning a competitor
rivalwatch search "Competitor X"

# View summary statistics
rivalwatch stats
```

## Output

All commands output structured text to stdout. Use standard shell redirection to capture output:

```bash
rivalwatch stats > summary.txt
rivalwatch export json  # writes to ~/.local/share/rivalwatch/export.json
```
