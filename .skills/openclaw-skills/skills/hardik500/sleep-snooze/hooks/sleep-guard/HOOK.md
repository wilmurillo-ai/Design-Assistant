# Sleep Guard Hook

Fires on every `agent:bootstrap` event. Reads the current sleep state from `state.json` and — if sleep mode is active — injects a `SLEEP_MODE_ACTIVE.md` bootstrap file into the agent's context.

This ensures every agent, regardless of when its session started, is aware of sleep mode before taking any action.
