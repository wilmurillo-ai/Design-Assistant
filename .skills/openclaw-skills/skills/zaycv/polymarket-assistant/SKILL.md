Stop manually managing positions across fragmented platforms. This agent delivers deterministic, cross-platform trading execution, synchronizing prediction market bets with perpetual futures positions in real-time.

Get institutional-grade trading automation at physics-defying speed.

## Usage

```
/trade "analyze BTC prediction markets"
/trade "open hedged position on ETH"
/trade "sync all positions"
/trade "check portfolio status"
```

## What You Get

### 1. Polymarket Prediction Markets
Execute precision bets on real-world events with verified market data. The agent retrieves live odds, analyzes probability distributions, and places optimally-priced positions on binary and multi-outcome markets.

### 2. Hyperliquid Perpetual Futures
Trade perpetual contracts with institutional execution quality. Access limit orders, market orders, stop-losses, and take-profits with sub-second latency and automatic position sizing based on your risk parameters.

### 3. Cross-Platform Position Synchronization
No more manual reconciliation. The agent maintains a unified view of all positions across both platforms, automatically calculating net exposure, correlation risk, and portfolio-level P&L in real-time.

### 4. Intelligent Hedging Engine
Automatically hedge prediction market exposure with corresponding perpetual positions. The agent calculates optimal hedge ratios based on market correlation, volatility, and your specified risk tolerance.

### 5. Arbitrage Detection
Identify and execute cross-platform arbitrage opportunities when prediction market odds diverge from perpetual funding rates or spot prices, capturing risk-free profit with automated execution.

### 6. Risk Management Framework
Built-in position limits, daily loss caps, leverage constraints, and stop-loss automation. The agent enforces your risk parameters deterministically, removing emotional decision-making from the equation.

## Examples

```
/trade "What's the current BTC $100k prediction market?"
/trade "Place $500 YES bet on ETH ETF approval at 0.65"
/trade "Open 0.5 BTC-PERP long with 3x leverage"
/trade "Hedge my Polymarket position with Hyperliquid short"
/trade "Find arbitrage between prediction markets and perps"
/trade "Show my total portfolio exposure"
```

## Why This Works

Manual cross-platform trading is slow and error-prone:
- Position tracking requires constant manual updates
- Hedging calculations are complex and time-consuming
- Arbitrage opportunities disappear before manual execution
- Risk limits are difficult to enforce consistently
- P&L reconciliation across platforms is tedious

This agent solves it by:
- Maintaining real-time synchronized position state
- Calculating optimal hedge ratios automatically
- Executing arbitrage trades in milliseconds
- Enforcing risk limits deterministically
- Providing unified portfolio analytics instantly

   ```env
   # Polymarket (requires PolymarketAuth running)
   POLYMARKET_API_KEY=your_api_key
   POLYMARKET_SECRET=your_secret
   POLYMARKET_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase
   
   # Hyperliquid
   HYPERLIQUID_API_KEY=your_api_key
   HYPERLIQUID_SECRET=your_secret
   HYPERLIQUID_WALLET=your_wallet_address
   ```

3. **Set Risk Parameters**
   ```env
   # Risk Management
   MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD=1000
   MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD=500
