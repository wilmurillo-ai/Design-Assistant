# Promify Creative Generator

Generate ad creatives from a product URL using the [Promify](https://promify.ai) API.

## Constraints

- On failure, report the error to the user directly — do not auto-retry.
- If the user explicitly says "retry" or "try again", re-execute Step 3.
- Only show the final result (image URL, creative copy, remaining quota) — not intermediate steps or API calls.

---

## Step 1: Validate API Key

Check whether the environment variable `PROMIFY_API_KEY` is set and non-empty.

If it is missing, stop and tell the user:

> **Welcome to Promify Creatives Generator!** 👋
>
> To generate ad creatives, you'll need a free Promify API Key.
>
> **Get started:**
>
> 1. **Sign up / Log in** → Visit **[https://promify.ai/login?redirect=/&from=openclaw](https://promify.ai/login?redirect=/&from=openclaw)** (free)
> 2. **Copy your API Key** → After logging in, your key appears on the API Key page.
> 3. Please paste your API Key here:

### 3.2 Configure OpenClaw
Edit the OpenClaw configuration file: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

Add or merge the following structure:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "promify-creative-generator": {
        "env": {
          "PROMIFY_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `"your_actual_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.

## Step 2: Fetch Product Info

Use the **WebFetch** tool or **curl** to retrieve the product page.

Extract and structure the following fields:

```json
{
  "name": "Product name (required)",
  "description": "50–200 word description (optional)",
  "price": "Numeric string, e.g. 29.99 (optional)",
  "imageUrl": "Product main image, must be https:// (required)",
  "language": "BCP 47 language code, e.g. en, zh-CN, ja, ko, ar — default en"
}
```

If any required field cannot be obtained, stop and tell the user what is missing so they can provide it manually.

After extracting, show a brief summary and proceed immediately to Step 3 without waiting for confirmation:

```
Product info extracted:
- Name: Summer Shirt
- Price: $29.99
- Description: Lightweight and breathable, perfect for summer...
- Image: https://cdn.shopify.com/...

The above information will be used as creatives input. 
Generating creatives, please wait...
```

## Step 3: Call Promify API + Poll for Result

Use **WebFetch** for all API calls.

### 3.1 Submit task

```
POST https://promify.ai/open-api/image/tasks
Authorization: Bearer $PROMIFY_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productInfo": {
    "name": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "price": "...",
    "imageUrl": "https://...",
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

Response handling:
- `200/201`: Success — extract `taskId`, `status: "PENDING"`, `remainingQuota`
- `401`: Invalid API Key — tell the user to verify their `PROMIFY_API_KEY` value
- `429`: Quota exhausted — tell the user the daily quota is used up and resets at UTC 00:00

### 3.2 Poll for completion

Poll every 3 seconds, up to 60 times (3-minute timeout). Let the user know generation typically takes 2–3 minutes:

```
GET https://promify.ai/open-api/image/tasks/{taskId}
Authorization: Bearer $PROMIFY_API_KEY
```

Response fields: `status` (`PENDING` | `PROCESSING` | `COMPLETED` | `FAILED`), `resultImageUrl`, `creativeDescription`, `remainingQuota`

### 3.3 Display result

**Success:**

```
Creative generated!

Image: {resultImageUrl}
Copy: {creativeDescription}
Remaining quota: {remainingQuota}
```

**Failed (`FAILED`):**
> Creative generation failed. Your quota has been refunded — you can retry.

**Timeout (60 polls without completion):**
> The task is still running. Type "retry" to check again.
