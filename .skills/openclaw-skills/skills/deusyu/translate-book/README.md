# Rainman Translate Book

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Claude Code skill that translates entire books (PDF/DOCX/EPUB) into any language using parallel subagents.

> Inspired by [claude_translater](https://github.com/wizlijun/claude_translater), which translates books via shell scripts calling the Claude CLI. This project takes a different approach — it's built as a Claude Code Skill that orchestrates parallel subagents for translation, with manifest-based validation, resumable runs, and multi-format output. The architecture is fundamentally different, so this is an independent project rather than a fork.

## How It Works

```
Input (PDF/DOCX/EPUB)
  │
  ▼
Calibre ebook-convert → HTMLZ → HTML → Markdown
  │
  ▼
Split into chunks (chunk0001.md, chunk0002.md, ...)
  │  manifest.json tracks chunk hashes
  ▼
Parallel subagents (8 concurrent by default)
  │  each subagent: read 1 chunk → translate → write output_chunk*.md
  │  batched to respect API rate limits
  ▼
Validate (manifest hash check, 1:1 source↔output match)
  │
  ▼
Merge → Pandoc → HTML (with TOC) → Calibre → DOCX / EPUB / PDF
```

Each chunk gets its own independent subagent with a fresh context window. This prevents context accumulation and output truncation that happen when translating a full book in a single session.

## Features

- **Parallel subagents** — 8 concurrent translators per batch, each with isolated context
- **Resumable** — chunk-level resume; already-translated chunks are skipped on re-run (for metadata/template changes, use a fresh run)
- **Manifest validation** — SHA-256 hash tracking prevents stale or corrupt outputs from being merged
- **Multi-format output** — HTML (with floating TOC), DOCX, EPUB, PDF
- **Multi-language** — zh, en, ja, ko, fr, de, es (extensible)
- **PDF/DOCX/EPUB input** — Calibre handles the conversion heavy lifting

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** — installed and authenticated
- **Calibre** — `ebook-convert` command must be available ([download](https://calibre-ebook.com/))
- **Pandoc** — for HTML↔Markdown conversion ([download](https://pandoc.org/))
- **Python 3** with:
  - `pypandoc` — required (`pip install pypandoc`)
  - `beautifulsoup4` — optional, for better TOC generation (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the skill

**Option A: npx (recommended)**

```bash
npx skills add deusyu/translate-book -a claude-code -g
```

**Option B: ClawHub**

```bash
clawhub install rainman-translate-book
```

**Option C: Git clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deusyu/translate-book.git ~/.claude/skills/translate-book
```


### 2. Translate a book

In Claude Code, say:

```
translate /path/to/book.pdf to Chinese
```

Or use the slash command:

```
/translate-book translate /path/to/book.pdf to Japanese
```

The skill handles the full pipeline automatically — convert, chunk, translate in parallel, validate, merge, and build all output formats.

### 3. Find your outputs

All files are in `{book_name}_temp/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `output.md` | Merged translated Markdown |
| `book.html` | Web version with floating TOC |
| `book.docx` | Word document |
| `book.epub` | E-book |
| `book.pdf` | Print-ready PDF |

## Pipeline Details

### Step 1: Convert

```bash
python3 scripts/convert.py /path/to/book.pdf --olang zh
```

Calibre converts the input to HTMLZ, which is extracted and converted to Markdown, then split into chunks (~6000 chars each). A `manifest.json` records the SHA-256 hash of each source chunk for later validation.

### Step 2: Translate (parallel subagents)

The skill launches subagents in batches (default: 8 concurrent). Each subagent:

1. Reads one source chunk (e.g. `chunk0042.md`)
2. Translates to the target language
3. Writes the result to `output_chunk0042.md`

If a run is interrupted, re-running skips chunks that already have valid output files. Failed chunks are retried once automatically.

### Step 3: Merge & Build

```bash
python3 scripts/merge_and_build.py --temp-dir book_temp --title "《translated title》"
```

Before merging, the script validates:
- Every source chunk has a corresponding output file (1:1 match)
- Source chunk hashes match the manifest (no stale outputs)
- No output files are empty

Then: merge → Pandoc HTML → inject TOC → Calibre generates DOCX, EPUB, PDF.

**Note:** `{book_name}_temp/` is a working directory for a single translation run. If you change the title, author, output language, template, or image assets, either use a fresh temp directory or delete the existing final artifacts (`output.md`, `book*.html`, `book.docx`, `book.epub`, `book.pdf`) before re-running.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Claude Code skill definition — orchestrates the full pipeline |
| `scripts/convert.py` | PDF/DOCX/EPUB → Markdown chunks via Calibre HTMLZ |
| `scripts/manifest.py` | Chunk manifest: SHA-256 tracking and merge validation |
| `scripts/merge_and_build.py` | Merge chunks → HTML → DOCX/EPUB/PDF |
| `scripts/calibre_html_publish.py` | Calibre wrapper for format conversion |
| `scripts/template.html` | Web HTML template with floating TOC |
| `scripts/template_ebook.html` | Ebook HTML template |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `Calibre ebook-convert not found` | Install Calibre and ensure `ebook-convert` is in PATH |
| `Manifest validation failed` | Source chunks changed since splitting — re-run `convert.py` |
| `Missing source chunk` | Source file deleted — re-run `convert.py` to regenerate |
| Incomplete translation | Re-run the skill — it resumes from where it stopped |
| Changed title/template/assets but output didn't update | Delete existing `output.md`, `book*.html`, `book.docx`, `book.epub`, `book.pdf` from the temp dir, then re-run `merge_and_build.py` |
| `output.md exists but manifest invalid` | Stale output — the script auto-deletes and re-merges |
| PDF generation fails | Ensure Calibre is installed with PDF output support |
