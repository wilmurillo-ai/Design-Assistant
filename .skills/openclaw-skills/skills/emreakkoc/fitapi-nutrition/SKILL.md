# FitAPI — The Most Detailed Food & Exercise Database API

Ask your AI agent about any food, nutrient, exercise, or barcode — and get precise, science-grade data instead of LLM guesses.

**"How much omega-3 is in salmon?"** — FitAPI returns the exact value from curated scientific databases, not an approximation from training data.

## Setup — API key required

Before making any API calls, you need an API key. If the user hasn't configured one yet, guide them through setup:

1. **Sign up** at **https://fitapi.fitnessrec.com** — free account, no credit card needed
2. **Get the API key** from the dashboard at **https://fitapi.fitnessrec.com/dashboard**
3. **Configure this skill** with the API key

All requests are authenticated via the `Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}` header. If you get a `401` error, the key is missing or invalid — tell the user to check their key in the dashboard.

| Plan | Requests/day | Price |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Free | 10 | $0 forever |
| Paid | 500 | $9.99/year |
| Enterprise | 40,000 | $49.99/month |

All plans include every endpoint and all 47 languages.

## How to use this API — pick the right tool

You have 9 tools. **Do NOT just use `search_foods` for everything.** Each tool serves a specific purpose:

| User intent | Tool to use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "What's in chicken breast?" / "Calories in rice" | `search_foods` | Name-based lookup, returns full 180 nutrients per 100g + portions |
| "Foods highest in iron" / "High protein low carb" | `filter_foods` | Sort/rank by actual nutrient values — search can't do this |
| "Scan this barcode" / exact UPC/EAN number | `lookup_barcode` | Direct barcode → product lookup |
| "Find me a protein bar" / branded product name | `search_barcode` | Search 3M+ branded products by name |
| "How to do a deadlift?" / exercise lookup | `search_exercises` | Returns instructions, tips, muscle targeting, equipment |
| "Recipe for pad thai" / dish lookup | `search_dishes` | 80k+ recipes with ingredients matched to nutrition DB |
| "How much protein do I need?" / daily targets | `nutrition_needs` | Personalized macro/micronutrient targets from body stats |

### Recommended workflows (chain these for better answers)

**1. Meal planning — "Plan a high-protein lunch under 500 calories"**
1. `nutrition_needs` — get the user's daily targets (if body stats are known)
2. `filter_foods` — find foods matching criteria: `filter='1003 > 25 AND 1008 < 200', sort='1003:desc'`
3. Present options with portions and macros

**2. Recipe nutrition breakdown — "How many calories in caesar salad?"**
1. `search_dishes` — find the recipe, get `normalized_ingredients` with matched food IDs and gram amounts
2. Each ingredient includes `matched_id` — use `get_food` to retrieve full nutrient detail for any ingredient you need to examine
3. The dish itself already includes aggregated `nutrients` per 100g

**3. Diet comparison — "Which has more omega-3, salmon or mackerel?"**
1. `search_foods` for each food (returns full 180 nutrients including omega-3 as nutrient ID `4444`)
2. Compare the `nutrients.4444.value` fields directly

**4. Nutrient gap analysis — "Am I getting enough iron?"**
1. `nutrition_needs` — get daily iron requirement (nutrient `1089`)
2. `search_foods` for the user's logged foods — sum up iron from each
3. Compare total vs. requirement

**5. Barcode scanning — "What is this product?"**
1. `lookup_barcode` with the UPC/EAN number for direct match
2. If no match, fall back to `search_barcode` with the product name

**6. Exercise programming — "Chest exercises with dumbbells"**
1. `search_exercises` with `body_parts: ["chest"], equipments: ["Dumbbell"]`
2. Results include muscle activation percentages (`MuscleDistribution`) — use these to build balanced routines that cover all muscle groups

### Important: search_foods already returns complete data

`search_foods` returns **all 180 nutrients**, portions, and metadata per food. You do NOT need to call `get_food` after search — the data is identical. Use `get_food` only when you already have a food ID (e.g., from a recipe's `normalized_ingredients`).

### What you get

- **16,000+ foods** with 180 nutrients each — every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, fatty acid — curated from 5 international databases (USDA, NUTTAB, CNF2015, MEXT, FRIDA)
- **3 million+ branded products** — scan or search any barcode (UPC/EAN) for nutrition facts
- **80,000+ local recipes** from 48 languages — with ingredients matched to the nutrition database for accurate macros
- **5,000+ exercises** — step-by-step instructions, tips, main/granular/synergist muscles, equipment, and muscle activation percentages
- **Smart filtering** — "foods highest in iron", "high protein low fat seafood", "most omega-3" — sorted by actual nutrient values, not keyword matching
- **Personalized daily needs** — calculate exact macro/micronutrient targets based on body stats and goals
- **48 languages** — food names, exercise instructions, and recipe data translated natively

### Why not just ask the LLM?

LLMs estimate. FitAPI knows. When you ask "how much protein in chicken breast", an LLM guesses ~31g from training data. FitAPI returns 22.5g per 100g from the USDA database — the actual measured value. For serious nutrition tracking, the difference matters.
