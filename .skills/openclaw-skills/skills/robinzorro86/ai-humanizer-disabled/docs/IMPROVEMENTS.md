# Humanizer improvements and roadmap

This file tracks what shipped and what we plan to build next.

## Shipped in v2.3

### Detection hardening (pattern 29)

- Added **Invisible unicode obfuscation** detection (zero-width chars, soft hyphens, dense NBSP usage).
- Added safe auto-fix support to strip/normalize these characters.

Why: more detector-evasion tools now inject hidden unicode to appear "human" while remaining machine-generated.

## Shipped in v2.2

### New detection patterns (25-28)

- Reasoning chain artifacts
- Excessive structure
- Confidence calibration
- Acknowledgment loops

These additions improved detection on recent 2025-2026 model output where responses sound polished but still contain predictable assistant patterns.

### New CLI workflows

- `scan`: analyze a file or directory and rank documents by score
- `compare`: compare two drafts and show score + pattern deltas

These workflows make humanizer usable in docs QA and CI gates, not just one-off checks.

### Test coverage

- Added workflow tests (`tests/workflows.test.js`)
- Test suite now includes scan and compare behavior

## Why these updates mattered

The older feature set worked well for obvious chatbot text. The new patterns close gaps in subtler assistant writing, especially:

- question restatement loops
- over-structured responses to simple prompts
- confidence framing that sounds unnatural

## Current known limitations

- Docs that intentionally contain AI-style examples will score high (expected)
- The analyzer does not yet skip fenced code blocks by default
- Very short text can still be noisy

## Next candidate improvements (v2.3)

### 1) Optional code-block ignore mode

Add a scan/analyze option to skip fenced code blocks and inline snippets.

Why: technical docs often quote "bad" examples on purpose.

### 2) Baseline-aware doc gating

Store a baseline JSON report and fail only on regressions, not absolute score.

Why: avoids blocking teams when legacy docs are still being cleaned up.

### 3) Better non-English handling

Reduce false positives on multilingual docs and mixed-language text.

Why: current vocabulary-heavy checks are English-first.

## Validation checklist for each new pattern

- At least 5 positive tests
- At least 5 negative tests
- Edge cases for short/technical text
- Performance check to avoid slowing batch scans

## Notes for contributors

If you add a new pattern, include:

- clear rationale
- examples that should trigger
- examples that should not trigger
- a practical rewrite suggestion
