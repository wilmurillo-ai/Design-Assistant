# Lensmor Exhibitor Search — OpenClaw Skill

> Search for ICP-matching exhibitors at any trade show before the event starts.

**Best for**: B2B sales and marketing teams running pre-show prospecting, competitive mapping, or partner discovery.

## What It Does

Provide your company URL or a description of your target audience. The agent calls the Lensmor API and returns a structured list of exhibitors that match your ICP, with fields for industry, headcount, tech stack, funding stage, and LinkedIn — ready for outreach prioritization.

## Usage

```
Find exhibitors at Dreamforce 2026 that match our ICP — we sell to procurement teams at mid-market manufacturers.
```

```
Who is exhibiting at Hannover Messe 2026 that looks like our prospects? Our site is https://acme.com
```

```
Search for potential partners at CES 2026 using our company profile: https://acme.com
```

```
Which companies at SaaStr Annual 2026 could be ICP matches for us? We target mid-market finance ops teams.
```
