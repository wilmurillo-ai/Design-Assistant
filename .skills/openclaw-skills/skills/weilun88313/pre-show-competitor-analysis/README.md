# Pre-Show Competitor Analysis — OpenClaw Skill

> Map who you will face at the show and how to sharpen your positioning before you get there.

**Best for**: teams that already have a target event and need better messaging, threat scoring, and on-site watch points.

## What This Skill Does

Give the agent a show, competitor set, and your market context. It outputs:

- A structured competitor landscape before the event starts
- Threat scoring across booth presence, direct overlap, and messaging clash
- Clear separation between `[OBS]`, `[INF]`, `[HEARD]`, and `[EST]`
- White-space and differentiation opportunities
- Next-step handoffs into booth messaging, on-site observation, and follow-up

**Pre-Show · Competitive Intelligence**

## When to Use

**4-8 weeks before the show**, once exhibitor lists, floor plans, or show segments are available.

Use it when you need to answer questions like:
- Which competitors matter most at this event?
- What are they likely to emphasize?
- Where is there still open positioning space for us?

Do not use it for real-time field notes on the show floor. That is what `trade-show-competitor-radar` is for.

## Quick Examples

```
Who's exhibiting in surgical robotics at MEDICA 2026, and how should we position against them?
```

```
What do we know about Acme Corp's presence at PACK EXPO? We sell packaging workflow software and want to know if they're a real threat this year.
```

```
Analyze the competitive landscape at Hannover Messe for mid-market industrial automation software. Where is the messaging white space?
```

## Example Output

See [examples/medica-surgical-robotics-landscape.md](examples/medica-surgical-robotics-landscape.md) for a full worked example.

## Install

```bash
# Workspace-local
cp -r /path/to/trade-show-skills/pre-show-competitor-analysis <your-workspace>/skills/

# Shared (all workspaces)
cp -r /path/to/trade-show-skills/pre-show-competitor-analysis ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

## How It Works

The skill guides the agent through:

1. **Target show data collection** — exhibitor lists, floor plans, hall themes, public listings
2. **Signal extraction** — booth prominence, positioning language, launch signals, speaking presence
3. **Threat scoring** — standardized 3-15 score across overlap, prominence, and messaging clash
4. **Strategic response** — messaging, booth planning, watch list, and on-site verification priorities
