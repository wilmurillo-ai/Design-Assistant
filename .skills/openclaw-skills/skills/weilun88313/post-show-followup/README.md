# Post-Show Follow-up — OpenClaw Skill

> Turn booth conversations into 48-hour follow-up sequences matched to real lead quality.

**Best for**: teams leaving a show with hot, warm, and cold leads that need different next steps fast.

## What It Does

Tell the agent which show just ended and what you were selling. It generates:

- 3-tier lead classification system (hot / warm / cold) based on conversation quality
- Multi-email sequences for each tier, with different angles per email
- Personalization fields and CRM merge tag support (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Recommended send timing and practical tips for maximizing reply rates

80% of trade show leads never get followed up. This skill ensures yours do — with targeted sequences, not generic "great meeting you" blasts.

## Usage

```
MEDICA just ended. Help me write follow-up emails for the leads we collected.
```

```
We got 200 badge scans at Interpack. About 30 had real conversations, 10 asked for pricing. Write follow-up sequences for each group.
```

```
Write a post-show thank you email for people who visited our demo at CES.
```

```
I just got back from Hannover Messe with a spreadsheet of contacts. Help me prioritize and write follow-ups.
```
