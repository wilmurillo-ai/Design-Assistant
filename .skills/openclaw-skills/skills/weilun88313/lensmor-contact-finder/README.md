# Lensmor Contact Finder — OpenClaw Skill

> Find decision-makers and key contacts at target exhibitor companies for pre-show LinkedIn outreach.

**Best for**: B2B sales and marketing teams running account-based outreach before a trade show.

## What It Does

Provide a company name and optional role filter. The agent calls the Lensmor contacts API and returns a prioritized table of decision-makers and influencers with their titles, departments, seniority levels, and LinkedIn profile links.

Note: the API does not return email addresses. LinkedIn is the primary outreach channel.

## Usage

```
Who are the decision-makers at OperaOps I should reach out to before Dreamforce?
```

```
Find the procurement contacts at Spendly, VendorVault, and OperaOps.
```

```
Who runs marketing at Acme Corp? I want to schedule a meeting before Hannover Messe.
```

```
Find C-suite contacts at the top 5 companies from my exhibitor shortlist.
```

## Outreach Priority

Contacts are ranked by seniority and buyer function alignment:

| Seniority | Role in Outreach |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Executive | Decision-maker — concise, high-value pitch |
| Director | Budget holder or influencer — primary target |
| Manager | Champion or evaluator — discovery conversations |
| Individual Contributor | Referral path to above |
