# Smart Money Tracker

Track smart money (whale, VC fund, market maker) wallet activities on Ethereum mainnet. Get real-time trading signals when watched wallets make significant moves.

**v1.2.1**: After adding a custom address, agent **must** guide user to create a Cron monitoring task — without it, signals land in the database but the user receives no notification.

**v1.2**: Custom address subscriptions — add up to 5 personal wallets for real-time on-chain monitoring. Same address added by multiple agents shares one subscription stream (Reference Counting), no duplicate billing.

**v1.1**: Pool liquidity tracking — detect when whales add/remove liquidity on Uniswap V2/V3.

## MCP Endpoint

```
https://mcp-skills.ai.antalpha.com/mcp
```

Protocol: MCP Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC over HTTP with `mcp-session-id` header).

### Connection Flow

```
1. POST /mcp → initialize (get mcp-session-id from response header)
2. POST /mcp → tools/call  (with mcp-session-id header)
```

## Setup — Agent Registration

Before using any smart-money tools, register once:

```
Tool:  antalpha-register
Args:  {}
Returns: { agent_id, api_key, created_at }
```

**Persist both `agent_id` and `api_key` locally:**
- Store at `~/.smart-money/agent.json`
- `agent_id` — pass in all subsequent tool calls
- `api_key` — when server-side API key auth is enabled, send as HTTP header `x-antalpha-agent-api-key` on every MCP request

Example `agent.json`:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "api_key": "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "created_at": "2026-03-28T09:00:00.000Z"
}
```

On first use:
1. Check if `~/.smart-money/agent.json` exists
2. If not, call `antalpha-register`, save both `agent_id` and `api_key`
3. Use `agent_id` for all MCP calls; include `api_key` as header if auth is enabled

## MCP Tools (7)

### antalpha-register
Register a new agent. Returns unique `agent_id` and `api_key`. Call once, persist both.

### smart-money-signal
Get trading signals from monitored wallets (public pool + your custom addresses).

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` (required): Your agent ID
- `level` (optional): `high` / `medium` / `low` / `all` (default: `all`)
- `limit` (optional): 1-100 (default: 20)
- `since` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp

**Signal Levels (Transfer/Swap):**
- 🔴 **HIGH**: Large buy >$50K or first-time token position
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Accumulation (≥2 buys of same token in 24h) or large sell >$50K
- 🟢 **LOW**: Regular transfers $1K-$50K

**Signal Types:** `BUY` / `SELL` / `TRANSFER` / `POOL_IN` / `POOL_OUT`

### smart-money-watch
View a specific wallet's recent trading activity.

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` (required): Your agent ID
- `address` (required): Ethereum address (must be in public pool or your custom list)
- `limit` (optional): 1-50 (default: 10)

### smart-money-list
List all monitored wallets (public + custom, labeled).

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` (required): Your agent ID

### smart-money-custom
Manage custom watchlist — add, remove, or list personal monitoring addresses (max 5 per agent). v1.2: each add auto-registers an on-chain data subscription; same address shared across agents reuses one subscription stream (RC).

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` (required): Your agent ID
- `action` (required): `add` / `remove` / `list`
- `address` (optional): Ethereum address (required for add/remove)
- `label` (optional): Human-readable name (required for add)

**Behavior:**
- `add`: validates limit (≤5), creates/reuses subscription stream (RC), back-fills `stream_id`
- `remove`: decrements RC; cancels subscription only when last reference is released
- `list`: returns all custom addresses with `stream_id` and status

### smart-money-scan
Trigger on-demand scan of your custom addresses. Public pool is scanned automatically by the server.

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` (required): Your agent ID

### smart-money-pool
Query LP (liquidity pool) activity for smart money addresses. Returns add/remove liquidity events on Uniswap V2/V3.

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` (required): Your agent ID
- `address` (required): Whale wallet address (`0x...`)
- `event_type` (optional): `POOL_IN` / `POOL_OUT` / `all` (default: `all`)
- `dex` (optional): `uniswap_v2` / `uniswap_v3` / `all` (default: `all`)
- `limit` (optional): 1-50 (default: 10)
- `since` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp

**Signal Levels (Pool events):**
- 🔴 **HIGH**: POOL_IN > $100K
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: POOL_IN $10K–$100K
- 🟢 **LOW**: POOL_IN < $10K

## Workflow

### Query Signals (most common)

```
1. smart-money-signal { agent_id, level: "high", limit: 10 }
2. Present signals to user with level/token/amount/context
```

### Add Custom Wallet & Monitor (v1.2.1)

```
1. smart-money-custom { agent_id, action: "add", address: "0x...", label: "My Whale" }
   → On-chain subscription registered; stream_id back-filled
2. smart-money-scan { agent_id }       ← trigger first scan
3. smart-money-signal { agent_id }     ← check current results
4. ⚠️  MANDATORY: Guide user to create Cron (see Agent Behavior Rules below)
   → Without Cron, signals are stored server-side but user will NEVER be notified
```

### List / Remove Custom Address

```
# List all custom addresses
smart-money-custom { agent_id, action: "list" }

# Remove and auto-cancel on-chain subscription
smart-money-custom { agent_id, action: "remove", address: "0x..." }
```

### Periodic Monitoring (v1.2.1 — Mandatory Cron Setup)

> ⚠️ **Critical**: The on-chain data provider pushes events to the MCP Server in real time, but MCP cannot push to the agent. Without a Cron task, signals are stored server-side and the user will **never receive any notification**. Always create a Cron task after adding a custom address — do not leave it optional.

When the user asks to "monitor", "track", "watch", "set alert", "定时监控", "设置提醒", or after any `smart-money-custom action=add`:

**Step 1 — Set up the watchlist:**
```
1. smart-money-custom { action: "add", address: "0x...", label: "..." }
2. smart-money-scan { agent_id }
3. Confirm to user: "Address added, on-chain subscription registered."
```

**Step 2 — MANDATORY: Guide user to create Cron immediately**

Use this exact language (adapt to locale):
```
⚠️ 重要提示 / Important:

服务商已开始实时监控该地址，但 MCP 协议无法主动推送通知。
链上信号会实时落库，但不创建定时检查任务你将永远收不到提醒。
强烈建议立即创建定时任务，我来帮你自动完成。

The data provider is now tracking this address in real time, but MCP
cannot push notifications to you. On-chain signals will be stored, but
you will NEVER be alerted without a scheduled check task.
Let me create the Cron task for you now.

强烈建议：立即创建 15 分钟定时任务（我帮你自动执行）：
Strongly recommended: create a 15-min Cron task now (auto-executed for you):
```

**Step 3 — Create Cron immediately (agent executes without waiting for extra confirmation):**

Recommended interval: *15 minutes* (balances responsiveness vs. token cost).
```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "smart-money-alert" \
  --cron "*/15 * * * *" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Call smart-money-signal with agent_id <id>, level high, since <last_check_iso>. If new signals exist, notify me with details. If no new signals, reply HEARTBEAT_OK silently. Save current timestamp as last_check."
```

Key Cron design principles:
- `--session isolated` — runs independently, no context bleed
- Reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` when no new signals (zero output tokens)
- Pass `since` = last check timestamp to avoid duplicate alerts
- 15-min interval ≈ ~96 checks/day per user; each check ~500 tokens if silent
- Agent should execute this automatically after `add` succeeds — do not wait for user to ask

**Step 4 — Save monitor state:**

`~/.smart-money/monitor-state.json`:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "monitoring": true,
  "interval_minutes": 15,
  "min_level": "high",
  "last_check": "2026-04-17T08:00:00Z",
  "addresses_monitored": 1,
  "cron_name": "smart-money-alert"
}
```

## Agent Behavior Rules

### On "Monitor this address" / "添加监控" / "订阅地址" (v1.2.1)
1. Call `smart-money-custom { action: "add", ... }` — on-chain subscription auto-registered
2. Run `smart-money-scan` immediately for baseline
3. **⚠️ MANDATORY**: Show the strong nudge (see Periodic Monitoring → Step 2), then **immediately proceed to create the Cron task** — do not make it optional, do not wait for user to ask
4. Execute `openclaw cron add` with 15-min interval and `--session isolated`
5. Confirm: address added, stream_id, Cron job name and schedule
6. Only if user explicitly says "no cron" / "cancel" / "不要" — acknowledge and skip, but warn one more time that alerts will not work

### On "Remove monitoring" / "取消监控"
1. Call `smart-money-custom { action: "remove", address: "0x..." }` — on-chain subscription auto-cancelled
2. Update or cancel the associated Cron job
3. Confirm: "Monitoring stopped. On-chain subscription cancelled."

### On "List my custom addresses" / "查看我的自定义监控"
1. Call `smart-money-custom { action: "list" }`
2. Show: address, label, stream_id (active/inactive), added_at
3. Show remaining slots: `5 - current_count`

### On session start (if monitoring is enabled)
1. Read `~/.smart-money/monitor-state.json`
2. If `monitoring: true` and `now - last_check > interval`:
   - Run scan + signal check silently
   - Only speak up if new signals found
   - Update `last_check`
