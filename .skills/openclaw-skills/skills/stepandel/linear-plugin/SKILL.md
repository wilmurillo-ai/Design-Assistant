# Linear

You have Linear tools for managing issues and responding to notifications. These tools call the Linear GraphQL API directly — they handle auth, formatting, and error handling for you.

## Tools

### `linear_queue` — notification inbox

Manages the queue of Linear notifications routed to you by webhooks.

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `peek` | View all pending items sorted by priority. Non-destructive. |
| `pop` | Claim the highest-priority pending item (marks it `in_progress`). |
| `drain` | Claim all pending items (marks them `in_progress`). |
| `complete` | Finish work on a claimed item (requires `issueId`). Removes it from the queue. |

Queue items have this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "TEAM-123",
  "issueId": "TEAM-123",
  "event": "ticket",
  "summary": "Issue title or comment text",
  "priority": 1,
  "status": "pending",
  "addedAt": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

Event types:

| Event | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ticket` | You have a ticket to work on. |
| `mention` | You were mentioned in a comment. |

For `ticket` events, `id` and `issueId` are the same (the issue identifier). For `mention` events, `id` is the comment ID and `issueId` is the parent issue identifier. Always use `issueId` when calling `linear_issue`, `linear_comment`, or `linear_queue complete`.

Priority maps from the Linear issue (1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low, 5=None). Mentions always get priority 0, so they are processed before any ticket. Higher-priority items are popped first.

### `linear_issue` — manage issues

Manage Linear issues: view details, search/filter, create, update, and delete.

| Action | Required Params | Optional Params |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `issueId` | — |
| `list` | — | `state`, `assignee`, `team`, `project`, `limit` |
| `create` | `title` | `description`, `assignee`, `state`, `priority`, `team`, `project`, `parent`, `labels`, `dueDate` |
| `update` | `issueId` | `title`, `description`, `appendDescription`, `assignee`, `state`, `priority`, `labels`, `project`, `dueDate` |
| `delete` | `issueId` | — |

- `issueId` accepts human-readable identifiers like `ENG-123`
- `assignee` accepts display name or email
- `state` accepts workflow state name (e.g. `In Progress`, `Done`)
- `team` accepts team key (e.g. `ENG`)
- `priority` is numeric: 0=None, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low
- `labels` is an array of label names
- `parent` accepts a parent issue identifier for creating sub-issues
- `appendDescription` (boolean) — when true, appends `description` to the existing description instead of replacing it (update only)
- `dueDate` accepts a date string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g. `2025-12-31`); pass an empty string to clear the due date
- `description` supports markdown. **Use actual newlines for line breaks, not `\n` escape sequences** — literal `\n` will appear as-is in the ticket instead of creating line breaks

### `linear_comment` — manage comments

Read, create, and update comments on Linear issues.

| Action | Required Params | Optional Params |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | `issueId` | — |
| `add` | `issueId`, `body` | `parentCommentId` |
| `update` | `commentId`, `body` | — |

- `body` supports markdown. **Use actual newlines for line breaks, not `\n` escape sequences** — literal `\n` will appear as-is in the comment instead of creating line breaks
- `parentCommentId` threads the comment as a reply

### `linear_team` — teams and members

View teams and their members.

| Action | Required Params | Optional Params |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | — | — |
| `members` | `team` | — |

- `team` is the team key (e.g. `ENG`)

### `linear_project` — manage projects

List, view, and create Linear projects.

| Action | Required Params | Optional Params |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | — | `team`, `status` |
| `view` | `projectId` | — |
| `create` | `name` | `team`, `description` |

### `linear_relation` — issue relations

Manage relations between Linear issues (blocks, blocked-by, related, duplicate).

| Action | Required Params | Optional Params |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | `issueId` | — |
| `add` | `issueId`, `type`, `relatedIssueId` | — |
| `delete` | `relationId` | — |

- `type` is one of: `blocks`, `blocked-by`, `related`, `duplicate`

## Processing workflow

When you receive a Linear notification:

1. **Peek** with `linear_queue { action: "peek" }` to see all pending items.
2. **Skip** if there are no items.
3. **Pop** the next item with `linear_queue { action: "pop" }`. This claims it (status becomes `in_progress`).
4. **Read** the issue with `linear_issue { action: "view", issueId: "<id>" }`.
5. **Read comments** with `linear_comment { action: "list", issueId: "<id>" }` if the event is a mention or you need discussion context.
6. **Act** on the item:
   - `ticket` — do the work, then update state with `linear_issue { action: "update", ... }`.
   - `mention` — read the thread and reply with `linear_comment { action: "add", ... }`.
7. **Complete** with `linear_queue { action: "complete", issueId: "<id>" }` to remove it from the queue.
8. **Repeat** from step 3 until pop returns null.
