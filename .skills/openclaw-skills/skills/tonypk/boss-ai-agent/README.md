# Boss AI Agent

Your AI management advisor — works instantly after install, no account needed.

## Features

- **Web Dashboard**: real-time analytics at [manageaibrain.com](https://manageaibrain.com) — 20+ pages including Dashboard, Company State, KPI Metrics, Projects, Tasks, Incentives, Recommendations, Goals, Reviews, Skills, Training, Career Paths

## Install

```
clawhub install boss-ai-agent
```

## Quick Start

### Advisor Mode (no setup needed)

```
/boss-ai-agent
→ Running in Advisor Mode.
→ Which mentor? Musk / Inamori / Ma ...
→ You: "How should I handle a consistently late employee?"
→ [Musk-flavored management advice with action steps]
```

### Team Operations Mode (connect MCP first)

**Option A: CLI (stdio) — Recommended**

Add to your MCP config (Claude Code `settings.json`, Hermes Agent config, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "management-brain": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tonykk/management-brain-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MANAGEMENT_BRAIN_API_KEY": "mb_your_api_key_here",
        "MANAGEMENT_BRAIN_BASE_URL": "https://manageaibrain.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: HTTP**

Connect to `https://manageaibrain.com/mcp` with `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_HTTP_API_KEY>`. For ChatGPT, Gemini, and web-based clients.

Then:

```
/boss-ai-agent
→ Running in Team Operations Mode — connected to your team.
→ How many people do you manage? 5
→ What communication tools? Telegram and GitHub
→ Done! Musk mode activated. First check-in at 9 AM tomorrow.
```

## How It Works

The skill auto-detects which mode to use based on whether MCP tools are available.

**Advisor Mode**: AI uses embedded mentor frameworks (decision matrices, culture packs, scenario templates) to answer management questions directly. No network communication — everything runs from the skill instructions.

**Team Operations Mode**: AI connects to the MCP server for real team operations. Two transport options:
- **CLI (stdio)**: `npx -y @tonykk/management-brain-mcp` — only needs `MANAGEMENT_BRAIN_API_KEY`. Recommended for Claude Code, Hermes Agent, and stdio-capable clients.
- **HTTP**: Connect to `manageaibrain.com/mcp` — needs `MCP_HTTP_API_KEY` Bearer auth. For ChatGPT, Gemini, and web-based clients.

Tool parameters (employee names, discussion topics, message content) are sent to the cloud server for processing. Write tools deliver messages to employees via connected platforms. Local files (`config.json`, chat history, memory) stay on your machine and are not transmitted to the server.

**Persistent behavior** (Team Operations only): Registers up to 6 cron jobs that run autonomously — including jobs that send messages to employees. Solo founder mode (team=0) only registers 3 (briefing, signalScan, sync). Review schedules in `config.json` before activating. Manage with `cron list` / `cron remove`.

## OpenClaw Integration Architecture

Boss AI Agent is the **brain layer** — it connects to its own backend (`manageaibrain.com/mcp`) for team data processing, while third-party tool integrations are handled by OpenClaw's MCP connectors.

```
OpenClaw Runtime (user environment)
  ├── MCP Connectors (user self-installs)
  │    ├── Storage: Notion / Google Sheets  ←── bidirectional sync targets
  │    ├── Development: GitHub / Linear / Calendar
  │    └── Communication: Telegram / Slack / Discord / Lark
  │
  └── Boss AI Agent Skill (brain layer + sync orchestrator)
       └── manageaibrain.com API
            ├── 33 MCP tools (daily ops + intelligence + sync)
            ├── Company Context Layer  ← foundation
            ├── Execution Intelligence ← signals + risks
            ├── Communication Parser   ← messages → events
            ├── Incentive Engine       ← context-aware scoring
            ├── AI Recommendations     ← proactive suggestions
            └── Sync Service           ← Notion/Sheets bidirectional sync
```

**Company Context Layer** is the foundation — all intelligence engines depend on it:
- Storage connectors (Notion/Jira/Sheets) → project updates, task status, documentation flow into context
- Dev connectors (GitHub/Linear) → PR activity, commit patterns, CI status feed into execution signals
- Communication connectors (Telegram/Slack/Discord/Lark) → employee messages are parsed into structured management events

**Key principle**: the skill does NOT manage tokens for third-party tools (Notion, GitHub, etc.) — OpenClaw handles those connections. The skill connects to its own `manageaibrain.com/mcp` backend (authenticated via `MANAGEMENT_BRAIN_API_KEY`) and consumes third-party connector data to build management intelligence.
