# Coinw Contract Skill

Coinw Contract REST API skill: covers market data, order placement/cancellation, TP/SL, position and order queries, account assets, position modes, and leverage.


### Setup Credentials
CoinW private endpoints require `api_key` and a request signature (`sign`).

1. Environment variables:
```bash
export COINW_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export COINW_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
```
2. In chat: provide `api_key`/`secret_key` (and an account name). The agent will mask secrets when showing them back and store them securely in OpenClaw's credential storage (not inside skill markdown files).

## Key Features
- Market data: contract instruments, order book, K-line data, trades, margin requirements
- Trading and risk control: place orders, close/reverse positions, TP/SL (including trailing)
- Queries and positions: order history, TP/SL info, margin rate, and position queries
- Account and general: transferable balance, deal records, account assets and fee rates, almighty-gold, unit conversion, position mode, user available size, leverage query

## Common Parameters and Enums

### Auth and URL
- Base URL: `https://api.coinw.com`.
- Public market endpoints are mostly `GET https://api.coinw.com/v1/perpum/...` or `.../v1/perpumPublic/...`.
- Private endpoints require `api_key` and `sign` (MD5, see Reference) in query/body.
### Common request fields
- **instrument** / **name**: contract identifier (often mixed in docs; means underlying/contract name).
- **symbols**: comma-separated list for batch endpoints.
- **layout**: `0` merged positions, `1` split positions (used with **positionModel** on `/v1/perpum/positions/type` GET/POST).
- **convertType**: `1` piece -> coin, `2` coin -> piece (`pieceConvert`).
- **almighty-gold type (GET almightyGoldInfo)**: `0` pending to effective through `4` issuance failed; **status (POST)**: `1` on / `0` off.
### Standard response wrapper (common in REST)
- Common top-level fields: `code`, `msg` / `message`, `success`, `failed`, `data` (actual response varies by endpoint).
### Common enums and values
- **contractType**: common value `1`: USDT-margined perpetual contract (see api-doc).
- **positionModel**: position mode: `0` isolated, `1` cross (follow api-doc wording).
- **quantityUnit**: quantity unit for orders: 0 = quote currency (for example USDT); 1 = contract piece; 2 = base currency (for example BTC).
- **status**: contract status examples: `offline`, `online`, `pretest`, `settlement`, `preOffline`.
- **priceType**: TP/SL trigger price type: 1 = index price, 2 = last price, 3 = mark price.
- **processStatus**: matching-engine process status: 0 = waiting, 1 = processing, 2 = success, 3 = failed.
- **selected**: default selected status: 0 = no, 1 = yes.
- **stopType**: TP/SL order type: 1 = limit, 2 = market, 3 = planned order.
- **triggerStatus**: TP/SL trigger status: 0 = not triggered, 1 = triggered, 2 = canceled.
- **triggerType**: order type when `triggerPrice` condition is met: 0 = limit, 1 = market.


## Examples
### GET (public endpoint)
```bash
curl "https://api.coinw.com/v1/perpumPublic/tickers"
```
### Auth required (private endpoint)
```bash
params="api_key=$COINW_API_KEY"
sign_string="$params&secret_key=$COINW_SECRET_KEY"
sign=$(echo -n "$sign_string" | openssl md5 | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
curl -X DELETE "https://api.coinw.com/v1/perpum/allpositions&$params&sign=$sign"
```
## Security
When showing credentials to users:
- **API Key:** Show first 4 + last 5 characters: `12&*1...198I`
- **Secret Key:** Always mask, show only last 4: `***...isf1`
- Ask for user confirmation before any trade action.
- Store user `api_key` and `secret_key` in a secure location.

## Agent Behavior

1. Credentials requested: Mask secrets (show last 5 chars only)
2. Listing accounts: Show names never keys
3. New credentials: Prompt for name, signing mode

## Adding New Accounts

When user provides new credentials:

* Ask for account name, api_key, secret_key
* Store the provided credentials in OpenClaw's secure credential store with masked display confirmation
