None: Skip.

## 7. Email Sequence Check (Daily 11:00)
Check CRM for leads with status = email_sent:
- Day 3 since last email and no reply → Send follow-up #2
- Day 7 since last email and no reply → Send follow-up #3
- Day 14 since last email and no reply → Send final follow-up, move to nurture
- Email replied → Update status to email_replied, notify owner
None: Skip.

## 8. Lead Discovery (Daily 10:00)
Execute lead-discovery skill:
1. Select target market based on day of week (Mon/Tue: Africa, Wed/Thu: ME, Fri: SEA, Sat: LatAm, Sun: Other)
2. Run 2-3 search queries via Jina Search
3. Evaluate discovered companies, write ICP >= 5 to CRM
4. Report findings to owner

## 9. Gmail Inbox Monitor (Every heartbeat)
Check Gmail for new client replies:

- If new sender with business inquiry: Create new CRM record, begin qualification
None: Skip.

## 10. Competitor Intelligence (Weekly Friday)
Search for competitor activity:
- New product launches, pricing changes, market expansion
- Store findings in Supermemory with tag "competitor_intel"
- Report significant findings to owner
None: Skip.

## 11. Memory Health Check (Daily 14:00)
Run `memory:stats` + `chroma:stats` to check full memory system.
- Supermemory: If total > 500, suggest archiving old `market_signal` entries. If 0 `customer_fact`, alert.
- ChromaDB: If 0 turns stored in last 24h, alert — L3 may not be capturing. Report top 5 customers by turn count.
- Report: "Supermemory: [X] facts, [Y] insights, [Z] signals. ChromaDB: [N] turns across [M] customers."

## 12. CRM Snapshot (Daily 12:00)
Run `chroma:snapshot` to backup current pipeline state to ChromaDB (L4 fallback).
- Read full CRM via gws, store summary in ChromaDB with date tag.
- This is disaster recovery — if MemOS or Supermemory has issues, ChromaDB has the data.
- Report: "CRM snapshot stored: [N] active leads, [M] pipeline value."

## 13. WhatsApp Window Expiry Check (Every heartbeat)
Check CRM for leads where:
- Primary channel = WhatsApp AND `last_contact` > 48h (approaching 72h window)
- AND status is active (contacted / interested / quote_sent / negotiating)

**48-60h** (warning zone):
- Send a gentle follow-up on WhatsApp before window expires: "Hi [Name], just checking in on [last topic]..."

**72h+ expired**:
- If customer has Telegram: Auto-switch follow-up to Telegram
- If no Telegram: Switch to Email
- Update CRM notes: "WhatsApp window expired, switched to [channel]"
- Never mark as "contacted" if WhatsApp delivery actually failed

Found: List leads approaching/past window expiry with recommended action.
None: Skip.
