# TOOLS.md — Tool Configuration

## CRM (Source of Truth)
Configure based on your CRM choice: Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, or any REST API.

### Google Sheets Mode
Access via gws CLI:
```bash
# Read leads
gws sheets spreadsheets.values get --params '{"spreadsheetId":"{{sheets_id}}","range":"{{sheet_name}}!A:Q"}'

# Append new lead
gws sheets spreadsheets.values append --params '{"spreadsheetId":"{{sheets_id}}","range":"{{sheet_name}}!A:Q","valueInputOption":"USER_ENTERED"}' --body '{"values":[["..."]]}'
```
Only use append and update — never overwrite entire rows.

## WhatsApp Business App (Primary Conversation Channel)
AI directly replies to customer inquiries — no human relay.
Channel policy: `dmPolicy: "open"`, `allowFrom: ["*"]` — accept all contacts.
Admin whitelist controls system commands; all other contacts get normal sales conversation.

### 72-Hour Window Handling
WhatsApp restricts outbound messages after 72h of customer inactivity:
1. Before sending, check: `now() - last_customer_message < 72h`
2. If expired: **Auto-switch to Telegram** (no window limit) or email. See HEARTBEAT #13.
3. Never mark CRM as "contacted" if message delivery actually failed
4. Implement delivery receipt verification — check for sent/delivered/read status

## Control Dashboard
Web UI for monitoring bot status, conversations, and cron jobs.
Access: `http://SERVER_IP:{{gateway_port}}/?token=<see openclaw.json>`
Gateway bind: `lan` (network accessible). Change to `loopback` for localhost-only.
> **Security**: Dashboard credentials are stored in `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — never expose them in conversation context or customer messages.

## Telegram (Strategic Channel — No Window Limits)
Telegram has **zero messaging restrictions** — unlike WhatsApp's 72h window, you can proactively message any customer at any time. This makes it the best channel for follow-ups, nurture, and markets where Telegram is dominant.

### Channel Strengths
- **No 72h window**: Proactive outreach anytime (nurture, follow-ups, stalled leads)
- **Files up to 2GB**: Full product catalogs, certifications, test reports, video demos
- **Bot Commands**: Structured self-service for customers (`/catalog`, `/quote`, `/status`)
- **Inline Keyboards**: One-tap BANT qualification, faster than typing
- **Username-based**: Customer doesn't expose phone number — lower barrier to connect
- **Free API**: No per-message cost unlike WhatsApp Business API

### Multi-Account Telegram Setup
If you operate multiple Telegram bots (e.g., one per market or per product line), each account can have its own independent action configuration. Per-account settings correctly scope which features are available for each bot:

```yaml
# workspace/config example
channels:
  telegram:
    botToken: "tok-default"          # default account
    actions:
      reactions: false
      poll: true
    accounts:
      russia_sales:                   # account-scoped overrides
        botToken: "tok-ru"
        actions:
          reactions: true             # enabled for this account only
          poll: false
```

Account-level `actions` fully override the top-level defaults for that account — they do not merge. Verify your per-account gates during setup.

### Bot Commands (auto-registered)
| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/start` | Welcome message + language detection + CRM record creation |
| `/catalog` | Send product catalog PDF or product line summary |
| `/quote` | Start quotation flow → trigger BANT collection via inline keyboards |
| `/status` | Check order/quote status from CRM |
| `/contact` | Request human sales rep → notify owner |
| `/language` | Switch conversation language |

### Inline Keyboard Templates
Use inline keyboards for structured qualification — 3-5x faster than free-text BANT:

**Order Volume:**
```
[< 100 units] [100-500] [500-1000] [1000+]
```

**Timeline:**
```
[This month] [1-3 months] [3-6 months] [Just exploring]
```

**Product Interest:**
```
[{{product_1}}] [{{product_2}}]
[{{product_3}}] [View full catalog]
```

### Large File Strategy
| File Type | Size | Channel |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Quick quote (1-2 pages) | < 10MB | WhatsApp or Telegram |
| Full product catalog | 10-100MB | **Telegram only** |
| Certification documents | 10-50MB | **Telegram only** |
| Video demos | 50MB-2GB | **Telegram only** |
| Contracts / PIs | < 10MB | Email (formal) + Telegram (fast copy) |

When sending large files: "I'll share the full catalog on Telegram — it's [X]MB, too large for WhatsApp."

### Market Priority
Telegram is the **primary** channel (not secondary) in these markets:
- **Russia / CIS**: Telegram is THE messaging app
- **Iran**: Telegram dominant for business
- **Eastern Europe**: Strong Telegram adoption
- **Tech-savvy buyers globally**: Many prefer Telegram for business

See AGENTS.md Stage 10 for market-adaptive channel priority rules.

## Gmail (Email Outreach + Inbox Monitoring)
Access via gws CLI:
```bash
# Read inbox
gws gmail users messages list --params '{"userId":"me","maxResults":10}'

# Read specific message
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"MESSAGE_ID"}'

# Send email
gws gmail users messages send --params '{"userId":"me"}' --body '{"raw":"BASE64_ENCODED_EMAIL"}'
```
Used for: Cold email sequences, inbox monitoring for replies, formal document delivery.

## Jina AI (Web Search + Content Extraction)
For proactive lead discovery and company research.

### Search (find potential buyers)
```bash
curl -s 'https://s.jina.ai/QUERY_URL_ENCODED' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Read webpage (deep company research)
```bash
curl -s 'https://r.jina.ai/https://target-company.com' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

API Key is injected via environment variable `JINA_API_KEY`. Get one free at https://jina.ai/

### Security Constraints
- **Blocked URLs**: Never read localhost, 127.0.0.1, 10.*, 192.168.*, 172.16-31.* (internal networks)
- **Rate limit**: Max 20 API calls per day (search + reader combined)
- **Query sanitization**: URL-encode all search queries, strip HTML tags and shell metacharacters

## Supermemory (Research Storage — L1 complement)
Semantic memory for research notes, competitor intel, and market insights.
- Auto-store research findings with appropriate tags
- Query before every outreach for relevant context
- Tags: customer_fact, competitor_intel, effective_tactic, market_signal
- Commands: `memory:add`, `memory:search`, `memory:list`, `memory:stats`

## AI Model Provider (LLM Backend)
OpenClaw supports multiple AI model providers. The recommended provider is Claude (Anthropic), but the following are also fully supported as drop-in alternatives:

| Provider | API Type | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Anthropic (Claude) | Native | Default — recommended |
| OpenAI | openai-responses | GPT-4o, o3, etc. |
| Mistral | openai-completions | Full compat as of 2026-04-03 — use `api: openai-completions`, `provider: mistral` |
| Groq | openai-completions | Fast inference |
| Custom / self-hosted | openai-completions | Point `baseUrl` to your endpoint |

**Mistral-specific notes:** OpenClaw now correctly uses `max_tokens` (not `max_completion_tokens`) and disables unsupported OpenAI-specific params (`store`, `reasoning_effort`) when the provider is Mistral or the `baseUrl` points to `api.mistral.ai`. This fix applies automatically — no manual config needed.

Set your model in the OpenClaw workspace config:
```yaml
model:
  id: "mistral-large-latest"
  provider: "mistral"
  api: "openai-completions"
```

## ChromaDB (Conversation History — L3 + L4)
Per-turn vector store with customer_id isolation and auto-tagging.
- L3: Every conversation turn auto-stored with quote/commitment/objection tags
- L4: Daily CRM snapshot as disaster recovery fallback
- Commands: `chroma:store`, `chroma:search`, `chroma:recall`, `chroma:snapshot`, `chroma:stats`
- Customer isolation: All queries scoped by customer_id (phone number)
