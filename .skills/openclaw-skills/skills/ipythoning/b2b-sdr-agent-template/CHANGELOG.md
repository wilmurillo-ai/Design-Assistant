## [Unreleased]

## 2026-04-05 — v3.4.0

### Added
- **Operator Bilingual Mode** — English for customers, Chinese self-chat sync for operators
  Non-English-speaking operators can now run a global English-facing SDR without needing
  to read English. The agent replies to customers in English and immediately sends a
  Chinese translation to itself via WhatsApp self-chat. Operators read Chinese in their
  "Message to myself" channel; customers only ever see English.

  How it works:
  - Customer sends any language → Agent always replies in English
  - After each English reply → Agent silently sends Chinese translation via self-chat
  - Owner reports (Pipeline daily, quote approvals, notifications) → always Chinese
  - No hardcoded numbers, no extra config — works with `selfChatMode: true` (default)

## 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Telegram: per-account action configuration now correctly applied during discovery**
  If you run multiple Telegram bots (e.g., one per market), each account's `actions` block
  (reactions, polls, inline buttons) is now independently honored. Previously, only the
  top-level channel config was evaluated regardless of `accountId`.
  Upstream: `fb8048a188e5` — "fix: honor telegram action discovery account config"

- **Mistral AI provider: full transport compatibility**
  OpenClaw now correctly handles Mistral's API quirks when using Mistral as the LLM backend:
  - Uses `max_tokens` instead of `max_completion_tokens`
  - Suppresses unsupported OpenAI-specific params (`store`, `reasoning_effort`)
  - Applies automatically for `provider: mistral` and any custom provider whose `baseUrl`
    points to `api.mistral.ai`
  Upstream: `6ac5806a3957` — "fix(providers): honor mistral transport compat (#60405)"

### Documentation
- Added Multi-Account Telegram Setup guide to `workspace/TOOLS.md`
- Added AI Model Provider reference table (Claude, OpenAI, Mistral, Groq) to `workspace/TOOLS.md`
