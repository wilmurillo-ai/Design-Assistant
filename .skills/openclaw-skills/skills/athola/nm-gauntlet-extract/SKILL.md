# Extract Codebase Knowledge

Build or rebuild the `.gauntlet/knowledge.json` knowledge base.

## Steps

1. **Identify target directory**: use the current working directory
   or a user-specified path

2. **Run AST extraction**: invoke the extractor script
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/extractor.py <target-dir>
   ```

3. **AI enrichment**: for each extracted entry, enhance the `detail`
   field with natural language explanation of business logic, data
   flow, architectural role, and rationale

4. **Cross-reference**: link related entries across modules by
   matching imports, shared types, and data flow paths

5. **Merge with annotations**: preserve existing curated entries
   in `.gauntlet/annotations/`

6. **Save**: write to `.gauntlet/knowledge.json`

7. **Report**: show summary by category, coverage gaps, difficulty
   distribution
