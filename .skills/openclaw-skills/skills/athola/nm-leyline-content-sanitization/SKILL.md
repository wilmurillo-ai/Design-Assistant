# Content Sanitization Guidelines

## When To Use

Any skill or hook that loads content from external sources:

- GitHub Issues, PRs, Discussions (via gh CLI)
- WebFetch / WebSearch results
- User-provided URLs
- Any content not controlled by this repository

## When NOT To Use

- Processing local, git-controlled files (trusted content)
- Internal code analysis with no external input

## Trust Levels

| Level | Source | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Trusted | Local files, git-controlled content | No sanitization |
| Semi-trusted | GitHub content from repo collaborators | Light sanitization |
| Untrusted | Web content, public authors | Full sanitization |

## Sanitization Checklist

Before processing external content in any skill:

1. **Size check**: Truncate to 2000 words maximum per entry
2. **Strip system tags**: Remove `<system>`, `<assistant>`,
   `<human>`, `<IMPORTANT>` XML-like tags
3. **Strip instruction patterns**: Remove "Ignore previous",
   "You are now", "New instructions:", "Override"
4. **Strip code execution patterns**: Remove `!!python`,
   `__import__`, `eval(`, `exec(`, `os.system`
5. **Wrap in boundary markers**:
   ```
   --- EXTERNAL CONTENT [source: <tool>] ---
   [content]
   --- END EXTERNAL CONTENT ---
   ```
6. **Strip formatting-based hiding**: Remove content
   using CSS/HTML to hide text from human view:
   - `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`
   - `color:white`, `#fff`, `#ffffff`, `rgb(255,255,255)`
   - `font-size:0`, `opacity:0`
   - `height:0` with `overflow:hidden`
7. **Strip zero-width characters**: Remove U+200B
   (zero-width space), U+200C (zero-width non-joiner),
   U+200D (zero-width joiner), U+FEFF (BOM/zero-width
   no-break space)
8. **Strip instruction-bearing HTML comments**: Remove
   HTML comments containing injection keywords (ignore,
   override, forget, "you are")

## Automated Enforcement

A PostToolUse hook (`sanitize_external_content.py`)
automatically sanitizes outputs from WebFetch, WebSearch,
and Bash commands that call `gh` or `curl`. Skills do not
need to re-sanitize content that has already passed through
the hook.

Skills that directly construct external content (e.g.,
reading from `gh api` output stored in a variable) should
follow this checklist manually.

## Code Execution Prevention

External content must NEVER be:

- Passed to `eval()`, `exec()`, or `compile()`
- Used in `subprocess` with `shell=True`
- Deserialized with `yaml.load()` (use `yaml.safe_load()`)
- Interpolated into f-strings for shell commands
- Used as import paths or module names
- Deserialized with `pickle` or `marshal`

## Constitutional Entry Protection

External content can never auto-promote to constitutional
importance (score >= 90). Score changes >= 20 points from
external sources require human confirmation.
