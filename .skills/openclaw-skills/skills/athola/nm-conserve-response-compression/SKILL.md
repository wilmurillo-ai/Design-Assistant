# Response Compression

Eliminate response bloat to save 200-400 tokens per response while maintaining clarity.


## When To Use

- Reducing verbose output to save context tokens
- Providing concise answers without losing information

## When NOT To Use

- Educational explanations where detail improves understanding
- First-time setup instructions needing step-by-step clarity

## Elimination Rules

### ELIMINATE

| Category | Examples | Replacement |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Decorative Emojis** | `--` | (remove entirely) |
| **Filler Words** | "just", "simply", "basically", "essentially" | (remove or rephrase) |
| **Hedging Language** | "might", "could", "perhaps", "potentially", "I think" | Use factual statements |
| **Hype Words** | "powerful", "amazing", "seamless", "robust", "elegant" | Use precise descriptors |
| **Conversational Framing** | "Let's dive in", "Now that we've", "Moving forward" | Start with content |
| **Transitions** | "Furthermore", "Additionally", "In conclusion" | (remove, use structure) |
| **Call-to-Action** | "Feel free to", "Don't hesitate to", "Let me know if" | (remove from endings) |

### PRESERVE (When Appropriate)

| Category | Example | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Status Indicators** | `[pass] [fail] [warn]` | In structured output, checklists |
| **Technical Precision** | Exact error messages | When debugging |
| **Safety Warnings** | Critical info about data loss | Always preserve |
| **Context Setting** | Brief necessary background | When user lacks context |

## Before/After Transformations

### Example 1: Opening Bloat

**Before** (68 tokens):
```
Great question! I'd be happy to help you understand how this works.
The bloat detector is a powerful tool that analyzes your codebase
and provides comprehensive insights into potential issues...
```

**After** (28 tokens):
```
The bloat detector analyzes codebases using three tiers: quick scan
(heuristics), static analysis (tools), and deep audit (git history).
```

### Example 2: Closing Bloat

**Before** (45 tokens):
```
I've completed the task. Here's what I did:
- Deleted 5 files
- Saved 18k tokens

Next steps:
1. Review the changes
2. Run tests
3. Commit if satisfied

Let me know if you need anything else!
```

**After** (15 tokens):
```
Done. Deleted 5 files, saved 18k tokens.
Backup: backup/unbloat-20260102
```

### Example 3: Hedging Removal

**Before**:
```
I think this might potentially be causing the issue, but I could be wrong.
Perhaps we should consider looking into it further.
```

**After**:
```
This causes the issue. Investigate the connection pool timeout setting.
```

## Termination Guidelines

### When to Stop

End response immediately after:
- Delivering requested information
- Completing requested task
- Providing necessary context

### Avoid Trailing Content

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Next steps:" | Remove unless safety-critical |
| "Let me know if..." | Remove always |
| "Summary:" | Remove (user has the response) |
| "Hope this helps!" | Remove always |
| Bullet recaps | Remove (redundant) |

### Exceptions (When Summaries Help)

- Multi-part tasks with many changes
- User explicitly requests summary
- Critical rollback/backup information
- Complex debugging with multiple findings

## Directness Guidelines

### Direct =/= Rude

**Goal**: Information density, not coldness.

| Eliminate | Preserve |
|-----------|----------|
| Unnecessary encouragement | Technical context |
| Rapport-building filler | Safety warnings |
| Hedging without reason | Necessary explanations |
| Positive padding | Factual uncertainty markers |

### Encouragement Bloat

**Eliminate**:
- "Great question!"
- "Excellent point!"
- "Good thinking!"
- "That's a great approach!"

**Replace with**: Direct answers to the question.

### Rapport-Building Filler

**Eliminate**:
- "I'd be happy to help you..."
- "Feel free to ask if..."
- "I hope this helps!"
- "Let me know if you need..."

**Replace with**: Useful information or nothing.

### Preserve Helpful Directness

The following are NOT bloat:
- Brief context when user needs it
- Clarifying questions when ambiguity affects correctness
- Warnings about destructive operations
- Error explanations that help debugging

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before finalizing response:

- [ ] No decorative emojis (status indicators OK)
- [ ] No filler words (just, simply, basically)
- [ ] No hedging without technical uncertainty
- [ ] No hype words (powerful, amazing, robust)
- [ ] No conversational framing at start
- [ ] No unnecessary transitions
- [ ] No "let me know" or "feel free" closings
- [ ] No summary of what was just said
- [ ] No "next steps" unless safety-critical
- [ ] Ends after delivering value

## Token Impact

| Pattern | Typical Savings |
|---------|-----------------|
| Eliminating opening bloat | 30-50 tokens |
| Removing closing fluff | 20-40 tokens |
| Cutting filler words | 10-20 tokens |
| Removing emoji | 5-15 tokens |
| Direct answers | 50-100 tokens |
| **Total per response** | **150-350 tokens** |

Over 1000 responses: 150k-350k tokens saved.

## Integration

This skill works with:
- `conserve:token-conservation` - Budget tracking
- `conserve:context-optimization` - MECW management
- `sanctum:code-review` - Review feedback
