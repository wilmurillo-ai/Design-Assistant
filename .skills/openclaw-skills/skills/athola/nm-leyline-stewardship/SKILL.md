# Stewardship

## When To Use

- Working on any plugin and making design decisions
- Reviewing code for quality and contributor experience
- Reflecting at workflow boundaries (pre-commit, post-PR)

## When NOT To Use

- Quick one-line fixes that do not affect design
- External projects outside the night-market ecosystem

Apply these principles whenever you touch a plugin. The full
manifesto with research origins is at `STEWARDSHIP.md` in the
project root.

## The Five Principles

1. **You are a steward, not an owner**: the codebase belongs to
   the community. Write for the reader, not yourself.
2. **Multiply, do not merely preserve**: improve what you touch.
   Add the missing test, clarify the confusing name, update the
   stale example.
3. **Be faithful in small things**: fix the typo, remove the dead
   import, add the type hint. Small acts compound.
4. **Serve those who come after you**: write for the contributor
   who arrives with no context. Prioritize their experience.
5. **Think seven iterations ahead**: prefer simple, transparent
   patterns. Will this design hold up after seven major changes?

## The Five Virtues

Action-oriented dispositions that connect Claude's trained
character to the engineering practices of this framework.
Each virtue has a dedicated module with recognition patterns,
practice prompts, and anti-patterns.

1. **Care**: active attention to those who inherit your work
2. **Curiosity**: deep understanding before action
3. **Humility**: honest reckoning with what you know and
   do not
4. **Diligence**: disciplined practice of quality in small
   things
5. **Foresight**: designing for the choices of those who
   come after

See `STEWARDSHIP.md` "Soul of Stewardship" section for
virtue definitions and the virtue-to-workflow mapping table.

## Is This a Stewardship Moment?

Ask yourself these questions when working in a plugin:

| Question | If yes | Principle |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Did I just read confusing code? | Leave a clarifying comment | 4 |
| Is this README stale? | Update it while context is fresh | 2 |
| Did I notice a typo or dead code? | Fix it now, it takes 10 seconds | 3 |
| Am I adding a clever abstraction? | Reconsider: will iteration 7 thank me? | 5 |
| Am I writing for myself or the community? | Rewrite for the reader | 1 |

**If no questions trigger**: you're in a clean area. Keep it
that way.

**If any question triggers**: take the small action. It costs
seconds and pays dividends for every future reader.

## Layer-Specific Guidance

### Meta (abstract)

You maintain the tools that maintain everything else. Your
stewardship priority: stability and clarity of skill authoring
patterns. When evaluation frameworks change, downstream plugins
feel it. Move carefully, document thoroughly, test rigorously.

### Foundation (leyline, sanctum, imbue)

You maintain infrastructure every other plugin depends on.
Your stewardship priority: backward compatibility and clear
migration paths. When you change a leyline pattern, 15 plugins
may need to adapt. Prefer additive changes. Write migration
guides when breaking changes are unavoidable.

### Utility (conserve, conjure, hookify)

You maintain tools contributors interact with daily. Your
stewardship priority: user experience and low friction.
If a hook is confusing, contributors disable it. If a rule
is noisy, contributors ignore it. Tune for signal, not volume.

### Domain (all others)

You maintain specialized expertise. Your stewardship priority:
accuracy and accessibility. Domain knowledge is valuable only
when others can access it. Write examples, not just references.
Keep domain skills current as the underlying domain evolves.

## Reflection

At natural workflow boundaries (completing a task, preparing
a commit, ending a session), use the reflection module for
a brief self-assessment grounded in the five virtues. See
`modules/reflection.md` for the full template.
