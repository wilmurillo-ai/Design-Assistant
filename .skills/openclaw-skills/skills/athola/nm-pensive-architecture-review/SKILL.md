# Architecture Review Workflow

Architecture assessment against ADRs and design principles.

## Quick Start

```bash
/architecture-review
```

## When To Use

- Approving reimplementations.
- Large-scale refactoring reviews.
- System design changes.
- New module/service introduction.
- Dependency restructuring.

## When NOT To Use

- Selecting architecture paradigms - use archetypes
  skills
- API surface review - use api-review
- Selecting architecture paradigms - use archetypes
  skills
- API surface review - use api-review

## Progressive Loading

Load modules based on review scope:

- **`modules/adr-audit.md`** (~400 tokens): ADR verification and documentation.
- **`modules/coupling-analysis.md`** (~450 tokens): Dependency analysis and boundary violations.
- **`modules/principle-checks.md`** (~500 tokens): Code quality, security, and performance.
- **`modules/fpf-methodology.md`** (~800 tokens): FPF (Functional, Practical, Foundation) multi-perspective review methodology.

Load all modules for full reviews. For focused reviews, load only relevant modules.

## Required TodoWrite Items

1. `arch-review:context-established`: Repository, branch, motivation.
2. `arch-review:adr-audit`: ADR verification and new ADR needs.
3. `arch-review:interaction-mapping`: Module coupling analysis.
4. `arch-review:principle-checks`: LoD, security, performance.
5. `arch-review:risks-actions`: Recommendation and follow-ups.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Context (`arch-review:context-established`)

Confirm repository and branch:
```bash
pwd
git status -sb
```

Document:
- Feature/bug/epic motivating review.
- Affected subsystems.
- Architectural intent from README/docs.
- Design trade-off assumptions.

### Step 2: ADR Audit (`arch-review:adr-audit`)

**Load: `modules/adr-audit.md`**

- Locate ADRs in project.
- Verify required sections.
- Check status flow.
- Confirm immutability compliance.
- Flag need for new ADRs.

### Step 3: Interaction Mapping (`arch-review:interaction-mapping`)

**Load: `modules/coupling-analysis.md`**

- Diagram before/after module interactions.
- Verify composition boundaries.
- Check data ownership clarity.
- Validate dependency flow direction.
- Identify coupling violations.

### Step 4: Principle Checks (`arch-review:principle-checks`)

**Load: `modules/principle-checks.md`**

- Law of Demeter.
- Anti-slop patterns.
- Security (input validation, least privilege).
- Performance (N+1 queries, caching).

### Step 5: Risks and Actions (`arch-review:risks-actions`)

Summarize using `imbue:diff-analysis/modules/risk-assessment-framework`:
- Current vs proposed architecture.
- Business impact.
- Technical debt implications.

List follow-ups with owners and dates.

Provide recommendation:
- **Approve**: Architecture sound.
- **Approve with actions**: Minor issues to address.
- **Block**: Fundamental problems requiring redesign.

## Architecture Principles Checklist

### Coupling
- [ ] Dependencies follow defined boundaries.
- [ ] No circular dependencies.
- [ ] Extension points used properly.
- [ ] Abstractions don't leak.

### Cohesion
- [ ] Related functionality grouped.
- [ ] Single responsibility per module.
- [ ] Clear module purposes.

### Layering
- [ ] Layers have clear responsibilities.
- [ ] Dependencies flow downward.
- [ ] No layer bypassing.

### Evolution
- [ ] Changes are reversible.
- [ ] Migration paths are clear.
- [ ] ADRs document decisions.
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found**
Ensure all dependencies are installed and in PATH

**Permission errors**
Check file permissions and run with appropriate privileges

**Unexpected behavior**
Enable verbose logging with `--verbose` flag
