### High-Frequency Shift Words

These common words had the largest frequency increase in post-ChatGPT text. Individually unremarkable; their co-occurrence is the signal.

**10-word co-occurrence test** (5+ in a single paragraph = strong signal):
```
across, additionally, comprehensive, crucial, enhancing,
exhibited, insights, notably, particularly, within
```

### New Verbs (Score: 3 each)
```
underscore(s), bolster, foster, harness, illuminate,

Note: "underscores the importance" is a near-diagnostic construction (13.8x human baseline frequency).

### New Adjectives (Score: 2-3 each)
```
seamless, invaluable, dynamic, whimsical, vibrant,
timeless, sustainable (outside environmental context)
```

### New Adverbs (Score: 2 each)
```
aptly, tirelessly, seamlessly, vividly
```

### New Nouns (Score: 2 each)
```
interplay, facet, symphony (metaphorical), endeavor,
synergy, insights (as padding: "provides valuable insights")
```

```
"It's important to note that"
"It's important to remember that"
"Generally speaking"
"To some extent"

```
"areas for improvement" (avoids saying "problems")
"invaluable resource"
"exceptional"
"remarkable"
```

AI text is measured at 50% more sycophantic than human text (Georgetown AI Sycophancy Research, 2025).

## False-Positive Exclusions

Always define what to detect AND what to ignore.
Flagging legitimate usage erodes trust in the detector.

### Word-Level Exclusions

| Word | Skip When | Flag When |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| delve | Technical deep-dive, data analysis | Generic "delve into the topic" |
| leverage | Physics, mechanics, finance (actual leverage) | Business jargon substitute for "use" |
| robust | Engineering specs, statistical methods | Marketing claims, feature descriptions |
| seamless | Measured UX testing results with data | Feature descriptions without evidence |
| journey | Actual travel, user journey maps with data | Metaphor for any process or experience |
| comprehensive | Describing verified 100% coverage | Filler adjective for any collection |
| nuanced | Academic analysis with cited evidence | Flattery or vague praise |
| foster | Childcare, horticulture, proper nouns | Generic "foster collaboration/innovation" |
| landscape | Geography, actual visual design | "the AI landscape", "competitive landscape" |
| ecosystem | Biology, verified platform with APIs | Vague reference to any group of things |
| insights | Data analysis with specific findings | "provides valuable insights" (padding) |
| dynamic | Physics, runtime behavior (code) | Filler adjective for any changing thing |

### Phrase-Level Exclusions

| Phrase | Skip When | Flag When |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| "at its core" | Describing actual CPU/kernel internals | Filler for "basically" |
| "it's worth noting" | Preceding a genuine caveat with evidence | Preceding obvious information |
| "generally speaking" | Qualifying a statistical claim | Hedging an opinion |
| "areas for improvement" | Formal performance review documents | Avoiding saying "problems" or "bugs" |

### Structural Exclusions

Do not flag these as slop even if they match patterns:

- **Quoted text**: Content inside blockquotes or citation marks
- **Code examples**: Technical terms inside backticks or code blocks
- **Proper nouns**: Product names, titles, organizations
- **Direct citations**: Attributed quotes from named sources
- **Glossary definitions**: Defining a term that happens to be a slop word
- **Changelogs**: Version history entries using standardized language
- **Generated output**: Content explicitly marked as AI-generated for comparison

## Scoring Formula

```python
def calculate_vocabulary_score(text, word_count):
    tier1_matches = count_tier1_matches(text)
    tier2_matches = count_tier2_matches(text)
    phrase_matches = count_phrase_matches(text)

    raw_score = (tier1_matches * 3) + (tier2_matches * 2) + (phrase_matches * 3)
    normalized = (raw_score / word_count) * 100

    return min(10.0, normalized)  # Cap at 10
```
