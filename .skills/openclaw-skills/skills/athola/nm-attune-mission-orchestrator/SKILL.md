# Mission Orchestrator

## Overview

Wraps the entire attune development lifecycle (brainstorm → specify → plan → execute) into a single mission with automatic state detection, type selection, and phase routing. Follows the "persistent presence lens" pattern from `spec-kit:speckit-orchestrator` — delegates entirely to existing skills via `Skill()` calls, never re-implements phase logic.

## When To Use

- Starting a new project from scratch (full lifecycle)
- Resuming an interrupted project workflow
- Running a focused tactical implementation from existing specs
- Quick-fixing from an existing implementation plan

## When NOT To Use

- Running a single phase directly (use `/attune:brainstorm`, `/attune:specify`, etc.)
- Non-project work (code review, debugging, research)
- When you need fine-grained control over phase transitions

## Mission Lifecycle

```
1. State Detection
   Scan for existing artifacts (project-brief.md, specification.md, etc.)
       |
2. Mission Type Selection
   Auto-detect type based on artifacts, or accept user override
       |
3. Phase Routing Loop
   For each phase in the mission type:
       a. Pre-phase validation (check prerequisites)
       b. Invoke Skill(attune:{phase-skill})
       c. Post-phase artifact check (verify output exists)
       d. Post-phase backlog triage (create GitHub issues
          for out-of-scope items after brainstorm/specify)
       e. Update mission state
       f. User checkpoint (skippable with --auto)
       g. Error handling via leyline:damage-control
       |
4. Completion
   All phases complete, final state saved
```

## Mission Types

| Type | Phases | Auto-detected When |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| `full` | brainstorm → specify → plan → execute | No artifacts exist |
| `standard` | specify → plan → execute | `docs/project-brief.md` exists |
| `tactical` | plan → execute | `docs/specification.md` exists |
| `quickfix` | execute | `docs/implementation-plan.md` exists |

See `modules/mission-types.md` for full type definitions and custom type support.

## Phase-to-Skill Mapping

| Phase | Skill Invoked | Artifact Produced |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| brainstorm | `Skill(attune:project-brainstorming)` | `docs/project-brief.md` |
| specify | `Skill(attune:project-specification)` | `docs/specification.md` |
| plan | `Skill(attune:project-planning)` | `docs/implementation-plan.md` |
| execute | `Skill(attune:project-execution)` | Implemented code + tests |

The orchestrator **never** re-implements phase logic. Each phase is a complete `Skill()` invocation that handles its own workflow.

## Session Recovery

Missions persist state to `.attune/mission-state.json`. On resume:

1. Load mission state file
2. Validate referenced artifacts still exist on disk
3. Identify last completed phase
4. Continue from next phase in sequence

See `modules/mission-state.md` for the state schema and recovery protocol.

## Mission Charter

Define mission boundaries using the structured template from
`references/mission-charter.md`. A Mission Charter specifies:

- **Outcome**: What success looks like
- **Success metric**: Measurable completion criteria
- **Deadline**: Time boundary (session, date, or duration)
- **Constraints**: Token/time budgets, forbidden actions
- **Scope**: In-scope and out-of-scope areas
- **Stop criteria**: Conditions that halt the mission

See `references/mission-charter.md` for the full template and
examples.

## Progress Reports

Track progress with structured checkpoints using
`references/progress-report.md`. Generate reports at:

- Phase boundaries (between brainstorm→specify→plan→execute)
- Blocker identification
- Risk escalation
- Budget thresholds (50%, 75%, 90%)

See `references/progress-report.md` for the template and
checkpoint rhythm guidance.
