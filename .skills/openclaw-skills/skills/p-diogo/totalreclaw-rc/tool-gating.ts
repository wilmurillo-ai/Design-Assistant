/**

 * tools are blocked when state is anything other than `active`. Billing +
 * setup-adjacent tools remain usable — users need to be able to upgrade,
 * migrate, and start onboarding before their vault is active.
 *
 * This module imports ONLY types + the state resolver. No I/O beyond what
 * `resolveOnboardingState` already does; no network; no env reads.
