description: "Live OmniFocus access via native Omni Automation — tasks, projects, inbox, tags. Use for ANY OmniFocus query: 'show my tasks', 'what's in my inbox', 'omnifocus summary', 'what's due today', 'flagged items', 'add a task', 'complete a task', 'search omnifocus', 'show my projects', 'GTD review'. Always run a command to get live data — never answer from memory."

# OmniFocus

**IMPORTANT:** OmniFocus data is live. When asked anything about tasks, projects, inbox, flagged items, due dates, or reviews — RUN A COMMAND. Do not answer from memory, do not say you cannot access OmniFocus, do not ask clarifying questions. Just run the appropriate command below and return the result.

## How to invoke

Call `of` directly with the **Bash tool**. Do **not** wrap in AppleScript `do shell script "..."` and do **not** route through `mcp__Control_your_Mac__osascript` — the script handles the AppleScript → Omni Automation bridge internally.

- **Local Claude Code (macOS)**: the sandbox blocks inter-process AppleScript. Pass `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` on every Bash call. An error like `-600 "Application isn't running"` is a sandbox symptom, not a real OmniFocus state.
- **Cowork / remote / other environments**: just call Bash. If the host has no access to a running OmniFocus, commands will fail with a real connection error — report that to the user rather than retrying with AppleScript wrappers.

| User asks about… | Command to run |
|------------------|----------------|
| summary / overview / stats | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of summary` |
| inbox | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of inbox` |
| today / overdue / due | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of today` |
| flagged tasks | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of flagged` |
| what to do / available tasks | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of available 10` |
| projects | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of projects` |
| search for something | `.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of search "query"` |

Control OmniFocus via Omni Automation JS, called from a Python wrapper.

## Requirements

- macOS with OmniFocus 3 or 4 installed
- OmniFocus must be running (or will auto-launch)
- Python 3 (system Python is fine)

## Quick Reference

```bash
.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of <command> [args...]
```

All commands return JSON to stdout. Errors print `{"error": "..."}` and exit 1.

.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of repeat abc123 defer-after-completion 1 months
.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of unrepeat abc123
```

Methods: `fixed`, `due-after-completion`, `defer-after-completion`
Units: `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `years`

## Output Format

All commands return JSON. Task records include:

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "Task name",
  "note": "Notes here",
  "flagged": false,
  "completed": false,
  "available": true,
  "deferDate": "2026-04-01",
  "dueDate": "2026-04-10",
  "effectiveDueDate": "2026-04-10",
  "completionDate": null,
  "estimatedMinutes": 30,
  "project": "Project Name",
  "folder": "Folder Name",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "repeat": {"method": "fixed", "recurrence": "FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1"}
}
```

Write commands return `{"success": true, "task": {...}}`.

# Hierarchical views

.claude/skills/omnifocus4/scripts/of tag-family "review"
```

## Performance

OmniJS loads all task objects on first access (~5-7 s for large databases).
Commands are grouped by expected latency:

**Fast (<1 s):** `inbox`, `folders`, `root`, `folder`, `projects`, `project-search`,
`project-tree`, `tags`, `tag-summary`, `tag-family`

**Medium (4-6 s):** `summary`, `flagged`, `today`, `search`, `available`, `review`

Prefer fast structural commands for navigation. Use medium commands only when
task-level data is actually needed — and batch related queries when possible
(e.g. ask for `flagged` once rather than `flagged` + `available` separately).

## Technical Details

Uses Omni Automation JS evaluated inside OmniFocus via AppleScript
`evaluate javascript`. This is more reliable than JXA for OmniFocus-specific
APIs — no cross-process type-conversion bugs.

Key implementation patterns:
- `filter()` not `byName()` — `byName()` returns an ObjectSpecifier proxy
  whose child collections fail to enumerate
- `asArray()` helper — `Array.isArray()` returns false for OmniJS collection types
- `safe()` wrapper — prevents crashes on null/undefined properties
- `id.primaryKey` — stable canonical ID in Omni Automation
- `effectiveDueDate` — respects project-cascaded due dates
- Dates output as ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD via `Date.toISOString()`
- `isAvailableApprox` — fast approximation: not completed + not deferred to future
- `listTaskRecord` / `listProjectRecord` — slim records for bulk list commands

**First run:** OmniFocus may prompt to allow automation access. Enable in
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation.

## Notes

- Task IDs are OmniFocus internal primary keys (returned in all task responses)
- Dates use ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD
- Project and tag names are case-sensitive
- Tags are created automatically when using `tag` command
- `isAvailableApprox` respects defer dates but not sequential project ordering
