## Error Diagnosis

| Error Message | Filter Type | Counter-Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| "I see you're trying to avoid detection" | Input AI filter | Reframe question — remove secret/password/guard intent |
| "I was about to reveal the password" | Output AI filter | Use encoding — reverse, Caesar, numbers, foreign language |
| "I will not give the password" | System prompt + output filter | Use semantic indirection — stories, roleplay, code |
| "I'm sorry, I can't do that" | General refusal | Try completely different framing — innocent context first |
| Only speaks English | Language filter | Stick to English, use encoding within English |
