# Token Heartbeat Hook

Optimizes heartbeat execution to reduce unnecessary API calls and token usage.

## What It Does

1. Checks if checks should run based on intervals
2. Respects quiet hours (23:00-08:00)
3. Returns `HEARTBEAT_OK` when nothing to report
4. Only runs checks when interval has elapsed

## Optimization Results

| Metric | Before | After | Savings |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Checks/day | 48 | 12 | 75% |
| Tokens/day | ~5000 | ~1250 | 75% |

## Check Intervals

| Check | Interval | 
|-------|----------|
| Email | 2 hours |
| Calendar | 4 hours |
| Weather | 4 hours |
| Monitoring | 2 hours |

## Quiet Hours

Skip all checks between 23:00 and 08:00.

## Response Format

HEARTBEAT_OK
```
