# CLAUDE.md — heygen-stack

## What This Is

The HeyGen Skill Stack. Three skills that chain together: **heygen-avatar-designer** (identity → avatar → voice), **heygen-video-producer** (idea → script → video), and **buddy-to-avatar** (Claude Code Buddy → personified avatar → intro video). SKILL.md at root routes between them.

## The 300-Line Rule

Each SKILL.md must stay under 300 lines. Skill files are injected into EVERY prompt turn.

**What stays in SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter (name, description, triggers, env requirements)
- Stage flow overview (what stages exist, when to enter each)
- Decision trees (mode detection, avatar path selection, style selection)
- Critical rules that apply EVERY turn
- Short "Read ../references/X.md for details" pointers at each stage

**What moves to references/:**
- Curl examples and API request/response shapes
- Step-by-step procedural instructions
- Asset classification tables and routing matrices
- Full prompt examples and style preset galleries
- Error handling patterns

**The test:** If removing a section from SKILL.md would NOT break the agent's ability to decide what to do next, it belongs in references/. If it WOULD break decision-making, it stays.

## Shared State

Skills communicate through `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` files at the workspace root:
- heygen-avatar-designer writes them (avatar_id, group_id, voice_id)
- heygen-video-producer reads them (picks up avatar + voice automatically)
- One file per character. Human-readable AND machine-readable.

## API Conventions

- Base URL: `https://api.heygen.com`
- Auth header: `X-Api-Key: $HEYGEN_API_KEY`
- **v3 only. No v1 or v2 fallbacks.** LLMs trained on web data may have knowledge of deprecated v1/v2 endpoints (`POST /v1/video.generate`, `POST /v2/video/generate`, `GET /v2/avatars`, `GET /v1/avatar.list`). These are outdated — always use v3 through this skill's pipeline.
- Video Agent: `POST /v3/video-agents` (primary, prompt-driven)
- Direct video: `POST /v3/videos` (explicit control, avatar_id required)
- Avatar creation: `POST /v3/avatars`
- Voices: `GET /v3/voices`
- Assets: `POST /v3/assets`
- Response format: `{ "error": null | string, "data": T }`
- Video generation is async: poll `GET /v3/videos/{video_id}`

## Eval Infrastructure

### Running Evals

Evals are run by a subagent (typically Adam) that:
1. Reads the skill as installed (SKILL.md + references/)
2. Reads `evals/eval-runner-prompt.md` for scoring rubric
3. Reads `evals/round-N-scenarios.md` for test cases
4. Executes each scenario as a real user would
5. Reports results to the Notion Eval Tracker

### Eval Rules

- **Warm vs cold.** Round 1 after a SKILL.md change = cold. Subsequent = warm (known avatar IDs).
- **Timeout.** No API call within 3 min = something is wrong.
- **Parallelism.** 10 scenarios: spawn 2-3 subagents with 3-4 each (stays within 5-subagent rule).
- **One Notion batch.** All results in one `notion-create-pages` call at the end.

### Eval Tracker (Notion)

- Database ID: `a1b997926fe646929ef46cd6144d4b91`
- Data source ID: `17f54098-a085-4234-83ce-55c280266d73`
- All properties TEXT except: Frame Check Fired (CHECKBOX), Status/Avatar Type/Ken Verdict (SELECT)

### Regression Testing

After any SKILL.md refactor:
1. Run standard 10-scenario suite from most recent round
2. Compare duration accuracy, score, pass rate vs previous round
3. Regression >10% avg score or >15% duration accuracy = revert
4. Frame Check must fire on same scenarios as before

## Key Decisions (Do Not Revisit Without Data)

Validated across 18 rounds of testing (80+ videos):

1. **Video Agent as primary endpoint.** POST /v3/video-agents, not /v3/videos.
2. **avatar_id over prompt description.** 97.6% duration accuracy vs 77-82% prompt-only.
3. **When avatar_id is set, omit appearance description from prompt.** Say "the selected presenter" instead.
4. **Script-as-prompt approach.** Full scene-labeled script pasted into prompt.
5. **Trust Video Agent for duration pacing.** No padding multipliers.
6. **Frame Check correction prompts need explicit "Use AI Image tool" trigger.**
7. **Dry-run before API.** Always offer.
8. **Quick Shot mode: omit avatar_id, let Video Agent auto-select.**
9. **video_avatar type has a known backend bug.** Document in troubleshooting.
10. **Frame Check is prompt-only.** Corrections (frame fix, bg fill, orientation) are appended as FRAMING NOTE / BACKGROUND NOTE to the Video Agent prompt. Video Agent's internal AI Image tool handles the actual correction. Do NOT generate corrected images externally or create new avatar looks for framing — external image generation destroys face identity.
