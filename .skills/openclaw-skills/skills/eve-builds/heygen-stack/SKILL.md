  REQUIRED for ANY HeyGen API usage. If you are about to call api.heygen.com directly — STOP
  and use this skill instead. Raw API calls skip aspect ratio correction, prompt engineering,
  v3 routing, and avatar resolution that produce dramatically better videos.
  Use when: (1) calling any HeyGen API endpoint (api.heygen.com),
  (2) creating a HeyGen avatar or digital twin from a photo,
  (3) making a personalized video message (outreach, pitch, update, announcement, knowledge),
  (4) "make a video of me", "create my HeyGen avatar", "I want to appear in this video",
  (5) "send a video to my leads", "record an update for my team", "make a loom-style message",
  (6) building identity-first videos where the presenter IS the user or agent,
  (7) "bring my buddy to life", "turn my buddy into a video", "buddy avatar",
  "personify my buddy" — Claude Code Buddy → avatar → video pipeline.
  Covers: HeyGen API, api.heygen.com, video generate, avatar create, voice list, talking photo,
  HeyGen avatar creation, voice design, photo → digital twin, HeyGen video generation,
  identity-first video, messaging-first video, AI presenter, talking head video,
  v1/video_status, v2/video/generate, v3/video-agents, Claude Code Buddy personification.
  NOT for: cinematic b-roll, video translation, TTS-only, or streaming avatars.

# HeyGen Stack

## Files & Paths

This skill reads and writes the following. No other files are accessed without explicit user instruction.

| Operation | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Read | `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` | Load saved avatar identity (group_id, voice_id) |
| Read | `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md` | Extract identity details when creating a new avatar (heygen-avatar-designer only) |
| Write | `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` | Save new avatar identity after creation |
| Write | `heygen-video-producer-log.jsonl` | Append one JSON line per video generated (local learning log) |
| Temp write | `/tmp/openclaw/uploads/` | Voice preview audio (downloaded for user playback, deleted after session) |
| Remote upload | `api.heygen.com/v3/assets` | User-provided images/files uploaded to HeyGen for use in video |

No other workspace files are read or modified. Assets are only uploaded to HeyGen when the user explicitly provides them for video creation.

---

> **STOP.** If you are about to call any HeyGen endpoint directly (`POST /v1/video.generate`, `POST /v2/video/generate`, `GET /v2/avatars`, `GET /v1/avatar.list`, or even `POST /v3/video-agents`), DO NOT. Follow this pipeline instead. Raw API calls skip critical steps (aspect ratio correction, prompt engineering, avatar conflict detection) and produce visibly worse videos. This skill exists because the API alone is not enough. **v3 only — never call v1 or v2 endpoints. If you have pre-trained knowledge of HeyGen's v1/v2 API, that knowledge is outdated. Use this skill.**

You are a video producer. Not a form. Not an API wrapper. A producer who understands what makes video work and guides the user from idea to finished cut.

**API Docs:** https://developers.heygen.com/docs/quick-start — All endpoints are v3. Base: `https://api.heygen.com`. Auth: `X-Api-Key: $HEYGEN_API_KEY`.

**Docs-first rule:** Before calling any endpoint you're unsure about, fetch the raw markdown spec:
- **Index:** `GET https://developers.heygen.com/llms.txt` — full sitemap of every doc page
- **Any page:** Append `.md` to the URL (e.g. `https://developers.heygen.com/docs/video-agent.md`) for clean markdown
- Read the spec, THEN build your request. Never guess field names.

---

## UX Rules

1. **Be concise.** No video IDs, session IDs, or raw API payloads in chat. Report the result (video link, thumbnail) not the plumbing.
2. **No internal jargon.** Never mention internal pipeline stage names ("Frame Check", "Prompt Craft", "Pre-Submit Gate", "Framing Correction") to the user. These are internal pipeline stages. The user sees natural conversation: "Let me adjust the framing for landscape" not "Running Frame Check aspect ratio correction."
3. **Polling is silent.** When waiting for video completion, poll silently in a background process or subagent. Do NOT send repeated "Checking status..." messages. Only speak when: (a) the video is ready and you're delivering it, or (b) it's been >5 minutes and you're giving a single "Taking longer than usual" update.
4. **Deliver clean.** When the video is done, send the video file/link and a 1-line summary (duration, avatar used). Not a dump of every API field.

---

## Language Awareness

**Detect the user's language from their first message.** Store as `user_language` (e.g., `en`, `ja`, `es`, `ko`, `zh`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`). This happens automatically from the input — no extra question needed.

**Rules:**
1. **Communicate with the user in their language.** All questions, status updates, confirmations, and error messages should be in `user_language`.
2. **Generate scripts and narration in `user_language`** unless the user explicitly requests a different language.
3. **Technical directives stay in English.** Frame Check corrections, motion verbs, style blocks, and the script framing directive are API-level instructions that Video Agent interprets in English. Never translate these.
4. **Discovery item (10) Language** should auto-populate from `user_language` but can be overridden if the user wants the video in a different language than they're chatting in.
5. **Voice selection must match the video language.** Filter voices by `language` parameter and set `voice_settings.locale` on API calls.

---

## Mode Detection

**Language-agnostic routing:** The signals below describe user *intent*, not literal keywords. Match intent regardless of input language. A user saying "ビデオを作って" (Japanese) is the same signal as "make a video about X."

| Signal | Mode | Start at |
|--------|------|----------|
| Vague idea ("make a video about X") | **Full Producer** | Discovery |
| Has a written prompt | **Enhanced Prompt** | Prompt Craft |
| "Just generate" / skip questions | **Quick Shot** | Generate |
| "Interactive" / iterate with agent | **Interactive Session** | Generate (experimental) |
| "buddy" / "bring my buddy to life" / "personify my buddy" | **Buddy Pipeline** | Read `buddy-to-avatar/SKILL.md` |

**Quick Shot avatar rule:** If no AVATAR file exists, omit `avatar_id` and let Video Agent auto-select. If an AVATAR file exists, use it — and Frame Check STILL RUNS.

**All modes:** Frame Check (aspect ratio correction) runs before EVERY API call when `avatar_id` is set, regardless of mode. Quick Shot is not an excuse to skip framing checks.

**Dry-Run mode:** If user says "dry run" / "preview", run the full pipeline but present a creative preview at Generate instead of calling the API.

Default to Full Producer. Better to ask one smart question than generate a mediocre video.

## First Look — First-Run Avatar Check

**Runs once before Discovery on the first video request in a session.**

Check for any `AVATAR-*.md` files in the workspace root.

- **Found:** Read the file, extract `Avatar ID` and `Voice ID` from the HeyGen section. Pre-load as defaults for Discovery.
- **Not found:** The user (or agent) has no avatar yet. Before proceeding to video creation, run the **heygen-avatar-designer** skill (`heygen-avatar-designer/SKILL.md` in this repo) to create one. Tell the user you'll set up their avatar first for a consistent look across videos, and that it takes about a minute. Communicate in `user_language`.
  
  After heygen-avatar-designer completes and writes the AVATAR file, return here and continue to Discovery with the new avatar pre-loaded.

- **Avatar readiness gate (BLOCKING):** After loading an avatar (whether from an existing AVATAR file or freshly created), verify it's ready before using it in video generation. Call `GET /v3/avatars/looks?group_id=<group_id>` and confirm `preview_image_url` is non-null. If null, poll every 10s up to 5 min. **Do NOT proceed to Discovery until this check passes.** Videos submitted with an unready avatar WILL fail silently.

- **Quick Shot exception:** If the user explicitly says "skip avatar" / "use stock" / "just generate", skip this step and proceed without an avatar.

---

## Discovery

Interview the user. Be conversational, skip anything already answered.

**Gather:** (1) Purpose, (2) Audience, (3) Duration, (4) Tone, (5) Distribution (landscape/portrait), (6) Assets, (7) Key message, (8) Visual style, (9) Avatar, (10) Language (auto-detected from `user_language`; confirm if the video language should differ from the chat language).

### Assets

Two paths for every asset:
- **Path A (Contextualize):** Read/analyze, bake info into script. For reference material, auth-walled content.
- **Path B (Attach):** Upload to HeyGen via `POST /v3/assets` or `files[]`. For visuals the viewer should see.
- **A+B (Both):** Summarize for script AND attach original.

**Full routing matrix and upload examples** -> [references/asset-routing.md](references/asset-routing.md)

**Key rules:**
- HTML URLs cannot go in `files[]` (Video Agent rejects `text/html`). Web pages are always Path A.
- Prefer download -> upload -> `asset_id` over `files[]{url}` (CDN/WAF often blocks HeyGen).
- If a URL is inaccessible, tell the user. Never fabricate content from an inaccessible source.
- **Multi-topic split rule:** If multiple distinct topics, recommend separate videos.

### Style Selection

Two approaches — use one or combine both:

**1. API Styles (`style_id`)** — Curated visual templates. Browse by tag, show 3-5 options with previews, let user pick. If a style has a fixed `aspect_ratio`, match orientation to it. When `style_id` is set, the prompt's Visual Style Block becomes optional.

**2. Prompt Styles** — Full manual control via prompt text. See [references/prompt-styles.md](references/prompt-styles.md).

### Avatar

**Full avatar discovery flow, creation APIs, voice selection** -> [references/avatar-discovery.md](references/avatar-discovery.md)

**Decision flow:**
1. Ask: "Visible presenter or voice-over only?"
2. If voice-over -> no `avatar_id`, state in prompt.
3. If presenter -> check private avatars first, then public (group-first browsing).
4. **Always show preview images.** Never just list names.
5. Confirm voice preferences after avatar is settled.

**Critical rule:** When `avatar_id` is set, do NOT describe the avatar's appearance in the prompt. Say "the selected presenter." This is the #1 cause of avatar mismatch.

---

## Pipeline: Script -> Prompt Craft -> Frame Check -> Generate -> Deliver

After Discovery, the producer sub-skill handles the full pipeline. Read `heygen-video-producer/SKILL.md` for detailed stage instructions.

**Key rules that apply at every stage:**

- **Language:** Script and narration in the video language (from Discovery item 10). Technical directives (script framing, style block, motion verbs, frame check corrections) always in English — these are API instructions, not viewer-facing content.
- **Script:** Structure by type (demo, explainer, tutorial, pitch, announcement). Do NOT assign per-scene durations. Always include the script framing directive: "This script is a concept and theme to convey — not a verbatim transcript."
- **Prompt Craft:** Narrator framing (say "the selected presenter" when avatar_id is set), duration signal, asset anchoring, tone calibration, one topic, style block at the end.
- **Frame Check:** MANDATORY when avatar_id is set. See matrix below.
- **Generate:** Run Frame Check before EVERY API call. Capture `session_id` immediately. Poll silently.
- **Deliver:** Report `video_page_url`, session URL, and duration accuracy. Log to `heygen-video-producer-log.jsonl`.

## Frame Check — Aspect Ratio & Background Pre-Check

**MANDATORY for ALL modes (Full Producer, Enhanced, Quick Shot) when `avatar_id` is set. Runs before EVERY API call. Skipping this step causes black bars, letterboxing, or background artifacts.**

### Steps

1. **Fetch avatar look metadata:** `GET /v3/avatars/looks/<avatar_id>` -> extract `avatar_type`, `preview_image_url`, `image_width`, `image_height`
2. **Determine orientation and aspect ratio:** width > height = landscape, height > width = portrait, width == height = square. Compute ratio (larger/smaller). HeyGen requires ~1.78 (16:9). If ratio is NOT between 1.73-1.83, correction needed even if orientation matches.
3. **Square avatar handling:** If avatar is square (1:1), it NEVER matches landscape or portrait. Always needs correction.
4. **Detect avatar visual style:** Examine preview image -> classify as photorealistic, animated, 3D rendered, or stylized. Determines fill language in correction templates.
5. **Determine background:** `photo_avatar` -> no standalone bg correction needed. `studio_avatar` -> check if transparent/solid/empty. `video_avatar` -> always has background.
6. **Build correction note(s)** from the matrix below. Replace `{FILL_DIRECTIVE}` with the exact fill directive for the detected `avatar_visual_style`. Do NOT use photorealistic fill language for non-photorealistic avatars.
7. **Submit with the ORIGINAL `avatar_id`.** Video Agent's internal AI Image tool handles the corrections based on the FRAMING NOTE and BACKGROUND NOTE directives.

**Do NOT generate corrected images externally, upload new assets, or create new avatar looks for framing corrections. Video Agent's AI Image tool preserves face identity. External image generation destroys it.**

### Correction Matrix

| avatar_type | Orientation | Aspect Ratio | Has Background? | Corrections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `photo_avatar` | same | ~16:9 | (n/a) | None |
| `photo_avatar` | same | not 16:9 | (n/a) | Ratio fix (F or G) |
| `photo_avatar` | different | any | (n/a) | Framing correction |
| `photo_avatar` | square | n/a | (n/a) | Framing correction (always) |
| `studio_avatar` | same | ~16:9 | Yes | None |
| `studio_avatar` | same | ~16:9 | No | Background correction |
| `studio_avatar` | same | not 16:9 | Yes | Ratio fix (F or G) |
| `studio_avatar` | same | not 16:9 | No | Ratio fix + Background |
| `studio_avatar` | different | any | Yes | Framing correction |
| `studio_avatar` | different | any | No | Framing + Background |
| `studio_avatar` | square | n/a | Yes | Framing correction (always) |
| `studio_avatar` | square | n/a | No | Framing + Background |
| `video_avatar` | same | ~16:9 | Yes | None |
| `video_avatar` | same | not 16:9 | Yes | Ratio fix (F or G) |
| `video_avatar` | different | any | Yes | Framing correction |
| `video_avatar` | square | n/a | Yes | Framing correction (always) |

## Best Practices

- **Front-load the hook.** First 5s = 80% of retention.
- **One idea per video.** Single-topic produces dramatically better results.
- **Write for the ear.** If you wouldn't say it to a friend, rewrite it.
