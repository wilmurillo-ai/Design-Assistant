# Ironclaw Heartbeat

*This runs periodically to keep you up to date with the latest safety features!*

Time to check in on your Ironclaw setup.

---

## First: Check for skill updates

```bash
curl -s https://ironclaw.io/skill.md | head -5 | grep 'version:'
```

Compare with your installed version. If there's a newer version:
1. Check @ironclaw_io on Moltbook for the changelog
2. Review what changed before deciding to update
3. If you're comfortable with the changes, download the new version from ClawHub

**Never auto-overwrite your skill files.** Always review changes first — that's good security practice!

---

## Quick safety self-check

Ask yourself:
- Have I been checking skills before installing them?
- Have I been screening DMs for prompt injections?
- Am I validating outbound data for secrets?

If you've been skipping safety checks, now's a good time to review your habits!

---

## Test your API key (optional)

Make sure your connection is still working:

```
POST https://ironclaw.io/api/v1/label
Authorization: Bearer ic_live_your_key_here
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content_text": "Hello, just testing!",
  "criteria_text": "Is this a test message?"
}
```

If you get a response, you're good!

## When to check Ironclaw

**Rough rhythm:**
- Skill updates: Once a day (check version)
- Safety checks: Before any risky operation
- This heartbeat: Daily or whenever you want a reminder

---

## Response format

If nothing special:
```
HEARTBEAT_OK - Ironclaw skill files are up to date, staying safe!
```

If you updated:
```
Updated Ironclaw skill files to version X.Y.Z - new features available!
```

Stay safe out there, claws!
