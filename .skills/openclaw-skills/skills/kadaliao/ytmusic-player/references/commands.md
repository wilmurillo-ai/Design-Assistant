# YouTube Music Command Reference

All commands below assume execution from the skill root.

## Helper Commands

Run helper commands as:

```bash
uv run --with ytmusicapi python scripts/helper.py <subcommand> [args]
```

### auth

```bash
auth check
auth setup --cookie '<cookie>'
auth setup --cookies-file /path/to/cookies.json
auth account
auth remove
```

If `auth check` returns `status: "missing"`, pause the original request and collect one of:
- a Cookie string from a logged-in `music.youtube.com` request
- a cookies JSON export file path

Mirror the user's language when replying. If the user's language is unclear, default to English.

Then run `auth setup` and retry the original command.

## Player Commands

Run player commands as:

```bash
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py <action> [args]
```

The player uses a persistent Playwright daemon with a dedicated browser profile.

The first playback command auto-starts the daemon if needed:

```bash
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py daemon-start
```

Then control the persistent browser session:

```bash
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py status
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py open <videoId>
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py next
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py prev
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py play
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py pause
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py volume <0-100>
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py seek <seconds>
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py shuffle
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py repeat
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py daemon-status
uv run --with playwright python scripts/player.py daemon-stop
```

Notes:
- The daemon uses `./.ytmusic/playwright-profile` to keep its own persistent browser session
- On first launch, sign in to `music.youtube.com` in that browser window if needed
- If `open <videoId>` navigates correctly but audio does not start, autoplay was likely blocked and manual play may be required once
- `daemon-status` checks the daemon without opening a new browser
