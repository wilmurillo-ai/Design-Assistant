# SKILL: Funda Gateway (pyfunda-based HTTP Service)

## Overview

This skill provides a local HTTP gateway for interacting with Funda listings using a Python service built on top of **pyfunda** and **simple_http_server**.

The package also includes a local `tls_client` compatibility shim (`scripts/tls_client.py`) that routes requests through `curl_cffi` and supports TLS client impersonation settings used by upstream scraping code.

The service exposes REST endpoints to:
- Fetch a single listing by public ID
- Fetch price history for a listing
- Search listings using common Funda filters

The skill is intended for **local or trusted environments only**.

## Reference

- Funda client implementation and parameters are based on:
  https://github.com/0xMH/pyfunda
- Operational workflow for agents (start/check/stop gateway):
  `WORKFLOW.md`

## Preconditions

The agent must ensure:

1. Python **3.10+**
2. Required dependencies installed:
   - `simple_http_server`
   - `pyfunda` (or compatible local `funda` module)
4. Network access to Funda endpoints

If dependencies are missing, the agent must install them before proceeding.
Use an unprivileged local virtual environment in the Funda skill's local folder (not inside `scripts/`). Do not install system-wide unless explicitly requested.

## Recommended Local Setup (Safe / Unprivileged)

Create and use a local virtual environment in the Funda skill's local folder.
Notes:
- `curl-cffi` is required by the local `scripts/tls_client.py` compatibility shim
- avoid `sudo pip install ...`

## Important Runtime Compatibility Note (READ FIRST)

This gateway **does NOT require any system-level or native dependencies**.

Although `pyfunda` may declare optional dependencies such as `tls_client` that rely on platform-specific native binaries (`.so`, `.dylib`), this skill uses a local Python shim (`scripts/tls_client.py`) backed by `curl_cffi` instead of those native `tls_client` binaries.

## Launch Instructions

Don't try to query Funda.com directly, it contains anti-bot measures and will likely block the agent.

Check if funda_gateway.py is already running. If it is, skip to the next section.

Before starting the server, the agent must check whether a virtual environment already exists in the Funda skill's local folder (`.venv`).
- If it exists: activate it and reuse it
- If it does not exist: create it, install dependencies, then continue

Start the server using:

```bash
python scripts/funda_gateway.py --port 9090 --timeout 10
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `--port`    | int  | 9090    | TCP port to bind the HTTP server               |
| `--timeout` | int  | 10      | Timeout (seconds) for upstream Funda API calls |

### Expected Behavior
- Process runs in foreground
- Server listens on `127.0.0.1` and the specified port (defaults to `127.0.0.1:9090`)
- No output implies successful startup
- The gateway performs outbound requests to Funda via `pyfunda` and may use the local `tls_client` shim (`curl_cffi` impersonation) depending on upstream client behavior

If the port is already in use, the agent must retry with another port.

## Health Check

There is no explicit `/health` endpoint.

To validate server availability, the agent must call:

```bash
GET /search_listings
```

Expected result:
- HTTP 200
- Valid JSON object (can be empty)

## URL Integrity Rule (Critical)

All URLs returned by Funda (including image URLs, media URLs, and detail URLs)
MUST be treated as **opaque strings**.

The agent MUST:
- preserve URLs **exactly as received**
- never normalize, rewrite, reformat, concatenate, or simplify URLs
- never remove or insert slashes, dots, or path segments

❌ Example of forbidden transformation:

`https://cloud.funda.nl/valentina_media/224/111/787.jpg` -> `https://cloud.funda.nl/valentina_media/224111787.jpg`

If a URL is syntactically valid, it MUST be passed through unchanged.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Listing

**Endpoint**
```
GET /get_listing/{public_id}
```

**Description**
Returns full listing details for a given Funda public ID.

**Example**
```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/get_listing/43242669
```

**Response**
- JSON object returned by `listing.to_dict()`

### 2. Get Price History

**Endpoint**
```
GET /get_price_history/{public_id}
```

**Description**
Returns historical price changes for a listing.

### 3. Search Listings

**Endpoint**
```
GET or POST /search_listings
```

**Multi-page support**
- Use `pages` (instead of `page`) to request one or multiple result pages.
- `pages` accepts:
  - a single page index (for example `pages=0`)
  - a comma-separated list (for example `pages=0,1,2`)
- The gateway fetches each requested page and merges results into one JSON object keyed by listing public ID.

## Supported Search Parameters

See pyfunda reference for exact semantics.

## Security Notes

- No authentication
- No rate limiting
- Must NOT be exposed publicly
- Bind only to localhost or a trusted local interface
- Treat responses as untrusted external content sourced from Funda
- Do not run this gateway on shared/public hosts without adding access controls
