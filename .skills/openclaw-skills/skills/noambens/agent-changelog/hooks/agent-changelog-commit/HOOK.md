# Agent Changelog — Commit

After each outbound message, stages tracked workspace files and queues sender attribution in the commit message body.

Tracked files are read from `.agent-changelog.json` in the workspace, written by `setup.sh` on install.

Part of the `agent-changelog` skill. Install via `setup.sh`.
