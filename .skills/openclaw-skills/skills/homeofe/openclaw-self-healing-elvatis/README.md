# openclaw-self-healing-elvatis

**Current version: `0.2.13`**

OpenClaw plugin that improves resilience by automatically fixing reversible failures.

## What it heals

- **Model outage** — Detect rate limit / quota / auth-scope failures, put model into cooldown, patch pinned session to a safe fallback
- **WhatsApp disconnect** — If WhatsApp appears disconnected repeatedly: restart the gateway (streak threshold + minimum restart interval guard)
- **Cron failures** — If a cron job fails repeatedly: disable it + create a GitHub issue
- **Plugin crashes** — If a plugin reports `status=error` or `status=crash`: auto-disable + GitHub issue

## Changelog

### v0.2.13 — 2026-04-10
**Docs: version bump for clean publish pipeline trigger**
Version bump to trigger npm + ClawHub publish via GitHub release CI.
Includes all v0.2.12 fixes plus updated handoff docs.

### v0.2.12 — 2026-04-10
**Fix: Default model fallback order used Google Gemini CLI as last resort**
The default `modelOrder` included `google-gemini-cli/gemini-2.5-flash` as the final fallback.
Google Gemini CLI models have no system permissions (cannot write files or execute tools),
making the plugin non-functional when all higher-priority models were in cooldown.

Updated default order to use only models with full system/write permissions:
1. `vllm/cli-claude/claude-sonnet-4-6` (Claude CLI — full permissions)
2. `openai-codex/gpt-5.1` (OpenAI Codex — write access)
3. `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6` (Copilot-routed Claude — write access)

Also fixed mismatch between `DEFAULT_MODEL_ORDER` in code and the `openclaw.plugin.json`
schema default — both now use the same values.

### v0.2.11 — 2026-03-19
**Feature: Heal metrics export to JSONL**
Heal events are now written to `~/.aahp/metrics.jsonl` (configurable via `metricsFile` config key).
Each entry is a JSON line with `ts`, `plugin`, `event`, and event-specific fields:
- `{ ts, plugin, event: "model-cooldown", model, reason, cooldownSec, trigger }`
- `{ ts, plugin, event: "session-patched", sessionKey, oldModel, newModel, trigger }`
- `{ ts, plugin, event: "whatsapp-restart", disconnectStreak }`
- `{ ts, plugin, event: "cron-disabled", cronId, cronName, consecutiveFailures }`
- `{ ts, plugin, event: "model-recovered", model, isPreferred }`

Metrics writes are skipped in dry-run mode. The parent directory is created automatically.
Closes #12.

### v0.2.10 — 2026-03-08
Docs fix: README and STATUS.md version headers were stuck at 0.2.8 after v0.2.9 bump; SKILL.md missing version footer; add universal release-rule to CONVENTIONS.md.

### v0.2.9 — 2026-03-07
**Fix: Plugin health monitoring JSON parsing**
Extract JSON from stdout before parsing — channels subprocess output includes
non-JSON log lines (e.g. `[INFO] ...`) before the JSON payload, causing parse
failures in plugin health checks.

### v0.2.8 — 2026-03-07
**Fix: Infinite gateway restart loop**
`lastRestartAt` and `disconnectStreak` are now saved to disk **before** calling
`openclaw gateway restart`. Previously they were saved after, but systemd kills
the process during restart — state was never persisted, the rate-limit guard was
bypassed on every boot, causing an infinite restart loop when used alongside
any plugin that triggers a config-driven gateway restart (e.g. `openclaw-cli-bridge-elvatis`).

### v0.2.7 — 2026-03-07
Fix `runCommandWithTimeout` call signature + field name.

### v0.2.6 — 2026-03-02
Status snapshot file, startup config validation, integration tests.

### v0.2.5 and earlier
Model failover, WhatsApp reconnect, cron failure, dry-run mode, active recovery probing, config hot-reload.

## Install

From ClawHub:

```bash
clawhub install openclaw-self-healing-elvatis
```

For local development:

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ~/.openclaw/workspace/openclaw-self-healing-elvatis
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Config

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-self-healing": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "modelOrder": [
            "vllm/cli-claude/claude-sonnet-4-6",
            "openai-codex/gpt-5.1",
            "github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6"
          ],
          "cooldownMinutes": 300,
          "autoFix": {
            "patchSessionPins": true,
            "disableFailingPlugins": false,
            "disableFailingCrons": false,
            "issueRepo": "elvatis/openclaw-self-healing-elvatis"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`autoFix.issueRepo` must use `owner/repo` format. Invalid values are ignored and the plugin falls back to `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` (if valid) or `elvatis/openclaw-self-healing-elvatis`.

### Config validation

The plugin validates configuration at startup and refuses to start if any value is invalid. All validation errors are logged via `api.logger.error` before the plugin exits.

| Key | Valid range | Default |
|-----|------------|---------|
| `modelOrder` | At least one entry (non-empty array) | 3 default models |
| `cooldownMinutes` | 1 - 10080 (1 minute to 1 week) | 300 |
| `probeIntervalSec` | >= 60 | 300 |
| `autoFix.whatsappMinRestartIntervalSec` | >= 60 | 300 |
| `stateFile` | Parent directory must be writable | `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/self-heal-state.json` |
| `statusFile` | Path to status snapshot JSON | `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/self-heal-status.json` |

## Status file

On every monitor tick (60s), the plugin writes a JSON status snapshot to `statusFile`. External scripts, dashboards, or other plugins can poll this file without subscribing to the event bus.

Default path: `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/self-heal-status.json`

The file is written atomically (write to `.tmp` then rename) to prevent partial reads. The JSON structure matches the `StatusSnapshot` type:

```json
{
  "health": "healthy | degraded | healing",
  "activeModel": "vllm/cli-claude/claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "vllm/cli-claude/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "status": "available | cooldown",
      "cooldownReason": "rate limit (only when in cooldown)",
      "cooldownRemainingSec": 1234,
      "nextAvailableAt": 1700001234,
      "lastProbeAt": 1700000900
    }
  ],
  "whatsapp": {
    "status": "connected | disconnected | unknown",
    "disconnectStreak": 0,
    "lastRestartAt": null,
    "lastSeenConnectedAt": 1700000000
  },
  "cron": { "trackedJobs": 2, "failingJobs": [] },
  "config": { "dryRun": false, "probeEnabled": true, "cooldownMinutes": 300, "modelOrder": ["..."] },
  "generatedAt": 1700000000
}
```

Fields `cooldownReason`, `cooldownRemainingSec`, `nextAvailableAt`, and `lastProbeAt` on model entries are only present when the model is in cooldown.

## Notes

Infrastructure changes remain ask-first.

## Critical Guardrail: openclaw.json validation

This plugin treats `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` as a boot-critical file.

Before any self-heal action that could restart the gateway or change cron/plugin state, it verifies:
- the config file exists
- it is valid JSON

If the config is invalid, the plugin will refuse to restart the gateway to avoid restart loops.

It also creates timestamped backups before restarts or disruptive changes:
`~/.openclaw/backups/openclaw.json/openclaw.json.<timestamp>.bak`
