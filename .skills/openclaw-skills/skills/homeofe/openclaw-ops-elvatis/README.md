## GitHub Actions

### openclaw-triage-labels

Automated issue labeling across all `elvatis/openclaw-*` repositories. Runs daily at 06:00 UTC and can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

Applies labels based on keyword analysis:
- `security` - security-related issues (CVE, vulnerability, XSS, etc.)
- `bug` - bug reports (crash, error, regression, etc.)
- `needs-triage` - everything else that has not been triaged yet

#### Cross-repo PAT setup (required for multi-repo triage)

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to `openclaw-ops-elvatis` only. To label issues in sibling repos (`openclaw-memory-core`, `openclaw-gpu-bridge`, etc.), you must configure a fine-grained Personal Access Token:

1. Go to [GitHub token settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
2. Create a fine-grained PAT with:
   - **Repository access**: All repositories (or select all `elvatis/openclaw-*` repos)
   - **Permissions**: Issues (Read and write), Metadata (Read)
3. Go to this repo's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**
4. Add a repository secret named `TRIAGE_GH_TOKEN` with the PAT value

Without `TRIAGE_GH_TOKEN`, the workflow gracefully skips repos where it lacks permissions (no 403 errors - just a warning in the logs).

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ~/.openclaw/workspace/openclaw-ops-elvatis
openclaw gateway restart
```
