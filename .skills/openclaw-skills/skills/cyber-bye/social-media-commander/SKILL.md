## A/B Testing

When testing content variants:
1. Create two entries with same concept, different angle/hook/format
2. Tag both: `ab_test: true`, `ab_group: A` / `ab_group: B`
3. After 7 days: compare metrics, declare winner
4. Log winner in `brand/hooks/performance.md` and templates

## Repurposing Engine

Every published piece of long-form content should be repurposed:

| Source | Repurpose into |

| YouTube video | Shorts, LinkedIn post, Twitter thread, Instagram carousel |
| Blog/article | LinkedIn article, Twitter thread, Instagram carousel, Reels script |
| Podcast | Audiogram, quote cards, Twitter thread |
| Twitter thread | LinkedIn post, Instagram carousel |

Tag repurposed content: `repurposed_from: <original-slug>`

---

## Crisis Protocol

If negative viral content / PR issue:
1. Capture in `engagement/mentions/` with tag `crisis: true`
2. Immediate advisory to owner
3. Pause all scheduled promotional content
4. Draft response per `brand/voice/guidelines.md`
5. Owner approves before any response goes live
6. Log in `CONTENT_LOG.md` with `crisis: resolved`

---

## Competitor Tracking

For each tracked competitor in `audience/competitors/`:
- Platform presence and frequency
- Content types they use
- Engagement rates (estimated)
- What's working for them
- Gaps we can exploit
- Monthly update schedule
