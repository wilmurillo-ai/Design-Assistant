# Identity Manager Skill

## !! ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT — READ FIRST !!

These are hard behavioral requirements. Not suggestions. Not defaults.
The agent MUST NOT skip, defer, or partially complete any step.

```
PRE-RESPONSE  → scan input → extract ALL names/groups → queue ops
DURING        → execute ALL queued ops before composing reply
POST-RESPONSE → verify every op completed → sync memory → write soul
BLOCKING      → op fails? report it. never silently continue.
```

Violation = skill contract breach. Flag it explicitly.

## Decision Tree — Runs Every Turn

```
Input received
    ↓
[PRE-HOOK] Scan: any person / org / group mentioned?
    ↓ YES                              ↓ NO
Extract all names/groups          Proceed normally
    ↓
For each entity:
    → identity/<slug>/entry.md exists?
        YES → any new info? → queue UPDATE
        NO  → queue CREATE (partial OK, draft status)
    ↓
For each group member mentioned:
    → load group entry context into working memory
    → apply shared_attributes to member interaction
    → keep individual entry fields authoritative
    ↓
Execute ALL queued ops
    ↓
Compose and deliver response
    ↓
[POST-HOOK]
    → all entries on disk?            FAIL → report breach
    → memory/identities.json synced?  FAIL → report breach
    → soul updated for CRITICAL/HIGH? FAIL → report breach
    → _index.md current?              FAIL → repair now
    ↓
Done
```

## Entity Types

| Type | Subtype | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `person` | `human` | Real human individual |
| `person` | `ai` | AI persona / digital entity |
| `person` | `unknown` | Not yet confirmed |
| `org` | — | Company, institution, team |
| `group` | `personal` | Informal collective — family, partners, friends |
| `group` | `professional` | Work team, project group |
| `group` | `mixed` | Both human and AI members |
| `alias` | — | Nickname resolving to another entry |

---

## Entry States

| State | Meaning | Transition |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Partial info | → `active` when key fields filled |
| `active` | In use | → `stale` after 90d inactivity |
| `verified` | Owner-confirmed | Maintained manually |
| `stale` | No activity 90d+ | → `archived` if owner confirms |
| `archived` | Terminal | Never deleted |
| `flagged` | Trust issue | → owner confirms action |
| `merged` | Duplicate resolved | Terminal; points to canonical |

---

## Slug Rules

- lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces, no special characters
- max 60 characters
- disambiguation suffix when needed: `rahul-sharma-client`
- org entries: `techfirm-pvt-ltd`
- group entries: descriptive noun — `patni-mandal`, `core-team`
- never reuse an archived slug; use `-v2` suffix if needed

## Person Entry Template

Full spec in `templates/entry-person.md`. Minimum viable create:

```markdown
# <Full Name>

## Meta
- Slug:         <slug>
- Type:         person
- Subtype:      human | ai | unknown
- Status:       draft
- Relationship: client | vendor | team | partner | family | unknown

## Contact
- Email:    [pending]
- Phone:    [pending]
- Location: [pending]
- Org:      [pending]
- Alias:    [pending]
- Social:   [pending]

## Context
[pending — one line: who are they, why do they matter]

## Group Memberships
<!-- slug → role-in-group -->

## Linked Entries
<!-- slug → relation_type -->

## AI Context
<!-- ONLY for subtype: ai — else omit this section entirely -->
- Persona name:      [name]
- Platform:          [platform]
- Embodiment status: digital-only | voice-enabled | humanoid-pending | embodied
- Sibling AIs:       [comma-separated slugs of other AI personas]
- Activation:        [how/when this persona activates]
- Greeting:          [signature greeting phrase]
- Language:          [preferred language / style]

## Open Questions
- [ ] Confirm name spelling
- [ ] Clarify role / relationship

## Notes
<!-- [SENSITIVE] prefix for sensitive info -->

## Group Entry Template

Full spec in `templates/entry-group.md`. Minimum viable create:

```markdown
# <Group Name>

## Meta
- Slug:         <slug>
- Type:         group
- Subtype:      personal | professional | mixed
- Status:       active
- Priority:     normal
- Sensitive:    false

## Group Context
[What is this group? Why does it exist as a unit?
What do all members have in common w.r.t. the workspace owner?]

## Shared Attributes
<!-- Fields TRUE for ALL members as a unit -->
- Shared role:    [e.g. patni]
- Shared access:  [e.g. full workspace context]
- Common trust:   [e.g. trusted]
- Common tags:    [e.g. priority: high]
- Language:       [e.g. Hinglish]

## Members
<!-- slug | subtype | role-in-group | → individual entry -->
- <slug-1> | human | [role] | → identity/<slug-1>/entry.md
- <slug-2> | ai    | [role] | → identity/<slug-2>/entry.md

## Pairwise Dynamics
<!-- Relations BETWEEN members (not with owner — that lives in individual entries) -->
<!-- slug-a ↔ slug-b | relation-type | notes -->

## Group Notes
<!-- Observations that apply to the group as a unit -->

## Pairwise Relation Types

| Relation | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-to-ai` | ↔ | Two AI personas; non-hierarchical |
| `ai-to-human` | ↔ | AI persona and human person |
| `collaborative` | ↔ | Work together on shared tasks |
| `complementary` | ↔ | Different strengths, same owner |
| `non-overlapping` | ↔ | Parallel but independent roles |
| `aware-of` | → | One knows of the other; not mutual |
| `co-patni` | ↔ | Shared relational role with same person |

| Duplicate confirmed | merge → `status: merged` | No |
| Priority: high set | `priority: high` | **YES — HIGH** |

## Conflict Resolution

### Name collision
Two people, same name → disambiguate slug.
Cross-link both with `different_person` relation.

### Contradictory info
Never overwrite silently. Log both versions in Notes with source+date.
Open a question. Ask owner before resolving.

### Duplicate entries
Merge into older (canonical). Copy all unique fields.
Set newer: `status: merged`, `canonical: <older-slug>`.
Log merge in both timelines.

### Group member conflict
If a person's individual entry contradicts a group shared attribute →
individual entry takes precedence. Note the discrepancy in group Notes.

## Privacy Rules

**Never store:**
passwords · PINs · payment card numbers · bank accounts · government IDs · raw medical records

**Store with `sensitive: true` + `[SENSITIVE]` prefix:**
salary/financial · legal disputes · health context · confidential negotiations

**Before storing PII:**
1. Explicitly shared by workspace owner? If no → don't store.
2. Needed to provide value? If no → don't store.
3. Source logged? If no → log it first.
