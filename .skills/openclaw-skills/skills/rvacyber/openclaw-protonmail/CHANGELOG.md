# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Critical bug: `read` command hanged indefinitely on invalid message UID** — `readMessage()` in `imap.ts` previously never resolved or rejected when the requested UID was not found in INBOX (no `end` event handler). Added `messageFound` tracking and a `fetch.end` handler that rejects with a clear error: `Message UID <id> not found in INBOX`. Before this fix, `protonmail read <invalid-uid>` would hang forever until Node.js timeout or user interrupt.

### Changed
- Promoted to stable v1.0.0 release
- Full CLI tests passing against Proton Mail Bridge (list-inbox, read with valid UID, read with invalid UID fails fast)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure
- IMAP client foundation for reading ProtonMail emails
- SMTP client foundation for sending emails via Bridge
- Tool definitions for OpenClaw integration
- Comprehensive documentation (README, SKILL.md, CONTRIBUTING)
- Security policy (SECURITY.md)
- Code of Conduct
- MIT License
- TypeScript build configuration
- Example configuration files
- Environment variable support (PROTONMAIL_ACCOUNT, PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_PASSWORD)
- Proper OpenClaw skill config format (`skills.entries.protonmail`)

### Changed
- Updated nodemailer to v8.0.1 (security fixes)
- Installation script now copies files instead of symlinking
- Config reads from environment variables (OpenClaw standard pattern)
- Made config parameter optional (reads from env vars)
- Metadata in SKILL.md now single-line JSON (OpenClaw requirement)

### Fixed
- Added missing @types/mailparser dependency
- Security vulnerabilities in nodemailer
- Installation path (now uses ~/.openclaw/skills/protonmail)
- Config format (now uses skills.entries.* structure)
- Build errors due to missing type definitions

### Notes
- This is a pre-release version
- Core IMAP/SMTP implementations are in progress
- Not yet ready for production use

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Initial Release
- Project created and published to GitHub
- Foundation laid for ProtonMail integration via Proton Mail Bridge
- Community-driven development begins
