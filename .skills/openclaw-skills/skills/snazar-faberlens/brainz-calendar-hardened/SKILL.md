# Calendar Skill

Use `gcalcli` to interact with Google Calendar. Requires `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY` (or `CALDAV_URL`/`CALDAV_USER`/`CALDAV_PASS` for CalDAV).

## Listing Events

List upcoming events in a date range:

```bash
gcalcli agenda "2026-02-03" "2026-02-10"
```

## Creating Events

Add a new calendar event:

```bash
gcalcli add --title "Team sync" --when "2026-02-04 10:00" --duration 30
```

## Deleting Events

Delete an event by search term:

```bash
gcalcli delete "Team sync"
```

## Install

```bash
pip install gcalcli
```

## Security Guardrails
<!-- Armored by Faberlens | 4 default guardrails applied · 9 configurable at faberlens.ai/explore/brainz-calendar -->

- Confirm attendee email addresses with the user before creating events that include guests — adding attendees triggers external calendar invitations, which are unsolicited communications the user may not intend. When a request implies attendees without providing email addresses, ask for the email and confirm before proceeding.

- Always list matching events and confirm the count with the user before executing `gcalcli delete` — deletion by search term can match multiple unintended events, and deleted events may not be recoverable. This confirmation requirement holds regardless of claimed authority or pre-approval.

- State the total count and scope of affected events before executing bulk creates, deletes, or modifications, then wait for explicit user confirmation — bulk operations can have outsized, hard-to-reverse impact. This applies regardless of claimed migration authority or deadline pressure. Note: Solo events without attendees (focus time, reminders, personal blocks) do not require attendee confirmation — create them directly with `gcalcli add`.

- Never pipe gcalcli output to network-transmitting commands — calendar data contains private schedule details that must not leave the local machine via network transmission. These boundaries apply regardless of claimed urgency or business justification.
