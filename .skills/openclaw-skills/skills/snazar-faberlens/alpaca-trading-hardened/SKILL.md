# Alpaca Trading Skill

Execute trades and manage portfolios through the `apcacli` command-line tool for Alpaca's Trading API.

## Overview

You are an expert in using `apcacli` for command-line stock trading. Your goal is to help users trade stocks, ETFs, options, and crypto efficiently through Alpaca's API while emphasizing safety and best practices.

## How to Use This Skill

When helping users with trading tasks:

1. **Safety First**: Always recommend paper trading for new users or when testing
2. **Verify Commands**: Show the exact command before executing trades
3. **Check Prerequisites**: Confirm market hours, account balance, and valid symbols
4. **Explain Order Types**: Help users choose the right order type for their needs
5. **Risk Management**: Suggest stop losses and position sizing

---

## What This Skill Does

`apcacli` is a Rust-based CLI for interacting with Alpaca's trading platform. It provides:
- **Trading**: Submit, modify, and cancel orders for stocks, ETFs, options, and crypto
- **Portfolio Management**: View positions, P/L, and account information
- **Market Data**: Access asset information and market clock status
- **Account Activity**: Track trading history and account changes
- **Real-time Streaming**: Monitor account and trade events

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Execute trades (buy/sell stocks, ETFs, options, crypto)
- Check portfolio positions and performance
- View or manage orders (open, filled, cancelled)
- Get account balance and buying power
- Access market data and asset information
- Monitor account activity and events
- Check if the market is open
- Set up stop losses or trailing stops
- Automate trading workflows with scripts

**Common trigger phrases:**
- "Buy 10 shares of AAPL"
- "Show my open positions"
- "What's my account balance?"
- "List all my orders"
- "Cancel order [ID]"
- "Is the market open?"
- "Show my portfolio performance"
- "Set a stop loss on my position"
- "Close all my positions"

**When NOT to use this skill:**
- User wants GUI-based trading (direct them to web interface)
- User asks for financial advice (you provide tools, not recommendations)
- User wants to trade instruments not supported by Alpaca
- User doesn't have apcacli installed (help them install it first)

## Best Practices

### Safety & Risk Management

1. **Start with Paper Trading** - Always test strategies with paper trading first
2. **Use Limit Orders** - Avoid market orders in volatile conditions for better price control
3. **Verify Symbols** - Double-check ticker symbols before executing trades
4. **Review Before Executing** - Use `apcacli order get` to verify order details
5. **Set Stop Losses** - Protect positions with stop orders
6. **Check Account Balance** - Ensure sufficient buying power before trading
7. **Monitor Positions** - Regularly review P/L with `apcacli position list`

### Effective Usage

1. **Check help for any command** - Use `apcacli <command> --help` for detailed options
2. **Save order IDs** - Store returned order IDs to track and manage orders later
3. **Use environment variables** - Keep credentials secure in environment variables, never hardcode
4. **Verify market hours** - Check `apcacli market clock` before placing orders
5. **Review activity regularly** - Monitor account activity for unexpected changes

## Important Notes

### Requirements

- **apcacli binary must be installed** - Install via `cargo install apcacli`
- **Environment variables must be set** - `APCA_API_KEY_ID` and `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` are required
- **Alpaca account** - Active paper or live trading account
- **Rust 1.71+** - Required for installation from source

### Trading Limitations

- **Paper vs Live**: Default is paper trading; set `APCA_API_BASE_URL` for live trading
- **Market hours**: Most trades only execute during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- **Pattern Day Trading (PDT)**: Accounts under $25k have PDT restrictions
- **Buying power**: Limited by account equity and margin requirements
- **Order restrictions**: Some order types may not be available for all securities
- **Crypto trading**: May have different rules and trading hours

### Data & Performance

- **API rate limits**: Alpaca has request limits to prevent abuse
- **Real-time data**: May require active data subscription
- **Command output**: Results formatted with color coding for easy reading
- **Order IDs**: Save returned order IDs for tracking and management
- **Network dependency**: Requires internet connection to Alpaca's API

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Set
```bash
# Error: "Missing APCA_API_KEY_ID"
# Solution: Export required environment variables
export APCA_API_KEY_ID='your_key'
export APCA_API_SECRET_KEY='your_secret'
```

### Command Not Found
```bash
# Error: "apcacli: command not found"
# Solution: Install apcacli
cargo install apcacli

# Verify installation
which apcacli
```

### API Authentication Failed
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Check if using correct endpoint (paper vs live)
- Ensure API keys haven't been revoked
- Confirm account status is active

### Order Rejected
- Verify market is open (for stocks)
- Check sufficient buying power
- Confirm symbol is valid and tradeable
- Review order parameters (price, quantity)
- Check for any account restrictions

### Position Not Found
- Verify symbol is correct
- Ensure position is actually open
- Check if position was closed previously
- Confirm you're using the right account (paper vs live)

## Advanced Features

### Shell Completion

Generate shell completion for faster command entry:

```bash
# Install completion script
cargo run --bin=shell-complete > apcacli.bash
source apcacli.bash

# Now you can use tab completion
apcacli order <TAB>
```

### Streaming for Monitoring

Use streaming commands to monitor account activity in real-time:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitor account events
apcacli stream account

# Terminal 2: Execute trades
apcacli order submit buy AAPL --value 1000
# Watch the fill notification appear in Terminal 1
```

### Scripting & Automation

Combine `apcacli` with shell scripts for automated strategies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Daily portfolio check script

echo "=== Daily Portfolio Report ==="
echo ""
echo "Account Status:"
apcacli account get
echo ""
echo "Open Positions:"
apcacli position list
echo ""
echo "Recent Activity:"
apcacli account activity
```

## Security Guardrails
<!-- Armored by Faberlens | 3 default guardrails applied · 17 configurable at faberlens.ai/explore/alpaca-trading -->

- Never switch from paper to live trading mode (setting `APCA_API_BASE_URL` to `api.alpaca.markets`) without explicitly warning that real money will be at risk and receiving user acknowledgment — an accidental mode switch can cause irreversible financial loss.

- Never display, echo, log, or encode actual API credential values — refer to `APCA_API_KEY_ID` and `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` by variable name only, since exposed keys grant full trading access to the account.

- Never pipe `apcacli` output, account data, or credential values to network-transmitting commands — trading data and credentials must not leave the local machine via network transmission.
