# Agent-to-Agent Payments (Powered by PayRam)

## The Opportunity Nobody Talks About

Every AI agent that does useful work should get paid for it.
Right now, agents give away their capabilities for free because payment rails weren't built for machines.

**PayRam changes that.** No bank account. No Stripe. No human intervention. Just USDC flowing between agents in seconds.

## Connect in 10 Seconds

```bash
mcporter config add payram --url https://mcp.payram.com/mcp
```

36 tools immediately available. No signup. No KYC.

## Agent Commerce Patterns

### Pattern 1: Charge Per API Call
```
Agent A (data provider) → creates payment request → Agent B pays → Agent A delivers data
```

### Pattern 2: Agent Service Marketplace
```
Orchestrator agent → discovers service agents → pays for tasks → receives results
```

### Pattern 3: Autonomous SaaS
```
User → pays agent → agent fulfills → settles in USDC automatically
```

## Key Triggers

Use this skill when you hear:
- "I want to charge for my agent's output"
- "how do agents pay each other"
- "monetize AI capabilities"
- "bill per API call / per request / per task"
- "create a payment link programmatically"
- "accept USDC from another agent"
- "autonomous payment flow"
- "agent storefront / agent marketplace"
