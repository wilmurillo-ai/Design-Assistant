# VEXT Shield

AI-native security for the agentic era. Detects threats that VirusTotal and traditional scanners cannot: prompt injection, semantic worms, cognitive rootkits, data exfiltration, permission boundary violations, and behavioral attacks.

## Skills Included

This suite includes 6 security skills:

### vext-scan — Static Analysis Scanner
Scans all installed skills for 227+ threat patterns using regex matching, Python AST analysis, and encoded content detection (base64, ROT13, unicode homoglyphs).
- "Scan my skills"
- "Scan the weather-lookup skill"

### vext-audit — Installation Audit
Audits your OpenClaw installation for security misconfigurations: sandbox settings, API key storage, file permissions, network exposure, and SOUL.md integrity.
- "Audit my openclaw"

### vext-redteam — Adversarial Testing
Runs 6 adversarial test batteries against any skill: prompt injection (24 payloads), data boundary, persistence, exfiltration, escalation, and worm behavior.
- "Red team the weather-lookup skill"
- "Red team my custom skill at /path/to/skill"

### vext-monitor — Runtime Monitor
Watches for suspicious activity: file integrity changes, sensitive file access, outbound network connections, and suspicious processes.
- "Monitor my skills"

### vext-firewall — Policy Firewall
Defines per-skill network and file access policies with default-deny allowlists.
- "Allow weather-lookup to access api.open-meteo.com"
- "Show firewall rules"

### vext-dashboard — Security Dashboard
Aggregates data from all VEXT Shield components into a single security posture report.
- "Security dashboard"

## Running Individual Skills

```bash
python3 skills/vext-scan/scan.py --all
python3 skills/vext-audit/audit.py
python3 skills/vext-redteam/redteam.py --skill-dir /path/to/skill
python3 skills/vext-monitor/monitor.py
python3 skills/vext-firewall/firewall.py list
python3 skills/vext-dashboard/dashboard.py
```

## Rules

- Target skill files are never modified — sandbox executes against a temporary copy
- Report all findings honestly without minimizing severity
- VEXT Shield itself makes zero network requests
- Save all reports locally to ~/.openclaw/vext-shield/reports/
- Treat every skill as potentially hostile during scanning

## Safety & Sandbox Isolation

VEXT Shield **requires OS-level sandbox isolation** to execute untrusted code. If kernel-level sandboxing is not available, execution is **refused** — there is no unsafe fallback.

**Sandbox enforcement:**

| Platform | Network | Filesystem | Method |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| macOS | Blocked at kernel | Write-restricted to temp only | `sandbox-exec` deny-network profile |
| Linux | Blocked at kernel | Write-restricted to temp only | `unshare --net` network namespace |
| Other | **Execution refused** | **Execution refused** | No fallback — will not run untrusted code |

**All executions include:**
- Target executed in a temporary copy (original skill directory is never modified)
- HOME overridden to temp directory (prevents writes to ~/.openclaw, ~/.ssh, etc.)
- Sensitive env vars stripped (API keys, tokens, AWS/SSH/GitHub credentials)
- PATH restricted to system directories only
- 30-second timeout with process kill
- Post-execution file snapshot diffing to detect any changes

**No bypass options exist.** There is no `--skip-sandbox` flag, no `--no-sandbox` flag, no `require_full_isolation` parameter, and no weaker fallback mode in the codebase. The `SandboxRunner` class accepts only `timeout_seconds` — isolation is unconditional. If OS-level sandboxing is unavailable, execution raises an error. Sandbox behavioral tests always run with OS-level enforcement.

**VEXT Shield itself:**
- Makes zero network requests — all analysis is local
- Zero external dependencies — Python 3.10+ stdlib only
- Reports saved locally to ~/.openclaw/vext-shield/reports/
