# Wallet Policies (Privy)

Privy wallet policies enforce guardrails on transaction signing. Policies are evaluated inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) before any signing occurs — they cannot be bypassed by application code.

## Overview

Policies restrict what transactions a wallet can sign:

- **Transaction value caps** — Maximum ETH/token value per transaction
- **Destination allowlists** — Only sign transactions to approved contract addresses
- **Chain restrictions** — Limit signing to specific chains
- **Method restrictions** — Only allow specific contract method calls
- **Key export prevention** — Prevent extraction of the private key

## Configuring Policies

Policies are configured via the Privy dashboard or API. See [Privy policy documentation](https://docs.privy.io/controls/policies/overview) for the full reference.

### Via API

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.privy.io/v1/wallets/$PRIVY_WALLET_ID/policy" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$PRIVY_APP_ID:$PRIVY_APP_SECRET" | base64)" \
  -H "privy-app-id: $PRIVY_APP_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @policy.json
```

## Recommended Policies

### Agent Trading — Conservative

Suitable for automated agents executing swaps and NFT purchases with tight guardrails.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "Limit transaction value",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "field_source": "ethereum_transaction",
          "field": "value",
          "operator": "lte",
          "value": "100000000000000000"
        }
      ],
      "action": "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "name": "Allow OpenSea Seaport",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "field_source": "ethereum_transaction",
          "field": "to",
          "operator": "eq",
          "value": "0x0000000000000068F116a894984e2DB1123eB395"
        }
      ],
      "action": "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "name": "Restrict to supported chains",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "field_source": "ethereum_transaction",
          "field": "chain_id",
          "operator": "in",
          "value": ["1", "8453", "137", "42161", "10"]
        }
      ],
      "action": "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "name": "Deny everything else",
      "conditions": [],
      "action": "DENY"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Agent Trading — Permissive

For trusted agents with higher limits and broader destination access.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "Limit transaction value",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "field_source": "ethereum_transaction",
          "field": "value",
          "operator": "lte",
          "value": "1000000000000000000"
        }
      ],
      "action": "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "name": "Restrict to supported chains",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "field_source": "ethereum_transaction",
          "field": "chain_id",
          "operator": "in",
          "value": ["1", "8453", "137", "42161", "10"]
        }
      ],
      "action": "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "name": "Deny everything else",
      "conditions": [],
      "action": "DENY"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tips

1. **Start conservative** — Begin with tight value caps and a narrow allowlist, then relax as needed
2. **Use chain restrictions** — Limit to chains you actively trade on
3. **Monitor policy violations** — Privy logs denied transactions in the dashboard
4. **Separate wallets for separate concerns** — Use different wallets (and policies) for swaps vs. NFT purchases
5. **Never disable policies in production** — Keep at least a value cap active
