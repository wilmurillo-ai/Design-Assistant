## [FEAT-20260401-001] feature
**Logged**: 2026-04-01T00:00:00+08:00
**Status**: pending
**Pattern-Key**: workflow.auto_commit.conditional

### What Happened
The auto-commit script commits all changes every time, with no way to selectively ignore .log or other temporary files, creating noisy commit history.

### Root Cause
The script was designed without an ignore/exclude mechanism and no extension points were预留.

### How To Avoid Next Time
Automation scripts must include ignore/exclude extension points and clearly document which file types should not enter the commit.
