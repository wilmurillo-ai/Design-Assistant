## [LRN-20260401-001] correction
**Logged**: 2026-04-01T00:00:00+08:00
**Status**: pending
**Pattern-Key**: workflow.redundancy.multi_path_different_oversight

### What Happened
Two paths were designed for the same function: one where the AI directly promotes insights in memory-daily-distill, and another that follows the A/B/C/D user-confirmation path.

### Root Cause
There was no design-level check for "only one path per outcome with consistent user oversight." This led to a path with weaker supervision bypassing the main path's authority.

### How To Avoid Next Time
Before adding a new workflow path, ask: "Does this path do the same thing as an existing one? Do the oversight levels match?" If yes — merge the paths.
