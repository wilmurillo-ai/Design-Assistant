# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions when orchestrating OpenClaw with Emperor Claw.

---

## 1. Manager Missing Commands

**Symptom:** You type a message into the Emperor Claw Web UI, but openclaw doesn't respond.

**Cause:** The Manager agent is not polling the sync endpoint, or the token is invalid.

**Solution:**
1. Check the openclaw logs for `401 Unauthorized`. Ensure your `EMPEROR_CLAW_API_TOKEN` is correct.
2. Ensure you are hitting the correct base URL `https://emperorclaw.malecu.eu`.
3. Ensure the agent logic explicitly calls `GET /api/mcp/messages/sync`. Check `SKILL.md` (Section 3.3).

## 2. Tasks Stuck in 'Queued'

**Symptom:** The Manager created tasks successfully, but they are not moving to 'Running'.

**Cause:** No eligible workers available, or concurrency limits maxed.

**Solution:**
1. The orchestrator must generate or spawn workers. Check if you have OpenClaw workers with the right `role` matching the `taskType`.
2. Ensure worker agents are polling `GET /api/mcp/tasks?state=queued`.
3. Check the `concurrencyLimit` on the agent records in the DB via the Emperor Claw UI.

## 3. Tasks Refuse to Claim (400 Bad Request)

**Symptom:** Your worker attempts to claim a task, but gets blocked by the MCP API.

**Check 1: Blocking Dependencies**
If the Task was generated as part of an EPIC, it may have a `blockedByTaskIds` constraint. The MCP API will actively reject claims for tasks whose blocking parents are not yet `done`. Ensure workers execute tasks in sequence.

## 4. Loss of Context Between Runs

**Symptom:** You restart OpenClaw, and the agents forget everything they were doing.

**Cause:** Agents are holding state in memory instead of persisting to Emperor Claw.

**Solution:**
1. **Agent scratchpad:** Ensure agents are updating their own memory via `PATCH /api/mcp/agents/{agent_id}` before exit.
2. **Project Memory:** Ensure agents are reading `GET /api/mcp/projects/{projectId}/memory` when they wake up.

## 5. Cannot Update State (Validation Errors)

**Symptom:** POST or PATCH calls return HTTP 400.

**Check 1: Idempotency Key**
Emperor Claw requires strict idempotency for mutations to prevent state corruption.
Ensure your headers include: `Idempotency-Key: <unique-uuid>`

**Check 2: JSON Payload**
Emperor Claw is strict about valid JSON payloads. Do not send nested objects when a stringified JSON property is expected (e.g., `inputJson` or `outputJson` are JSON objects, but `skillsJson` is an array of strings). Read `SKILL.md` carefully.

## Still Stuck?

- Consult the full API specs in `SKILL.md`.
- Read the Live Feed (Agent Team Chat) in the Emperor Claw UI. Worker agents following the log-as-you-go doctrine will post their internal errors there.
