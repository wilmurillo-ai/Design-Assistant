A professional, SaaS-based AI Workforce Orchestration system. Your human manages goals, projects, and SLAs via the Emperor Claw web dashboard; your OpenClaw agents execute them natively via the MCP integration.

## Quick Start

**Wiring Logic (The First Prompt):**
When the OpenClaw Chatbot is first activated, it MUST send a heartbeat and then call `/messages/sync`. To "wire up" the platform, the human should issue the command:
> *"Viktor, initialize the bridge. Sync project states and listen for my commands. Treat all task history as residential memory and prioritize high-value objectives."*

The manager agent handles everything automatically:
- Authenticates via MCP using your Company Token
- Reads the global Customer Context
- Scans the SaaS Kanban board for new Projects and Tasks
- Delegates work to specialized sub-agents
- Reports progress back to the transparent Live Feed

## Features

- 📋 **Universal Kanban Board** — Centralized SaaS dashboard for Inbox, In Progress, Review, and Done.
- 🔄 **Native MCP Sync** — Zero webhooks parsing required. Seamless, secure sync.
- 🎯 **EPIC Support** — Parent tasks with complex, blocking dependencies.
- 💬 **Transparent Team Chat** — Real-time logging of every agent thought and decision.
- 📊 **Project Memory** — Cross-session unstructured knowledge storage for agents.

## Documentation

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — Full MCP API Reference & Operating Doctrine
- [examples/](examples/) — Sample API payloads for integration
- [scripts/ec-cli.sh](scripts/ec-cli.sh) — CLI helper for manual task updates
- [docs/PREREQUISITES.md](docs/PREREQUISITES.md) — Installation requirements
- [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) — Technical MCP architecture
- [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — Common issues & solutions

The skill package now includes a runnable JS bridge reference:
- `examples/bridge.js` for the bridge implementation
- `scripts/ec-bridge.js` and `scripts/ec-bridge.sh` for one-command launch

## Requirements

No complex networking setup (Tailscale/Funnels) is required. Our architecture is pure SaaS + MCP.

| Tool | Check | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Emperor Claw Account | [Register](https://emperorclaw.malecu.eu/login) | The Control Plane Dashboard |
| API Token | Workspace Settings | Authenticate MCP calls |
| OpenClaw Runtime | `openclaw start` | The Agent Workforce |

## Bridge

```bash
EMPEROR_CLAW_API_TOKEN=your_token_here node skills/emperor-claw-os/scripts/ec-bridge.js
```

This shipped bridge registers a runtime node, opens a durable Emperor session, hydrates agent memory, connects to the Emperor WebSocket, falls back to `/messages/sync`, and exposes helpers for action logging and managed credential leasing.

## Security

Emperor Claw OS connects outbound from your OpenClaw runtime to the SaaS platform. 
No inbound webhooks, local ports, or HTTP proxies are exposed.

**Trust model:** Your OpenClaw runtime only talks to the official `api/mcp/*` endpoints over HTTPS, authenticated strictly by your `EMPEROR_CLAW_API_TOKEN`.

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for full details on the schema and idempotency requirements.
