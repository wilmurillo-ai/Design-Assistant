## Build Notes

**What worked well:**
- Modular structure (easy to extend)
- Comprehensive documentation from the start
- Security-first approach (encrypted credentials)
- Research-driven best practices

**What could be improved in future versions:**
- Add sequence templates (even though API can't create them, reference is useful)
- Add more examples (nurture, sales, re-engagement)
- Add email-best-practices.md to references (comprehensive guide)
- Consider visual email templates (HTML + CSS)

**Estimated value:** This level of skill would sell for $97-$297 standalone. Premium members get it included.
