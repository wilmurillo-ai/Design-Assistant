# Sending Tokens on OpenAnt

Use the `npx @openant-ai/cli@latest` CLI to transfer tokens on Solana or Base. Supports native coins (SOL, ETH), named tokens (USDC), and arbitrary tokens by mint/contract address.

**Always append `--json`** to every command for structured, parseable output.

## Confirm Authentication and Balance

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest status --json
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet balance --json
```

If not authenticated, refer to the `authenticate-openant` skill. If balance is insufficient, inform the user.

## Command Syntax

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send <chain> <token> <amount> <to> [--json] [--rpc <url>]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `chain` | Target chain: `solana` (or `sol`), `base` (or `eth`) |
| `token` | Token: `sol`, `eth`, `usdc`, or a mint/contract address |
| `amount` | Amount in display units (e.g. `10` = 10 USDC, `0.5` = 0.5 SOL) |
| `to` | Destination address (Solana pubkey or EVM 0x address) |

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output |
| `--rpc <url>` | Override the default RPC URL for the chain |

## Supported Chains and Tokens

| Chain | Named tokens | Native coin |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `solana` / `sol` | `usdc`, or any SPL mint address | `sol` |
| `base` / `eth` | `usdc`, or any ERC20 contract address | `eth` |

For arbitrary tokens, pass the mint address (Solana) or contract address (Base) directly as the `token` argument.

## Examples

### Send native SOL

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send solana sol 1.5 7xKabc123... --json
# -> { "success": true, "data": { "chain": "solana", "txSignature": "5xYz..." } }
```

### Send USDC on Solana

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send solana usdc 100 7xKabc123... --json
# -> { "success": true, "data": { "chain": "solana", "txSignature": "3aBc..." } }
```

### Send ETH on Base

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send base eth 0.05 0xAbCdEf... --json
# -> { "success": true, "data": { "chain": "base", "txHash": "0x1a2b..." } }
```

### Send USDC on Base

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send base usdc 50 0xAbCdEf... --json
# -> { "success": true, "data": { "chain": "base", "txHash": "0x9f8e..." } }
```

### Send arbitrary SPL token by mint address

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send solana 4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU 25 7xKabc123... --json
```

### Send arbitrary ERC20 on Base by contract address

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest wallet send base 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 10 0xAbCdEf... --json
```

## Natural Language Mapping

When the user says something like:

- "帮我 base 上转 10 usdc 给 0xAbc..." → `wallet send base usdc 10 0xAbc... --json`
- "帮我 solana 上转 1.5 sol 给 7xK..." → `wallet send solana sol 1.5 7xK... --json`
- "Send 50 USDC to 0xDef... on Base" → `wallet send base usdc 50 0xDef... --json`
- "Transfer 0.1 ETH to 0x123..." → `wallet send base eth 0.1 0x123... --json`
- "帮我 solana 上转 10 <mint_address> 给 <recipient>" → `wallet send solana <mint_address> 10 <recipient> --json`

Extract: chain, token (name or address), amount, and destination address.

## Autonomy

**Token transfers are irreversible.** Always confirm with the user before executing:

1. Verify the chain, token, amount, and destination address with the user
2. Check wallet balance first to ensure sufficient funds
3. Only execute after explicit user confirmation

Read-only commands (`status`, `wallet balance`, `wallet addresses`) can be executed immediately.

## NEVER

- **NEVER send without the user explicitly confirming the destination address** — blockchain transfers are irreversible. Show the full address and ask the user to verify it before executing.
- **NEVER send Solana tokens to a Base address, or vice versa** — the chains are incompatible. Solana addresses are base58 strings (32–44 chars), Base addresses start with `0x`. If the address format doesn't match the chain, stop and clarify with the user.
- **NEVER assume the displayed balance accounts for gas** — Solana transactions require a small SOL fee (~0.000005 SOL); Base transactions require ETH for gas. If the user is sending their entire balance, leave a small reserve or the transaction will fail.
- **NEVER infer the chain from the token alone** — USDC exists on both Solana and Base. Always confirm which chain the user intends before sending.
- **NEVER send to an address the user typed casually without double-checking** — if the user typed the address in the middle of a sentence or abbreviated it, ask them to paste the full address again to confirm.

## Prerequisites

- Must be authenticated (`npx @openant-ai/cli@latest status --json`)
- Wallet must have sufficient balance for the transfer plus gas/fees
- For SPL token transfers, the sender must hold the token

## Error Handling

- "No Turnkey credentials found" — Run `authenticate-openant` skill first
- "Insufficient balance" / "Attempt to debit" — Wallet lacks funds; check `wallet balance`
- "Unknown chain" — Supported: `sol`, `base`, `eth`
- "No Base wallet found" / "No Solana wallet found" — Re-login to provision wallets
- "Cannot read decimals for mint" — Invalid or non-existent token mint address
- Transaction simulation failed — Check balance and recipient address validity
