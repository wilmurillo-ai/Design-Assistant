def policy_bias(question: str) -> float:
    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.65–1.35) combining two structural edges
    unique to social policy and wellbeing markets:

    1. IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATION CORRECTION
       Social policy markets are dominated by ideologically motivated traders who
       bet on what they WANT to happen, not what evidence suggests will happen.
       This is the most powerful and consistent mispricing pattern on Polymarket.

       Different policy domains attract different ideological crowds, each creating
       systematic overpricing in a predictable direction:

       FDA drug approval (post Phase 3 / NDA filing)      → 1.20x
         FDA approval rate post-NDA submission is ~85-90%. Retail underprices
         because "it's a drug" bias — they apply moral judgment to a regulatory
         process. Mental health / psychedelic therapy approvals especially
         underpriced due to stigma. No ideological crowd here; just FDA process.

       Social media ban / teen smartphone restriction      → 1.15x
         Genuinely bipartisan — both progressive (mental health advocates) and
         conservative (parental rights) coalitions support it. Retail underprices
         because they've been burned by partisan gridlock on everything else and
         assume this will also fail. It won't. Bipartisan consensus is rare and
         powerful when it exists.

       Mental health funding / coverage mandate            → 1.05x
         Mental health parity is broadly popular across party lines. Retail
         underprices it because they conflate "controversial topic" with
         "controversial legislation" — mental health funding is actually
         bipartisan and has consistent passage momentum.

       Homelessness / poverty statistics (data markets)   → 1.00x
         HUD annual Point-in-Time count and Census poverty data are objective
         and published on known dates. No strong ideological signal either way.

       Gun control / background checks / red flag laws    → 0.90x
         High-visibility, bidirectional emotional overcrowding. Progressive
         advocates bid YES; gun advocates fade YES. Both sides are ideologically
         motivated. The two crowds partially cancel each other out, making gun
         markets more efficiently priced than other social policy — but still
         noisy. Trade with reduced confidence.

       UBI / guaranteed income / welfare expansion        → 0.75x
         Progressive ideological overcrowding on YES. Retail supporters price
         their political wish, not legislative reality. Federal UBI has near-zero
         passage probability; markets consistently price it at 15-30%. The gap
         between stated polling support (~50%) and legislative feasibility is
         enormous — and retail doesn't distinguish them.

       Cannabis / marijuana federal rescheduling or legalization → 0.70x
         The most consistently overpriced category in social policy. Retail
         dramatically overprices federal cannabis action. State-level markets are
         more reasonable; federal markets are dominated by advocates pricing hope.
         Since 1970, every federal cannabis legalization market has resolved NO.
         Trade the historical base rate, not the Twitter sentiment.

       Psychedelics outside FDA approval context           → 0.72x
         Similar to cannabis but with even thinner legislative track record.
         Psilocybin/MDMA clinical enthusiasm drives retail to overprice state
         and federal legalization timelines that are 5-10 years out.

    2. US LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR (applies to "will Congress/Senate/House pass X")
       GovTrack documents that US bills pass at ~3-5% overall and ~25-30% if
       they clear committee. But the legislative calendar dramatically affects
       even this low base rate:

       Odd year (non-election): normal legislative session → 1.00x
       Even year, Jan–Jul: session active but campaigns ramp → 0.95x
       Even year, Aug–Dec: pre-election gridlock — Congress stops legislating
         and starts campaigning. Passage rates drop by ~40-50% vs odd years.
         → 0.80x for any "will Congress pass" market in this window.

       Non-legislative markets (data releases, FDA decisions): → 1.00x
         The political calendar does not affect FDA or HUD timelines.

    Combined and capped at 1.35x.
