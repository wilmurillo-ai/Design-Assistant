def science_bias(question: str) -> float:
    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.55–1.35) combining two structural edges
    unique to science milestone markets:

    1. SCIENCE CLAIM TYPE — HYPE CYCLE vs REPLICATION REALITY
       Science markets are priced by non-experts following journalist headlines.
       Journalists systematically amplify the most optimistic interpretation of
       scientific results. The research community knows the replication rate,
       timeline track record, and definitional ambiguity behind each claim.
       Retail doesn't. This creates large, consistent mispricings by claim type.

       CRISPR / gene therapy clinical milestone          → 1.15x
         clinicaltrials.gov publishes trial endpoints and expected completion
         dates. CRISPR therapies (Casgevy approved 2023) have defined Phase 3
         paths. Regulatory milestones for gene therapy are trackable — retail
         treats them as sci-fi when the FDA approval process is public record.

       Alzheimer / neurodegeneration specific drug       → 1.10x
         Lecanemab (2023) and Donanemab (2024) set precedent for the amyloid
         hypothesis approval path. Post-Phase 3 Alzheimer drug markets are now
         structured similarly to other FDA approvals. Regulatory calendar is
         public; retail still prices with existential uncertainty.

       Nobel Prize (any field)                           → 1.15x (+ timing below)
         Thomson Reuters / Clarivate Citation Laureates has predicted ~40% of
         Nobel winners in advance using citation impact. Importantly: Nobel
         committees reward work done 10–30 years ago that has been thoroughly
         replicated and transformed a field. Retail chases recent hype; Clarivate
         tracks citation longevity. The information is public every September.

       Dark matter / particle physics detection          → 0.85x
         Rare binary events. Multiple experiments (LZ, XENONnT, PandaX) have
         published sensitivity curves and expected timelines. The science is
         trackable but genuine detections are rare — retail doesn't understand
         that "no signal yet" is itself strong data.

       Quantum computing milestone (specific qubit count) → 0.85x
         IBM, Google, and IonQ publish public roadmaps with qubit targets.
         Markets on specific count thresholds are somewhat trackable. But:
         corporate "quantum supremacy" claims are marketing-contaminated and
         frequently contested — apply skepticism to claims from press releases.

       AGI / artificial general intelligence by date     → 0.70x
         The single most definitionally ambiguous claim in science markets.
         "AGI" has no agreed definition — the resolution criteria are almost
         always vague enough that any outcome can be disputed. Retail overprices
         dramatically based on AI hype cycles. Additionally: every AGI timeline
         prediction since 1956 has been wrong. Trade the historical base rate.

       Longevity / aging reversal / lifespan extension   → 0.70x
         Longevity conference culture creates aggressive retail overcrowding on
         YES for "will human lifespan reach 150 by X" type markets. The gap
         between mouse model results (which dominate longevity press) and human
         clinical validation is 10–15 years minimum. Retail collapses this gap.

       Cancer "cure" or universal treatment              → 0.65x
         The most fundamental category error in science markets. "Cancer" is
         200+ distinct diseases with different mechanisms, genetics, and treatment
         paths. A market asking "will a cure for cancer be found by X" contains
         an incoherent premise that virtually guarantees NO regardless of medical
         progress. Retail prices the headline emotion, not the biology.

       Commercial fusion / grid-connected fusion         → 0.65x
         The canonical "5 years away" joke in physics. NIF achieved ignition
         (Q>1) in December 2022 — a genuine historic milestone. But commercial
         fusion (grid-connected, cost-competitive) is a different problem entirely.
         ITER's completion has been delayed from 2016 → 2020 → 2025 → 2035.
         Every commercial fusion company's timeline has slipped by >50%.
         Markets on fusion electricity "by X" are systematically overpriced.

       Room temperature superconductor claim             → 0.55x
         The lowest confidence category. Every major "room temperature
         superconductor" claim since 1987 has either failed replication or been
         retracted. The 2023 LK-99 episode — global excitement, total replication
         failure within two weeks — is the template. Retail gets euphoric;
         physicists know the replication failure rate is near 100%.
         The prior probability of any specific RT superconductor claim surviving
         peer review and replication is extremely low.

    2. NOBEL CALENDAR TIMING
       Nobel Prize announcements follow a precise, known schedule every October.
       Clarivate Citation Laureates publishes its shortlist in late September.
       Both create specific, exploitable timing windows:

       Nobel market + October (announcement week)       → 1.25x
         The committee meets and announces in real-time. Polymarket takes
         15–30 minutes to fully reprice after each announcement. Pre-announcement,
         Clarivate shortlist provides structural edge retail ignores.

       Nobel market + September (Clarivate month)       → 1.15x
         Clarivate shortlist is public. Markets priced without this data
         can be traded against it — retail doesn't read citation databases.

       Nobel market + other months                      → 1.00x

    Combined and capped at 1.35x.
