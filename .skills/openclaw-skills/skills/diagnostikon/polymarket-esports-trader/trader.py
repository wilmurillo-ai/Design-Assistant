def esports_bias(question: str) -> float:
    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.70–1.35) combining three structural edges
    unique to esports and gaming markets:

    1. GAME / MARKET TYPE — DATA RICHNESS AND FAN LOYALTY CORRECTION
       Esports markets are mispriced in two opposite directions simultaneously.
       Data-rich titles (CS2, LoL, Dota 2) with published Elo models are
       dramatically underpinned by retail who ignores them. At the same time,
       fan-favourite teams (T1/Faker) are systematically overcrowded by fanbases
       trading loyalty, not skill assessment. Both are exploitable.

       T1 / Faker markets                                    → 0.75x
         The most overcrowded single-team bias in all of esports. Faker's
         global fandom across all regions bids T1 up 10–20% above Elo-model
         implied win probability in every bracket. Documented in prediction
         market research 2023–2025. This is not about T1 being bad — they
         are elite — it's about the market overpricing them specifically.

       CS2 / Counter-Strike tournament match                → 1.20x
         HLTV.org publishes Elo ratings, map win rates by team, head-to-head
         history, and form streaks. CS2 is the most quantified esport. The
         Elo-to-Polymarket price gap is consistently 8–15% for non-marquee
         matchups that retail hasn't studied.

       League of Legends (non-T1) / LCK / LPL / LEC        → 1.15x
         Oracle's Elixir tracks champion win rates, team stats per patch,
         objective control, and game pace. Patch-level team performance is
         the key signal: a team's win rate can shift 15% after a meta patch
         that nerfs their champion pool. Retail prices reputation; data
         reflects current patch reality.

       Dota 2 / The International / DPC                     → 1.15x
         OpenDota publishes comprehensive match statistics. The International
         bracket is structured (Bo3/Bo5 elimination) — data-driven teams
         outperform expectations because retail values flashy play over
         statistical consistency.

       Valorant / VCT / Masters                             → 1.10x
         VLR.gg growing database of agent win rates, map pools, clutch rates.
         Newer ecosystem but increasingly quantified; retail lags the data.

       Mobile esports (Honor of Kings, PUBG Mobile, MLBB)  → 1.15x
         Dominant Asian player pools with deep local statistics that Western
         Polymarket participants don't access. Korean/Chinese mobile esports
         results hit Polymarket with 1–3h lag during Asian hours.

       Game release date milestone                          → 1.10x
         Publisher delay history is documented and trackable. Developers who
         have delayed previous titles 1–2 times have ~70% probability of
         delaying again. Retail prices release dates optimistically.

       Twitch / streaming peak viewership milestone         → 1.10x
         TwitchTracker publishes daily peak concurrent viewer history. "Will
         X reach Y peak viewers" markets can be calibrated against published
         viewership growth curves. Retail doesn't check TwitchTracker.

       Steam concurrent player milestone                    → 1.10x
         SteamCharts publishes real-time and historical player counts. Game
         launch peaks are predictable from pre-order velocity and publisher
         history. Retail prices hype; data reflects trajectory.

    2. SERIES FORMAT — VARIANCE REDUCTION BY MATCH LENGTH
       Esports bracket markets are priced as if all formats are equal. They
       aren't. A Bo5 Grand Final is dramatically more skill-dominant than a
       Bo1 group stage match. This is the most mechanically reliable edge in
       tournament markets — it requires no external API.

       Bo5 / Grand Final / Championship Match               → 1.20x
         Best-of-5: the statistically stronger team wins ~72–78% of matches.
         Retail treats finals as coin flips because "anything can happen" —
         this is emotionally true but statistically false. The better team's
         edge is near-maximum in Bo5.

       Bo3 / Playoff / Semifinal / Elimination Match        → 1.10x
         Best-of-3: meaningful variance reduction vs Bo1. The stronger team
         wins ~65–70% of matches. Retail still underestimates the gap.

       Bo1 / Group Stage / Swiss Stage / Round Robin        → 0.90x
         Best-of-1: highest upset rate. A 60% win-rate team loses ~40% of
         individual games. Group stage markets have genuine uncertainty —
         reduce conviction significantly.

    3. ASIAN SESSION TIMING FOR KOREAN / CHINESE TEAM MATCHES
       LoL LCK and LPL, Dota 2 SEA, and mobile esports feature Asian teams
       competing during Asian business hours (01:00–09:00 UTC). Polymarket
       is US-dominated — Korean and Chinese match results take 30–90 minutes
       to fully reprice when US retail is asleep or just waking.

       Asian-dominant game + 01:00–09:00 UTC               → 1.15x
       Other time windows                                   → 1.00x

    Combined and capped at 1.35x.
    CS2 Bo5 Grand Final: 1.20 × 1.20 = 1.35x cap.
    T1 Bo3 match: 0.75 × 1.10 = 0.83x — correctly skeptical of fan overcrowding.
    LoL LCK in Asian hours Bo5: 1.15 × 1.20 × 1.15 = 1.35x cap.
    Bo1 group stage (any game): type_mult × 0.90 — edge compressed.
