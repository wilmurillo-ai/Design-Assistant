oil prices, and energy policy milestones.

SAFE BY DEFAULT:
- No --live flag = paper trading (venue="sim"), zero financial risk.

    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.75–1.40) combining two energy transition
    structural edges:

    1. ENERGY DATA CALENDAR TIMING
       Different energy sub-sectors have well-defined data release rhythms where
       professional markets reprice and Polymarket retail lags:

       EV / battery + Q1 (Jan–Mar):
         IEA and BloombergNEF publish prior-year EV sales totals in Jan–Feb.
         Biggest data update of the year — retail pricing lags by weeks. → 1.20x

       Solar / wind / renewable capacity + Q4 (Oct–Dec):
         Year-end installation rush — projects race to complete before Dec 31.
         IEA and IRENA confirm GW additions in Q4. → 1.20x

       Oil / OPEC + OPEC meeting months (Jun, Dec):
         OPEC+ biannual ministerial meetings drive oil threshold markets.
         Since 2022, OPEC+ has surprised with production cuts 70%+ of the time.
         Uncertainty — and therefore edge — peaks in the pre-meeting window. → 1.15x

       Natural gas / LNG + winter peak (Nov–Feb):
         Gas demand and storage drawdown narratives drive LNG price markets
         in the Northern hemisphere winter. → 1.10x

       Other / off-cycle: → 1.00x

    2. TECHNOLOGY TIER CONFIDENCE
       Energy sub-sectors have dramatically different predictability based on
       data availability and whether pricing is driven by hard data or narrative.

       Nuclear restart / SMR approval        → 1.25x
         Regulatory timelines are public record from national nuclear authority
         filings. US retail is poorly informed on European/Asian nuclear policy —
         enormous information asymmetry.

       OPEC production cut / oil supply      → 1.20x
         OPEC+ has surprised with cuts 70%+ of the time since 2022.
         Retail systematically underprices — they expect OPEC to do nothing.

       Solar / wind GW capacity milestones   → 1.20x
         IEA and IRENA publish confirmed project pipelines. Markets on
         "will X GW be installed by Y" frequently underprice the published data.

       EV adoption / market share / sales    → 1.15x
         IEA monthly data lags Polymarket pricing by 1–2 months.
         Chinese BYD sales data provides even earlier leading signal.

       Oil price threshold (Brent / WTI)     → 1.10x
         Directional OPEC+ bias is documented, but daily volatility adds noise.

       Natural gas / LNG                     → 1.10x
         Winter demand is predictable; storage data from EIA is public weekly.

       Carbon / net zero policy pledge       → 0.80x
         Government net-zero commitments almost never resolve cleanly on time.
         Retail overprices policy sincerity. Ambiguity = poor resolution signal.

       Hydrogen / green hydrogen milestone   → 0.75x
         Perennial "5 years away" technology — retail consistently overprices
         hydrogen milestones that get pushed back. Cost-curve reality lags hype.

    Combined and capped at 1.40x.
