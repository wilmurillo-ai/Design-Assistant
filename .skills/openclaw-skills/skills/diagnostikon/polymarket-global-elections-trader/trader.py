def election_bias(question: str) -> float:
    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.70–1.35) combining two structural edges
    unique to global election markets:

    1. ELECTORAL SYSTEM TYPE — HOW PREDICTABLE IS THIS OUTCOME?
       Electoral systems have radically different outcome distributions. Retail
       on Polymarket trades all elections as if they were US presidential races
       (two candidates, coin flip). They aren't. Understanding the system is
       the core alpha in this domain.

       Two-party / FPTP "will X win" (UK, Australia, Canada)  → 1.20x
         First-past-the-post systems amplify polling leads into landslide
         probabilities. A party with a 5% polling lead has ~80-85% win probability,
         not 55%. Retail systematically underestimates this amplification because
         they anchor to the raw poll margin, not the seat-translation model.
         UK constituency-level polling (Electoral Calculus) makes this trackable.

       Runoff / second-round election (France, Brazil, many) → 1.15x
         After the first round, the runoff polling is dramatically more accurate
         than first-round polling. Head-to-head matchup polling post-round-1
         typically has <3% error. Retail treats runoffs with the same uncertainty
         as first rounds — a significant mispricing. Markets on "who wins the
         runoff" immediately after round-1 results are underpriced on the leading
         candidate.

       Referendum (binary yes/no) (Brexit, IndyRef, etc.)    → 1.10x
         Cleaner resolution criteria than multi-candidate races. Well-polled in
         most democratic countries. Retail overcomplicates these.

       Snap election / early dissolution                      → 0.85x
         Called with little notice — no steady polling baseline, high news-driven
         volatility. The incumbent calling the snap usually has a structural
         advantage that retail underestimates, but the timing uncertainty
         dominates. Trade cautiously.

       Coalition formation / government composition           → 0.80x
         Who forms the coalition after an election is driven by multi-party
         negotiation dynamics that are genuinely unpredictable — party veto
         players, policy distance, personal relationships. Polling tells you
         who won seats, not who governs. Trade with significant caution.

       No-confidence vote / leadership challenge              → 0.80x
         Parliamentary arithmetic matters but so does timing of defections,
         backbench rebellions, and party discipline. Hard to model without
         real-time whip counts.

       PR system "will X win an outright majority"            → 0.70x
         The sharpest dampening in this category. In proportional representation
         systems (Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Israel), a single
         party winning an outright majority of seats is extremely rare — typically
         <5% base rate. Retail prices these markets at 15-30% because they project
         US presidential race logic onto parliamentary systems. It almost never
         happens. Every "will X win a majority in the Bundestag/Riksdag/Knesset"
         question is a structural NO unless polling shows >45% for one party.

    2. REGIONAL INFORMATION LAG — THE POLYMARKET BLINDSPOT
       Polymarket is overwhelmingly US-English-speaking. Non-English-language
       polling updates reach Polymarket traders with a systematic lag of 12–48h.
       Local-language polling aggregators update daily; Polymarket prices don't.
       This is the most exploitable structural gap in election markets.

       German / French / Dutch / Scandinavian elections      → 1.20x
         Wahlrecht.de (Germany), Politico Europe, Votecompass — daily polling
         aggregators in German/French/Dutch that US retail doesn't monitor.
         The lag between a 3-point swing in Wahlrecht and Polymarket repricing
         is 12-36 hours. This is the richest information lag in the category.

       Brazilian / Latin American elections                  → 1.15x
         DataFolha and Quaest (Brazil) publish daily tracking polls in
         Portuguese. CIEP (Mexico), CNC (Argentina) similarly. High-quality
         polling that US retail rarely reads. Runoff races especially.

       South / Southeast Asian elections                     → 1.15x
         India (CSDS, ABP-CVoter), Indonesia (LSI, Indikator), Philippines
         (Pulse Asia) publish local-language tracking. Indian exit polls in
         particular are released in local languages hours before English
         coverage catches up. Enormous audience + lag = large edge.

       UK / Australian / Canadian elections (English)        → 1.05x
         Well-covered in English but less so than US elections. Electoral
         Calculus (UK) and YouGov MRP models give structural edges that
         Polymarket retail underweights.

       Sub-Saharan Africa / fragile democracies              → 0.75x
         Low polling quality (sample sizes, access), high institutional
         volatility. Election outcomes regularly include coup risk, result
         disputes, and logistical delays that make clean resolution uncertain.
         Trade very conservatively — resolution risk is material.

    Combined and capped at 1.35x.
    German FPTP (UK-style): 1.20 × 1.20 = 1.35x cap.
    PR majority question in Germany: 0.70 × 1.20 = 0.84x — correctly skeptical.
    Brazilian runoff: 1.15 × 1.15 = 1.32x — strong, data-backed edge.
