def equity_bias(question: str) -> float:
    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.65–1.40) combining two structural edges
    unique to equity prediction markets:

    1. MARKET TYPE / EARNINGS BASE RATE CORRECTION
       Equity markets run in parallel with the deepest, most quantified financial
       markets in the world. The edge on Polymarket is the LAG: retail prices
       equity outcomes using headlines and gut feeling while professional data
       (options implied volatility, earnings base rates, futures term structure)
       is sitting in public databases they never check.

       Large-cap tech earnings beat (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, META, GOOG, AMZN) → 1.25x
         These companies beat Wall Street consensus EPS estimates ~80–85% of the
         time, sustained across multiple years. Nvidia beat consensus 7 consecutive
         quarters 2022–2024. Apple beats ~80%. Meta beats ~85%. Retail prices
         these as ~50–60% likely to beat — a 20–30 percentage point gap that
         is pure edge. Options implied volatility (available free from Yahoo
         Finance) gives a precise probability band for the earnings move; Polymarket
         consistently misprices vs the options-implied range.

       General S&P 500 earnings beat (any large company)           → 1.15x
         The most underknown stat in all of equity markets: S&P 500 companies
         beat analyst consensus EPS estimates approximately 73–75% of the time
         historically. This rate has been consistent across multiple cycles.
         Retail has no idea. They price earnings beats as coin flips. Every
         "will X beat earnings?" market is a structural YES lean unless the
         company has a specific documented miss history.

       Index level milestone (S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow reaching X)    → 1.15x
         S&P 500 futures market is a 24-hour reference. Polymarket markets on
         index thresholds take 20–60 minutes to reprice after major macro
         catalysts (CPI prints, payrolls, FOMC decisions). This is especially
         large during pre-market hours when futures have already moved but
         Polymarket participants haven't absorbed the move yet.

       Dividend / buyback / stock split announcement               → 0.90x
         Corporate decisions with some information leakage (insider buying
         patterns, SEC pre-disclosure windows) but timing is genuinely
         uncertain. Trade with moderate caution.

       IPO by date / IPO valuation milestone                       → 0.85x
         Banker and market-condition driven. IPO windows are real but timing
         within a window is hard to predict. S-1 filing dates are public but
         the gap from filing to pricing is highly variable.

       Market crash / correction / bear market by date             → 0.75x
         The single most reliably overpriced category in equity prediction
         markets. "Will the S&P fall 20% by X?" Retail dramatically overprices
         crash scenarios for any specific calendar window because crashes are
         vivid and memorable but statistically rare in any given period.
         VIX-spike periods create especially overcrowded crash markets — retail
         fears anchor to the worst case when mean reversion is the more likely
         outcome.

       Short squeeze / meme stock milestone                        → 0.65x
         Pure retail sentiment and social media coordination. GME/AMC-style
         squeezes require specific short float data, borrow rate spikes, and
         coordinated retail buying — all of which are impossible to predict
         from the question text alone. Lowest edge category in equity markets.

    2. EARNINGS CALENDAR TIMING
       Earnings beat/miss markets have dramatically stronger signal during
       earnings season. Outside earnings season, only pre-announcements and
       guidance updates trickle in — the market lacks the data density to
       price these questions accurately, which means the base rate edge
       (73–75% beat rate) is noisier and less actionable.

       Earnings-type question + peak season (Jan, Feb, Apr, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Nov)
         → 1.20x: Maximum signal density; options implied vol is fresh; analyst
         estimates are current; company guidance is recent.

       Earnings-type question + off-season (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec)
         → 0.85x: Sparse data; retail prices on stale information from
         last quarter; estimates drift.

       Index/macro question + quarter-start month (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
         → 1.10x: GDP advance estimate + earnings flood + FOMC + NFP all land
         in quarter-start months. Maximum macro catalyst density.

    Combined and capped at 1.40x.
    Large-cap tech earnings in peak season: 1.25 × 1.20 = 1.40x cap — maximum edge.
    Market crash question any time: 0.75x — always trade defensively.
    Short squeeze: 0.65x — near MIN_TRADE floor regardless of probability.
