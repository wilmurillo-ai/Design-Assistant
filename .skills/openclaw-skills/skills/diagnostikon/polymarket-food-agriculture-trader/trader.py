def harvest_cycle_bias(question: str) -> float:
    """
    Returns a conviction multiplier (0.75–1.40) combining two agricultural
    structural edges:

    1. CROP CALENDAR / WASDE TIMING
       Agricultural markets have their highest information asymmetry at two
       points: (a) during the planting window (Mar–May) when yield uncertainty
       peaks, and (b) around USDA WASDE report months (Jun, Aug, Nov, Jan) when
       professional traders have better reads than retail on what the report
       will show. Outside these windows, edge compresses.

       Crop question + WASDE high-impact month (Jun, Aug, Nov, Jan) → 1.20x
       Crop question + planting season (Mar–May)                    → 1.15x
       Crop question + S. hemisphere harvest (Jan–Apr, soy/corn)    → 1.10x
       Crop question + off-season                                    → 0.90x
       Non-crop question                                             → 1.00x

    2. COMMODITY TYPE CONFIDENCE
       Different agricultural sub-categories have vastly different predictability
       based on supply concentration, data availability, and narrative vs data
       pricing.

       Cocoa / coffee (W. Africa + Brazil concentration)  → 1.25x
         Supply is ~70% concentrated in a few countries — weather events
         in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, or Brazil are strong, front-runnable signals.

       Wheat / corn / soy / grain / oilseed (USDA-driven) → 1.20x
         WASDE is the most data-rich public report in commodities — professional
         futures markets lead; Polymarket retail lags by days.

       Fertilizer / potash / nitrogen (input prices)      → 1.15x
         Upstream agricultural inputs move on Russian export policy and energy
         prices — longer lead times than retail appreciates.

       Alternative protein / lab-grown meat               → 1.10x
         FDA/USDA FSIS approval milestones are public record — regulatory
         calendar creates predictable resolution timing that retail ignores.

       Food inflation / CPI / FAO index                   → 1.05x
         Lagged, well-reported data — moderate edge at best.

       Famine / food crisis / food security               → 0.75x
         Humanitarian narratives create emotional pricing — geopolitical
         complexity makes timing very hard.

       Drought / wildfire crop damage                     → 0.85x
         Already heavily covered in media — crowded trade, edge mostly gone
         by the time a Polymarket question is created.

    Combined and capped at 1.40x.
