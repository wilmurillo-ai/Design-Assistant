# Write ADR

Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from decisions made during the current session.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Context** - Gather repository context and existing ADRs
2. **Extract** - Analyze conversation for decisions using a subagent
3. **Confirm** - Present decisions to user for selection
4. **Write** - Generate ADRs in parallel using subagents
5. **Report** - Summarize created files and status
6. **Verify** - Validate generated ADRs against Definition of Done

## Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
# Get current branch and recent commits
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -5

# Check for existing ADRs
ls docs/adrs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No ADR directory found"

# Count existing ADRs for numbering
find docs/adrs -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

This context helps the ADR writer:
- Reference related commits in the ADR
- Avoid duplicate ADRs for already-documented decisions
- Determine correct sequence numbering

## Step 2: Extract Decisions

Launch a subagent to analyze the current conversation for architectural decisions:

```text
Task(
  description: "Analyze conversation and extract architectural decisions",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: |
    Load the skill: Skill(skill: "beagle-analysis:adr-decision-extraction")

    Analyze the conversation for decisions that warrant ADRs:
    - Technology choices, architecture patterns, design trade-offs
    - Rejected alternatives, significant implementation approaches

    Return JSON:
    {
      "decisions": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore",
          "context": "Brief context about why this came up",
          "decision": "What was decided",
          "alternatives": ["What was considered but rejected"],
          "rationale": "Why this choice was made"
        }
      ]
    }
)
```

If the subagent returns an empty `decisions` array, skip to Step 5 with message: "No architectural decisions detected in this session."

## Step 3: Confirm with User

**Display all extracted decisions with full details**, then ask user to select:

```text
## Detected Decisions

### 1. Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore
**Confidence:** high

**Problem:** Need ACID transactions for financial records

**Decision:** PostgreSQL for user data storage

**Alternatives discussed:**
- MongoDB
- SQLite

**Rationale:** ACID compliance, team familiarity, mature ecosystem

**Source:** Discussion about database selection in planning phase

---

### 2. Implement event sourcing for audit trail
**Confidence:** medium

**Problem:** Compliance requires complete audit history

**Decision:** Event sourcing pattern for state changes

**Alternatives discussed:**
- Database triggers
- Application-level logging

**Rationale:** Immutable audit trail, temporal queries, debugging capability

**Source:** Compliance requirements discussion

---

## Selection

Which decisions should I write ADRs for?
- Enter numbers (e.g., "1,2" or "1-2"), "all", or "none" to skip
```

**Important:** Always display the full decision details (problem, decision, alternatives, rationale) from the extraction output BEFORE asking for selection. Do not truncate to just title and context.

Parse user response:
- `"all"` - Process all decisions
- `"none"` or empty - Skip with message "No ADRs will be created."
- `"1,2"` or `"1-2"` - Process specified decisions

## Step 4: Write ADRs (Parallel)

**Pre-allocate ADR numbers before launching subagents** to prevent numbering conflicts:

```bash
# Pre-allocate numbers for all confirmed decisions
# Example: If user selected 3 decisions
python skills/adr-writing/scripts/next_adr_number.py --count 3
# Output:
# 0003
# 0004
# 0005
```

**Assign each pre-allocated number to its corresponding decision** before launching subagents.

For each confirmed decision, launch an ADR Writer subagent in background with its **pre-assigned number**:

```text
Task(
  description: "Write ADR for: {decision.title}",
  model: "sonnet",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: |
    Load the skill: Skill(skill: "beagle-analysis:adr-writing")

    Write an ADR for this decision:
    ```json
    {decision JSON}
    ```

    **IMPORTANT: Use this pre-assigned ADR number: {assigned_number}**

    Instructions:
    1. Explore codebase for additional context
    2. Write MADR-formatted ADR to docs/adr/
    3. Use the pre-assigned number {assigned_number} - DO NOT call next_adr_number.py
    4. Filename format: {assigned_number}-slugified-title.md
    5. Return created file path
)
```

**Critical:** Pass the pre-allocated number to each subagent. Subagents must NOT call `next_adr_number.py` themselves - this causes duplicate numbers when running in parallel.

All subagents run in parallel. Wait for all to complete before proceeding.

## Step 5: Report Results

Collect outputs from all subagents and present summary:

```markdown
## ADR Generation Complete

| File | Decision | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| docs/adr/0003-use-postgresql.md | Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore | Draft |

### Next Steps
- Review generated ADRs for accuracy
- Update status from "proposed" to "accepted" when finalized

### Gaps Requiring Investigation
- [List any decisions where subagent noted missing context]
```

If no decisions were processed:
```text
No ADRs were created. Run this command again after making architectural decisions.
```

## Step 6: Verify Generated ADRs

For each created ADR, validate against Definition of Done:

```markdown
## Verification Checklist

| ADR | E | C | A | D | R | Status |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|--------|
| 0003-use-postgresql.md | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ | ✗ | Incomplete |

Legend: E=Evidence, C=Criteria, A=Agreement, D=Documentation, R=Realization
```

**Verification steps:**
1. Open each generated ADR file
2. Confirm filename follows `NNNN-slugified-title.md` pattern
3. **Verify YAML frontmatter exists at file start:**
   - File MUST begin with `---`
   - Contains `status: draft` (or valid status)
   - Contains `date: YYYY-MM-DD` (actual date)
   - Ends with `---` before title
   - If frontmatter is missing, add it immediately
4. Review for `[INVESTIGATE]` prompts - these need follow-up
5. Verify at least 2 alternatives are documented
6. Confirm consequences section has both Good and Bad items

**If gaps exist:**
- Keep status as `draft` until gaps are resolved
- Use `[INVESTIGATE]` prompts to guide follow-up session
- Schedule review with stakeholders before changing to `accepted`

## Output Location

ADRs are written to `docs/adr/`. If no ADR directory exists, create it with an initial `0000-use-madr.md` template record.

## MADR Format Reference

```markdown

status: draft
date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Decision Drivers

* {driver 1}
* {driver 2}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option}", because {reason}.

### Consequences
