# Review Verification Protocol

This protocol MUST be followed before reporting any code review finding. Skipping these steps leads to false positives that waste developer time and erode trust in reviews.

## Pre-Report Verification Checklist

Before flagging ANY issue, verify:

- [ ] **I read the actual code** - Not just the diff context, but the full function/impl block
- [ ] **I searched for usages** - Before claiming "unused", searched all references
- [ ] **I checked surrounding code** - The issue may be handled elsewhere (trait impls, error propagation)
- [ ] **I verified syntax against current docs** - Rust edition, crate versions, and API changes
- [ ] **I distinguished "wrong" from "different style"** - Both approaches may be valid
- [ ] **I considered intentional design** - Checked comments, CLAUDE.md, architectural context

## Verification by Issue Type

### "Unused Variable/Function"

**Before flagging**, you MUST:
1. Search for ALL references in the codebase (grep/find)
2. Check if it's `pub` and used by other crates in the workspace
3. Check if it's used via derive macros, trait implementations, or conditional compilation (`#[cfg]`)
4. Verify it's not a trait method required by the trait definition

**Common false positives:**
- Trait implementations where the method is defined by the trait
- `#[cfg(test)]` items only used in test builds
- Derive-generated code that uses struct fields
- Types used via `From`/`Into` conversions

### "Missing Error Handling"

**Before flagging**, you MUST:
1. Check if the error is handled at a higher level (caller propagates with `?`)
2. Check if the crate has a top-level error type that wraps this error
3. Verify the `unwrap()` isn't in test code or after a safety-ensuring check

**Common false positives:**
- `unwrap()` in tests and examples (expected pattern)
- `expect("reason")` after validation (e.g., `regex::Regex::new` on a literal)
- Error propagation via `?` (the caller handles it)
- `let _ = tx.send(...)` — intentional when receiver may have dropped

### "Unnecessary Clone"

**Before flagging**, you MUST:
1. Confirm the clone is actually avoidable (borrow checker may require it)
2. Check if the value needs to be moved into a closure/thread/task
3. Verify the type isn't `Copy` (clone on Copy types is a no-op)
4. Check if the clone is in a hot path (test/setup code cloning is fine)

**Common false positives:**
- `Arc::clone(&arc)` — this is the recommended explicit clone for Arc
- Clone before `tokio::spawn` — required for `'static` bound
- Clone in test setup — clarity over performance

### "Potential Race Condition"

**Before flagging**, you MUST:
1. Verify the data is actually shared across threads/tasks
2. Check if `Mutex`, `RwLock`, or atomic operations protect the access
3. Confirm the type doesn't already guarantee thread safety (e.g., `Arc<Mutex<T>>`)
4. Check if the "race" is actually benign (e.g., logging, metrics)

**Common false positives:**
- `Arc<Mutex<T>>` — already thread-safe
- Tokio channel operations — inherently synchronized
- `std::sync::atomic` operations — designed for concurrent access

### "Performance Issue"

**Before flagging**, you MUST:
1. Confirm the code runs frequently enough to matter
2. Verify the optimization would have measurable impact
3. Check if the compiler already optimizes this (iterator fusion, inlining)

**Do NOT flag:**
- Allocations in startup/initialization code
- String formatting in error paths
- Clone in test code
- `.collect()` on small iterators

## Severity Calibration

### Critical (Block Merge)

**ONLY use for:**
- `unsafe` code with unsound invariants
- SQL injection via string interpolation
- Use-after-free or memory safety violations
- Data races (concurrent mutation without synchronization)
- Panics in production code paths on user input

### Major (Should Fix)

**Use for:**
- Missing error context across module boundaries
- Blocking operations in async runtime
- Mutex guards held across await points
- Missing transaction for multi-statement database writes

### Minor (Consider Fixing)

**Use for:**
- Missing doc comments on public items
- `String` parameters where `&str` would work
- Suboptimal iterator patterns
- Missing `#[must_use]` on functions with important return values

### Informational (No Action Required)

**Use for:**
- Suggestions for newtypes, builder patterns, or type state
- Performance optimizations without measured impact
- Suggestions to add `#[non_exhaustive]`
- Refactoring ideas for trait design

**These are NOT review blockers.**

### Do NOT Flag At All

- Style preferences where both approaches are valid (e.g., `if let` vs `match` for single variant)
- Optimizations with no measurable benefit
- Test code not meeting production standards
- Generated code or macro output
- Clippy lints that the project has intentionally suppressed

## Valid Patterns (Do NOT Flag)

### Rust

| Pattern | Why It's Valid |
|---------|----------------|
| `unwrap()` in tests | Standard test behavior — panics on unexpected errors |
| `.clone()` in test setup | Clarity over performance |
| `use super::*` in test modules | Standard pattern for accessing parent items |
| `Box<dyn Error>` in binaries | Not every app needs custom error types |
| `String` fields in structs | Owned data is correct for struct fields |
| `Arc::clone(&x)` | Explicit Arc cloning is idiomatic and recommended |
| `#[allow(clippy::...)]` with reason | Intentional suppression is valid |

### Async/Tokio

| Pattern | Why It's Valid |
|---------|----------------|
| `std::sync::Mutex` for short critical sections | Tokio docs recommend this for non-async locks |
| `tokio::spawn` without join | Valid for background tasks with shutdown signaling |
| `select!` with `default` branch | Non-blocking check, intentional pattern |
| `#[tokio::test]` without multi_thread | Default single-thread is fine for most tests |

### Testing

| Pattern | Why It's Valid |
|---------|----------------|
| `expect()` in tests | Acceptable for test setup/assertions |
| `#[should_panic]` with `expected` | Valid for testing panic behavior |
| Large test functions | Integration tests can be long |
| `let _ = ...` in test cleanup | Cleanup errors are often unactionable |

### General

| Pattern | Why It's Valid |
|---------|----------------|
| `todo!()` in new code | Valid placeholder during development |
| `#[allow(dead_code)]` during development | Common during iteration |
| Multiple `impl` blocks for one type | Organized by trait or concern |
| Type aliases for complex types | Reduces boilerplate, improves readability |

## Context-Sensitive Rules

### Ownership

Flag unnecessary `.clone()` **ONLY IF**:
- [ ] In a hot path (not test/setup code)
- [ ] A borrow or reference would work
- [ ] The clone is not required for `Send`/`'static` bounds
- [ ] The type is not `Copy`

### Error Handling

Flag missing error context **ONLY IF**:
- [ ] Error crosses a module boundary
- [ ] The error type doesn't already carry context (thiserror messages)
- [ ] Not in test code
- [ ] The bare `?` loses meaningful information about what operation failed

### Unsafe Code

Flag unsafe **ONLY IF**:
- [ ] Safety comment is missing or doesn't explain the invariant
- [ ] The unsafe block is broader than necessary
- [ ] The invariant is not actually upheld by surrounding code
- [ ] A safe alternative exists with equivalent performance

## Before Submitting Review

Final verification:
1. Re-read each finding and ask: "Did I verify this is actually an issue?"
2. For each finding, can you point to the specific line that proves the issue exists?
3. Would a Rust domain expert agree this is a problem, or is it a style preference?
4. Does fixing this provide real value, or is it busywork?
5. Format every finding as: `[FILE:LINE] ISSUE_TITLE`
6. For each finding, ask: "Does this fix existing code, or does it request entirely new code that didn't exist before?" If the latter, downgrade to Informational.
7. If this is a re-review: ONLY verify previous fixes. Do not introduce new findings.

If uncertain about any finding, either:
- Remove it from the review
- Mark it as a question rather than an issue
- Verify by reading more code context
