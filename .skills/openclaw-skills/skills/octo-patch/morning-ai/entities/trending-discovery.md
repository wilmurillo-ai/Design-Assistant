## Working Rules

1. **Exclude known entities**: If discovered content belongs to another Agent's entity (e.g., OpenAI, Cursor, etc.), record but mark as "already covered by XX Agent"
2. **Focus on discovery**: Prioritize reporting the following types of discoveries:
   - Brand new AI tools/products debut
   - Open-source projects exploding (star count surge)
   - Important industry events (policy, partnerships, milestones)
   - Influential community discussions or controversies
3. **Scoring criteria**: Follow shared specification, but new tools/projects typically score 3-5, unless widespread attention
