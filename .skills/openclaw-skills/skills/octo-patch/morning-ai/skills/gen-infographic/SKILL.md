description: Generate cover and per-type infographics for AI News Daily
---

## Objective

Generate multiple infographics for the daily report:

1. **Cover infographic** — top 4-5 updates across all types
2. **Per-type infographics** — one for each type that has important (7+) items

---

## Output Specs

| Image | Filename | When to generate | Aspect |
|-------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Cover | `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD.png` | Always (if image gen is enabled) | 9:16 |
| Model | `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_model.png` | Type has 7+ score items | 9:16 |
| Product | `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_product.png` | Type has 7+ score items | 9:16 |
| Benchmark | `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_benchmark.png` | Type has 7+ score items | 9:16 |
| Funding | `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_funding.png` | Type has 7+ score items | 9:16 |
| Combined | `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_combined.png` | Always (final output) | long |

- **Cover uses 9:16 portrait format** — same as per-type sections, for seamless vertical stitching
- **Per-type sections use 9:16 portrait format** — automatically stitched below the cover into a single vertical long image (`_combined.png`)
- **Always generate cover + sections + stitch** — regardless of how many qualifying items exist
- **Format**: PNG

> **`IMAGE_GEN_TYPES` config**: Controls which per-type images to generate. Default: `auto` (only types with 7+ items). Options: `all` (all types with any items), `none` (cover only), or comma-separated types like `model,product`.

---

## Title Format Specification

Each news title **must include three elements**:

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Entity name** | Company/product/organization name | NVIDIA, Cursor, Midjourney |
| **Event subject** | Specific model/product/event name | Alpamayo, Agent mode, V7 |
| **Core event** | Verb phrase describing the event | releases, open-sources, tops leaderboard, closes funding |

### Title Examples

✅ **Correct Examples**:
- NVIDIA Alpamayo Releases Open-Source Autonomous Driving VLA Model
- Cursor Closes $900M Series B Funding
- Midjourney V7 Officially Launches

❌ **Incorrect Examples**:
- Alpamayo 1 (missing entity name and event)
- NVIDIA Alpamayo (missing event description)
- Open-source autonomous driving model released (missing entity name)

## Content Detail Rules

Determine number of points based on score, **but do NOT use `[MAJOR]`/`[MINOR]` tags in Prompt or image**:

| Score | Number of Points | Card Size |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **>= 7** | 3-5 detailed points | Large card (priority display) |
| **< 7** | 2-3 concise points | Small card |

> ⚠️ Score classification is only for guiding content detail level. **Do NOT** use `[MAJOR]`/`[MINOR]` or similar labels in Prompt!

---

## Style Presets

Select a visual style via `IMAGE_STYLE` config (default: `classic`). Insert the matching style block into `{STYLE_BLOCK}` in all prompt templates below.

### `classic` — Clean Editorial Magazine

```
Style: Clean editorial magazine layout. Off-white (#F5F5F0) background with subtle warm gray grid lines. Bold sans-serif header "AI News Daily" in black with a vivid accent color underline. Each card is a white rectangle with soft drop shadow (4px blur, 10% black), separated by generous whitespace. Use a refined accent palette: deep navy (#1A2744) for card titles, muted teal (#2A9D8F) for bullet icons, slate gray (#4A5568) for body text. NO gradients, NO textures, NO background patterns — pure flat white space.
Layout: Cards arranged in a balanced grid with equal gutters (24px). Maximize space for card content (titles and bullet points). Do NOT display score numbers or score badges — let card size and content density convey importance.
Card design: Card title in 18pt bold navy sans-serif, subtitle in 12pt gray italic. Bullet points with small teal dot markers, 14pt regular weight. Thin 1px light gray top-border on each card for subtle separation. NO icons, NO illustrations, NO decorative elements inside cards — text only with strong typographic hierarchy. Prioritize readable text and generous line spacing.
```

### `dark` — Dark Mode

```
Style: Dark mode editorial layout. Deep charcoal (#1A1A2E) background. Bold sans-serif header "AI News Daily" in white (#FAFAFA) with electric blue (#00D4FF) accent underline. Each card is a dark slate (#16213E) rectangle with subtle 1px border in muted blue (#0F3460), separated by generous spacing. Accent palette: white (#FAFAFA) for card titles, soft violet (#7B68EE) for bullet icons, light gray (#B0BEC5) for body text. NO gradients, NO glow effects — clean flat dark surfaces.
Layout: Cards arranged in a balanced grid with equal gutters (24px). Maximize space for card content (titles and bullet points). Do NOT display score numbers or score badges — let card size and content density convey importance.

Each card is a semi-transparent frosted white panel (rgba(255,255,255,0.65)) with backdrop blur effect, rounded corners (16px), and subtle white border (1px, 30% opacity). Accent palette: charcoal (#212121) for card titles, soft indigo (#5C6BC0) for bullet icons, medium gray (#546E7A) for body text. Soft diffused shadows (8px blur, 5% black) behind each card.
Layout: Cards arranged in a balanced grid with generous gutters (28px). Maximize space for card content (titles and bullet points). Do NOT display score numbers or score badges — let card size and content density convey importance.
Card design: Card title in 18pt bold charcoal sans-serif, subtitle in 12pt gray italic. Bullet points with small indigo dot markers, 14pt regular weight. NO hard borders — rely on frosted glass contrast for separation. Clean, airy, modern feel. Prioritize readable text and generous line spacing.
```

### `newspaper` — Classic Newsprint

```
Style: Classic newspaper editorial layout. Warm cream (#FFF8E7) background with very faint paper texture grain. Bold serif header "AI News Daily" in deep black (#1A1A1A) with crimson red (#B71C1C) thin rule line below.

Accent palette: deep black (#1A1A1A) for card titles in bold serif, dark gray (#333333) for bullet text in serif, medium gray (#666666) for subtitles in italic serif.
Layout: Multi-column newspaper grid (2-3 columns). Large stories span full width at top, smaller stories in side-by-side columns below. Separated by horizontal and vertical hairline rules. NO cards, NO boxes — pure typographic layout. Do NOT display score numbers or score indicators — let column placement and headline size convey importance.
Card design: Card title in 18pt bold black serif, subtitle in 12pt gray italic serif. Bullet points with small em-dash markers, 14pt regular serif weight. Feels like the front page of a prestigious broadsheet. Prioritize readable text and generous line spacing.

Layout: Cards arranged in a balanced grid with equal gutters (16px). Compact spacing, information-dense. Maximize space for card content (titles and bullet points). Do NOT display score numbers or score badges — let card size and content density convey importance.
Card design: Card title in 16pt bold green monospace, subtitle in 11pt gray monospace. Bullet points with amber `>` markers, 13pt regular monospace. Thin 1px dim cyan border. Feels like a developer dashboard or terminal readout. Prioritize readable text and generous line spacing.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Determine Images to Generate

From the report, identify:
- **Cover**: Top 4-5 items across all types by score
- **Per-type**: For each type (Model/Product/Benchmark/Funding), check if it has 7+ score items. If yes, generate a per-type image.

### 2. Build Prompts

**Cover prompt**: Use the Cover Prompt Template above.

**Per-type prompt**: Use the Per-Type Prompt Template below.

### Per-Type Prompt Template

```
9:16 portrait infographic, AI News Daily — {Type} Updates, {LANG} text content.

Total news items: {N}

News cards (display EXACTLY {N} cards):

Card 1: {Entity name} {Event subject} {Core event verb phrase}
- {Point 1}
- {Point 2}
- {Point 3}

Card 2: {Entity name} {Event subject} {Core event verb phrase}
- {Point 1}
- {Point 2}

(... list according to actual item count ...)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each card title MUST include: Entity name + Event subject + Event description
- Display complete titles, do NOT truncate
- Do NOT display any labels like [MAJOR], [MINOR], or importance markers
- Do NOT display score numbers, score badges, or any numerical ratings on the image
- Do NOT invent items not listed
- Display ALL bullet points for each card
- Cards arranged vertically (portrait layout), one below another
- Maximize content area — card titles and bullet points are the primary focus
- If fewer than 3 items, use more whitespace and decorative elements
- Do NOT display dates in the header or title — per-type images use "AI News Daily — {Type} Updates" only, without any date

{STYLE_BLOCK}
```

> Adjust the style header text to "AI News Daily — {Type} Updates" when using the preset.

### Combined Prompt Template — not used

> **Removed.** All reports now use Cover (9:16) + Per-Type Sections (9:16) + stitch, regardless of item count.

---

## Image Strategy

Image generation always produces a **single combined long image** as the final output:

1. **Cover** (9:16 portrait): Top 4-5 items across all types — Cover Prompt Template
2. **Per-type sections** (9:16 portrait): One for each type with 7+ score items — Per-Type Prompt Template
3. **Stitch**: Cover + sections vertically into `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_combined.png`

> If only 1-2 qualifying items exist, the cover still generates with extra whitespace. Per-type sections are skipped for types with no 7+ items.

Manifest example:
```json
[
  {"prompt": "<cover prompt>", "output": "news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD.png"},
  {"prompt": "<model section>", "output": "news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_model.png"},
  {"prompt": "<product section>", "output": "news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_product.png"}
]
```

---

### 3. Generate Images

Follow the **Image Strategy** section above — always generate cover + per-type sections + stitch.

**Option A** — Native tool (if supported):
Generate each image using your tool's built-in capability, then stitch.

**Option B** — Python script (default, recommended):
Build a manifest JSON and run with `--stitch`:

```bash
cd {SKILL_DIR} && python3 skills/gen-infographic/scripts/gen_infographic.py --batch {CWD}/manifest.json --stitch
```
> Cover is 9:16 portrait, sections are 9:16 portrait. Requires `pip install Pillow`. Produces `news_infographic_YYYY-MM-DD_combined.png`.

### 4. Post-generation Verification (required)

For each generated image:
- Check card count equals N
- Verify each card title includes complete three elements
- Check if titles are truncated
- Confirm no unprovided content
- Confirm no `[MAJOR]`, `[MINOR]` or similar labels displayed
- Confirm no score numbers or score badges are displayed
- If issues found, regenerate or manually correct

### 5. Insert into Report

- Cover image: at report beginning
- Per-type images: at the top of each type section

## Handling Few Updates

When valid news items < 4, **do NOT pad with fake content**:

| Item Count | Layout Strategy |
|------------|----------------|
| **1 item** | Centered large card + "Today's Highlight" label + whitespace and decorative elements |
| **2 items** | Left-right symmetric or top-bottom stacked |
| **3 items** | Three-column even or pyramid layout |
| **4-5 items** | Standard grid layout |

> **Core principle**: prefer whitespace over fabrication.

---

## Notes

- Title uses "AI News Daily", news content in the target language (default: English, follows `--lang` parameter)
- **Date display rule**: Only the **cover image** header includes the date (`AI News Daily YYYY-MM-DD`). Per-type section images must **NOT** include any date — use `AI News Daily — {Type} Updates` only.
- **`{LANG}`** — substitute with the full language name: "English" (default), "Chinese", "Japanese", etc., based on the `--lang` parameter
- **Strictly generate based on actual item count**, do not force 4-5 items
- **Do NOT use `[MAJOR]`/`[MINOR]` labels in Prompt**
- Use card size and point count to reflect importance differences
- Insert image into report Markdown beginning after generation
- **Popular Model Blocklist**: unless explicitly in report, do not include models/products not in the report
