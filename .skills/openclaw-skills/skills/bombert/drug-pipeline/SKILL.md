# Drug Pipeline Search Skill

This skill converts natural language questions into structured API queries against a pharmaceutical drug database, then presents the results in a readable format.

## Workflow

1. **Parse user intent** — Extract key entities from the user's question
2. **Build query parameters** — Map entities to the query schema below
3. **Execute the query** — Run `scripts/search.py`
4. **Present results** — Format and display drug records to the user

## Step 1: Extract Keywords

Identify the following entity types from the user's question:

| Field | Type | Description                 | Example                                                   |
|-------|------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `drug_name` | `dict` | Drug name(s)                | `{"logic": "or", "data": ["pembrolizumab"]}`              |
| `company` | `List[str]` | Sponsor / developer company | `["Pfizer", "Roche"]`                                     |
| `indication` | `List[str]` | Disease / indication        | `["lung cancer", "NSCLC"]`                                |
| `target` | `dict` | Biological target(s)        | `{"logic": "or", "data": ["PD-1", "VEGF"]}`               |
| `drug_modality` | `dict` | Drug modality / type        | `{"logic": "or", "data": ["antibody", "small molecule"]}` |
| `drug_feature` | `dict` | Drug feature(s)             | `{"logic": "or", "data": ["bispecific"]}`                 |
| `phase` | `List[str]` | Development phase(s)        | `["Preclinical", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "Others", "IND", "Suspended", "Approved", "Unknow", "Withdraw from Market", "BLA/NDA"]`                                 |
| `location` | `List[str]` | Geographic location(s)      | `["China", "United States", "Japan"]`                                        |
| `route_of_administration` | `dict` | Route of administration     | `{"logic": "or", "data": ["IV", "oral"]}`                 |
| `page_num` | `int` | Page index (0-based)        | `0`                                                       |
| `page_size` | `int` | Results per page (1–2000)      | `200`                                                       |

**Dict field format:**
```json
{"logic": "or", "data": ["value1", "value2"]}
```

- `logic` controls how multiple values are combined: `"or"` (any match) or `"and"` (all must match). Default to `"or"` unless the user explicitly wants all terms to apply simultaneously.
- `data` is the list of keyword strings to match.

**Type rules:**
- `company`, `indication`, `phase`, `location` → plain `List[str]`
- `drug_name`, `target`, `drug_modality`, `drug_feature`, `route_of_administration` → `dict` with `logic` and `data`
- Default to `page_num: 0, page_size: 10` unless the user specifies otherwise
- Prefer English keywords (the database is indexed in English); translate non-English terms

## Step 2: Execute the Query

```bash
python scripts/search.py --params '<JSON string>'
```

Or using a parameter file:

```bash
python scripts/search.py --params-file /tmp/query.json
```

Add `--raw` to receive the unformatted JSON response.

## Step 3: Interpret Results

The response contains:
- `page_num` / `page_size` — current pagination state
- `results` — current page of drug records, each with name, phase, modality, targets, companies, indication, development progress, etc.

## Step 4: Review and Fallback Search Strategies
If no results are returned, apply the fallback strategies below before giving up.
When an initial query returns zero or poor results, try these strategies **in order**:

### Strategy 1 — Drug Name Variant Expansion

Drug names in the database may use different formats (with/without hyphens, partial codes, aliases). Expand the `drug_name` field to include common variants and merge deduplicated results.

```json
{
  "drug_name": {"logic": "or", "data": ["SHR-A1904", "SHR A1904", "A1904", "SHR1904"]},
  "page_num": 0,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

**Common variant patterns to try:**
- Remove or replace hyphens: `SHR-A1904` → `SHR A1904`, `SHRA1904`
- Strip prefix/suffix: `9MW-2821` → `MW-2821`, `9MW2821`
- Known alias: include trade names or INN alongside internal codes

---

### Strategy 2 — Company-First with Application-Layer Filtering

When drug name matching is unreliable, use the company as the anchor. Fetch a broad set of the company's drugs, then filter by modality/indication/target in post-processing.

```json
{
  "company": ["Roche", "Roche Inc"],
  "page_num": 0,
  "page_size": 500
}
```

After retrieving results, apply local filters:
- `modality == "Antibody-Drug Conjugates, ADCs"`
- `indication contains "breast cancer"`
- `drug_name matches known code pattern`

Use this strategy when the drug code is ambiguous or the API match rate is low.

---

### Strategy 3 — Broad Target/Modality Search with Post-Filtering

When neither name nor company is reliable, search by biological target and modality, then narrow results client-side.

```json
{
  "target": {"logic": "or", "data": ["CLDN18.2", "Nectin-4", "HER2"]},
  "drug_modality": {"logic": "or", "data": ["Antibody-Drug Conjugates, ADCs"]},
  "page_num": 0,
  "page_size": 200
}
```

After retrieval, filter by company name or drug code pattern using substring matching (e.g. code starts with `SHR`, `9MW`, `A166`).

> **Note:** If the API supports regex, patterns like `(SHR|9MW|A166)` can be passed directly in `drug_name.data` to broaden matching in a single call.

## Decision Tree

```
Initial query returns results?
├── Yes → present results
└── No  → Strategy 1: expand drug_name variants
          └── Still no results → Strategy 2: company anchor + local filter
                                 └── Still no results → Strategy 3: target/modality broad search
Any step hits HTTP 429?
└── Pause entire chain 30s → resume from current strategy
    (sleep ≥5s between every request to avoid triggering 429)
```

## Security & Packaging Notes

- This skill only calls NoahAI official HTTPS endpoints under `https://www.noah.bio/api/` and does not contact third-party services.
- It requires exactly one environment variable: `NOAH_API_TOKEN`. Store it in the environment or a local `.env` file, and never place it inline in commands, chats, or packaged files.
- The token is scoped to read medical public details only and cannot access private user records.
- The skill does not intentionally persist request parameters locally. Any server-side retention is determined by the NoahAI API service and its operational logging policies.
- It does not request persistent or system-level privileges and does not modify system configuration.
- The skill is source-file based (Python scripts only) and does not require runtime installs, package downloads, or external bootstrap steps.
