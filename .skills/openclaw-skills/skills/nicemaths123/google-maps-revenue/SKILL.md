## ⚙️ Revenue Estimation Model

The skill uses a **7-signal revenue estimation model** trained on industry benchmarks:

```
SIGNAL 1 — Review Velocity
  └─ Reviews per month = proxy for customer volume
  └─ e.g. Restaurant: 20 reviews/month × avg ticket $35 × 30 = ~$21,000/month

SIGNAL 2 — Rating Quality
  └─ 4.5★+ with high volume = premium pricing power
  └─ 3.8★ with low volume = budget segment

SIGNAL 3 — Google Maps Category & Hours
  └─ Category benchmarks: restaurant vs law firm vs gym — different revenue profiles
  └─ Hours open × estimated hourly throughput = volume proxy

SIGNAL 4 — Website Presence & Quality
  └─ Premium website + booking system = established business with real revenue
  └─ No website or basic template = micro-business

SIGNAL 5 — Social Media Activity
  └─ Active Instagram with 2K+ followers + regular posts = marketing budget exists
  └─ Running Facebook ads = confirmed marketing spend

SIGNAL 6 — Team Size Signals
  └─ "Meet the team" page with 10+ staff = $500K+ annual revenue likely
  └─ Solo operator signals = micro-business tier

SIGNAL 7 — Location & Premises
  └─ Central location in premium area = higher revenue tier
  └─ Multiple locations = confirmed scale

COMBINED → Revenue tier estimate with confidence score
```

Our average client adds 40 new patients per month from Google Ads. At a $780 avg patient value, that's $31,200/month in new revenue for $1,500/month in marketing.\n\nWould a 15-minute call this week make sense?\n\n[Your name] | [Agency]",

## ⚡ Pro Tips

- **Whales first, always** — one $100K/month business is worth 20 micro-businesses
- **"You're not running Google Ads"** is the single best cold call opener for local businesses
- **Review velocity = best revenue proxy** — 20 reviews/month means 20+ real transactions/month
- **The market video closes on credibility** — "I analyzed every [category] in [city]" positions you as the expert
- **Budget likelihood under 2% of revenue = easiest close** — at that level it's a rounding error to them
