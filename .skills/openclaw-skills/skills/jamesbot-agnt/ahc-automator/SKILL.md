# AHC-Automator: Alan Harper Composites Workflow Automation

Custom automation suite specifically designed for Alan Harper Composites manufacturing workflows, integrating ClickUp project management, Pipedrive CRM, and client communication systems.

## Overview

The AHC-Automator skill provides three core automation workflows:

1. **Email → ClickUp → Pipedrive Chain**: Automated workflow from email monitoring to task creation and deal management
2. **Client Onboarding Workflow**: Structured onboarding process with templates and automated setups
3. **Project Completion Sequence**: End-to-end project closure with reporting and invoicing triggers

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- ClickUp Team ID: `90132745943`
- Pipedrive API access configured
- WhatsApp integration for notifications
- Email monitoring active (Ian/Ronaldo)

### Run Workflows

```bash
# Email → ClickUp → Pipedrive Chain
python scripts/email_to_clickup_pipedrive.py

# Client Onboarding
python scripts/client_onboarding.py --client "Cliente Novo" --email "cliente@empresa.com"

# Project Completion
python scripts/project_completion.py --project-id 123456
```

---

## Workflow 1: Email → ClickUp → Pipedrive Chain

Monitors specific emails from Ian/Ronaldo and automatically creates tasks in ClickUp and deals in Pipedrive.

### How It Works

```
📧 Email received from Ian/Ronaldo
   ↓
🔍 Parse email content for keywords
   ↓
✅ Create ClickUp task with structured data
   ↓
💼 Create/update Pipedrive deal
   ↓
📱 Send WhatsApp notification
```

### Keywords Monitored

**ClickUp Keywords:**
- "adicionar tarefa", "atualizar ClickUp", "nova tarefa"
- "lista de convidados", "clickup"

**Pipedrive Keywords:**
- "criar deal", "add deal", "nova oportunidade"
- "pipedrive", "adicionar contato", "create lead"
- "update pipeline", "add person", "nova atividade"

### Configuration

Email monitoring is handled by existing cron jobs:
- **Ian**: `ian@alanharpercomposites.com.br` (Every 5 minutes)
- **Ronaldo**: `ronaldoaibot@gmail.com` (Every 5 minutes)

### Custom Implementation

```python
# Example usage in scripts/email_to_clickup_pipedrive.py
from ahc_automator import EmailProcessor, ClickUpClient, PipedriveClient

processor = EmailProcessor()
email_data = processor.parse_latest_emails(['ian@alanharpercomposites.com.br'])

for email in email_data:
    if processor.contains_keywords(email, 'clickup'):
        clickup = ClickUpClient()
        task_result = clickup.create_task_from_email(email)
        
    if processor.contains_keywords(email, 'pipedrive'):
        pipedrive = PipedriveClient()
        deal_result = pipedrive.create_deal_from_email(email)
```

---

## Workflow 2: Client Onboarding Workflow

Automated client onboarding process that creates structured projects, folders, and templates.

### How It Works

```
👤 New client identified
   ↓
📂 Create ClickUp project with structured folders
   ↓
📋 Generate template tasks based on client type
   ↓
📧 Send welcome email sequence
   ↓
📅 Schedule follow-up activities
```
