## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Clear Task Description

✅ **Good**: "Design microservices architecture: including module division, technology selection, deployment plan, monitoring system"
❌ **Bad**: "Do an architecture"

### 2. Provide Sufficient Context

✅ **Good**: 
```
Based on architecture design document v2.0, using SQLite for rule storage,
need to support 100,000+ rules, query latency < 10ms
```

❌ **Bad**: "Implement based on document"

### 3. Reasonable Use of Consensus

- **Simple tasks** → Single role (fast response)
- **Complex tasks** → Multi-role consensus (comprehensive consideration)
- **Major decisions** → Consensus required (reduce risk)

### 4. Follow Role Output

Each role has standard output format to ensure consistent quality:

- **Architect**: Architecture diagram + module list + interface definition + data model + deployment plan
- **Product Manager**: PRD + user stories + acceptance criteria + competitive analysis
- **Test Expert**: Test strategy + test cases + automation plan + quality report
- **Solo Coder**: Complete code + unit tests + technical documentation

### 5. Timely Feedback and Adjustment

If unsatisfied with role output:
1. Clearly state the problem
2. Provide specific improvement suggestions
3. Request multi-role consensus if necessary
