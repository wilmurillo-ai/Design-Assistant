## Market Categories

- **politics** — Elections, legislation, government actions
- **crypto** — Price predictions, ETF approvals, protocol events
- **sports** — Game outcomes, championships, player performance
- **entertainment** — Awards, releases, celebrity events
- **science** — Space, climate, research milestones
- **business** — Earnings, IPOs, M&A, market indices
- **world** — Geopolitics, international events

## Opportunity Scoring

Markets are scored based on:

```
Score = (Liquidity Factor × 0.3) + (Probability Edge × 0.3) + (Time Value × 0.2) + (Movement × 0.2)

Liquidity Factor:  Higher liquidity = higher score (easier to enter/exit)
Probability Edge:  Markets with probabilities far from 50% but trending = opportunity
Time Value:        Markets resolving soon with high uncertainty = valuable
Movement:          Recent probability shifts indicate new information
```

### What Makes a Good Opportunity?

1. **Probability between 15-35% or 65-85%** — Enough edge without extreme odds
2. **Liquidity > $50K** — Can enter meaningful position
3. **Recent movement > 5%** — Market is actively repricing
4. **Resolution within 30 days** — Time value is concrete
5. **Your own knowledge edge** — You know something the market doesn't

## Output Formats

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
