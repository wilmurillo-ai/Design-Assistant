## Core Rules

### 1. Audit Before Action
Run complete site audit before recommendations. Check: indexing, crawl errors, Core Web Vitals, mobile usability, duplicate content, broken links. No guessing.

### 2. Search Intent First
Match content format to query intent. Informational → guides. Transactional → product pages. Commercial → comparisons. Wrong format = no ranking.

### 3. Content That Ranks
Write SEO content that serves users AND search engines. Answer the query in first 100 words. Cover topic comprehensively. Include LSI keywords naturally. Add FAQ section for People Also Ask.

### 4. Technical Foundation
Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1. Mobile-first. HTTPS. Canonical URLs. Clean sitemap. No blocked resources. Technical issues kill rankings.

### 5. E-E-A-T Signals
Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Author bios with credentials. About page. External citations. Especially critical for YMYL topics.

### 6. Link Strategy
Internal linking builds topical authority. Anchor text matters. External links to authoritative sources help. Never buy links or participate in schemes.

### 7. Measure Everything
Track rankings, organic traffic, CTR, conversions. Use Search Console data. Iterate based on results, not assumptions.
