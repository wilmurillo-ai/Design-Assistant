# Designing with Sleek

[![Design mobile apps in minutes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleekdotdesign/agent-skills/main/assets/hero.png)](https://sleek.design)

## Overview

[sleek.design](https://sleek.design) is an AI-powered mobile app design tool. You interact with it via a REST API at `/api/v1/*` to create projects, describe what you want built in plain language, and get back rendered screens. All communication is standard HTTP with bearer token auth.

**Base URL**: `https://sleek.design`
**Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer $SLEEK_API_KEY` on every `/api/v1/*` request
**Content-Type**: `application/json` (requests and responses)
**CORS**: Enabled on all `/api/v1/*` endpoints

---

## Prerequisites: API Key

Create API keys at **https://sleek.design/dashboard/api-keys**. The full key value is shown only once at creation — store it in the `SLEEK_API_KEY` environment variable.

**Required plan**: Pro+ (API access is gated)

### Key scopes

| Scope             | What it unlocks              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `projects:read`   | List / get projects          |
| `projects:write`  | Create / delete projects     |
| `components:read` | List components in a project |
| `chats:read`      | Get chat run status          |
| `chats:write`     | Send chat messages           |
| `screenshots`     | Render component screenshots |

Create a key with only the scopes needed for the task.

---

## Security & Privacy

- **Single host**: All requests go exclusively to `https://sleek.design`. No data is sent to third parties.
- **HTTPS only**: All communication uses HTTPS. The API key is transmitted only in the `Authorization` header to Sleek endpoints.
- **Minimal scopes**: Create API keys with only the scopes required for the task. Prefer short-lived or revocable keys.
- **Image URLs**: When using `imageUrls` in chat messages, those URLs are fetched by Sleek's servers. Avoid passing URLs that contain sensitive content.

---

## Handling high-level requests

When the user says something like "design a fitness tracking app" or "build me a settings screen":

1. **Create a project** if one doesn't exist yet (ask the user for a name, or derive one from the request)
2. **Send a chat message** describing what to build — you can use the user's words directly as `message.text`; Sleek's AI interprets natural language
3. **Follow the screenshot delivery rule** below to show the result

You do not need to decompose the request into screens first. Send the full intent as a single message and let Sleek decide what screens to create.

---

## Screenshot delivery rule

**After every chat run that produces `screen_created` or `screen_updated` operations, always take screenshots and show them to the user.** Never silently complete a chat run without delivering the visuals.

**When screens are created for the first time on a project** (i.e. the run includes `screen_created` operations), deliver:
1. One screenshot per newly created screen (individual `componentIds: [screenId]`)
2. One combined screenshot of all screens in the project (`componentIds: [all screen ids]`)

**When only existing screens are updated**, deliver one screenshot per affected screen.

Use `background: "transparent"` for all screenshots unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "total": 5, "limit": 50, "offset": 0 }
}
```

---

### Chat — Send Message

This is the core action: describe what you want in `message.text` and the AI creates or modifies screens.

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/chat/messages?wait=false
Authorization: Bearer $SLEEK_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
idempotency-key: <optional, max 255 chars>

{
  "message": { "text": "Add a pricing section with three tiers" },
  "imageUrls": ["https://example.com/ref.png"],
  "target": { "screenId": "scr_abc" }
}
```

| Field                    | Required | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `message.text`           | Yes      | 1+ chars, trimmed                             |
| `imageUrls`              | No       | HTTPS URLs only; included as visual context   |
| `target.screenId`        | No       | Edit a specific screen; omit to let AI decide |
| `?wait=true/false`       | No       | Sync wait mode (default: false)               |
| `idempotency-key` header | No       | Replay-safe re-sends                          |

#### Response — async (default, `wait=false`)

Status `202 Accepted`. `result` and `error` are absent until the run reaches a terminal state.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "runId": "run_111",
    "status": "queued",
    "statusUrl": "/api/v1/projects/proj_abc/chat/runs/run_111"
  }
}
```

#### Response — sync (`wait=true`)

Blocks up to **300 seconds**. Returns `200` when completed, `202` if timed out.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "runId": "run_111",
    "status": "completed",
    "statusUrl": "...",
    "result": {
      "assistantText": "I added a pricing section with...",
      "operations": [
        { "type": "screen_created", "screenId": "scr_xyz", "screenName": "Pricing" },
        { "type": "screen_updated", "screenId": "scr_abc" },
        { "type": "theme_updated" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Chat — Poll Run Status

Use this after async send to check progress.

```http
GET /api/v1/projects/:projectId/chat/runs/:runId
Authorization: Bearer $SLEEK_API_KEY
```

Response — same shape as send message `data` object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "runId": "run_111",
    "status": "queued",
    "statusUrl": "..."
  }
}
```

When completed successfully, `result` is present:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "runId": "run_111",
    "status": "completed",
    "statusUrl": "...",
    "result": {
      "assistantText": "...",
      "operations": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

When failed, `error` is present:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "runId": "run_111",
    "status": "failed",
    "statusUrl": "...",
    "error": { "code": "execution_failed", "message": "..." }
  }
}
```

**Run status lifecycle**: `queued` → `running` → `completed | failed`

---

### Screenshots

Takes a snapshot of one or more rendered components.

```http
POST /api/v1/screenshots
Authorization: Bearer $SLEEK_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "componentIds": ["cmp_xyz", "cmp_abc"],
  "projectId": "proj_abc",
  "format": "png",
  "scale": 2,
  "gap": 40,
  "padding": 40,
  "background": "transparent"
}
```

| Field        | Default       | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format`     | `png`         | `png` or `webp`                                                      |
| `scale`      | `2`           | 1–3 (device pixel ratio)                                             |
| `gap`        | `40`          | Pixels between components                                            |
| `padding`       | `40`          | Uniform padding on all sides                                         |
| `paddingX`      | _(optional)_  | Horizontal padding; overrides `padding` for left/right when provided |
| `paddingY`      | _(optional)_  | Vertical padding; overrides `padding` for top/bottom when provided   |
| `paddingTop`    | _(optional)_  | Top padding; overrides `paddingY` when provided                      |
| `paddingRight`  | _(optional)_  | Right padding; overrides `paddingX` when provided                    |
| `paddingBottom` | _(optional)_  | Bottom padding; overrides `paddingY` when provided                   |
| `paddingLeft`   | _(optional)_  | Left padding; overrides `paddingX` when provided                     |
| `background`    | `transparent` | Any CSS color (hex, named, `transparent`)                            |
| `showDots`      | `false`       | Overlay a subtle dot grid on the background                          |

Padding resolves with a cascade: per-side → axis → uniform. For example, `paddingTop` falls back to `paddingY`, which falls back to `padding`. So `{ "padding": 20, "paddingX": 10, "paddingLeft": 5 }` gives top/bottom 20px, right 10px, left 5px.

When `showDots` is `true`, a dot pattern is drawn over the background color. The dots automatically adapt to the background: dark backgrounds get light dots, light backgrounds get dark dots. This has no effect when `background` is `"transparent"`.

Always use `"background": "transparent"` unless the user explicitly requests a specific background color.

Response: raw binary `image/png` or `image/webp` with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.

## Flows

### Flow 1: Create project and generate a UI (async + polling)

```
1. POST /api/v1/projects                              → get projectId
2. POST /api/v1/projects/:id/chat/messages            → get runId (202)
3. Poll GET /api/v1/projects/:id/chat/runs/:runId
   until status == "completed" or "failed"
4. Collect screenIds from result.operations
   (screen_created and screen_updated entries)
5. Screenshot each affected screen individually
6. If any screen_created: also screenshot all project screens combined
7. Show all screenshots to the user
```

**Polling recommendation**: start at 2s interval, back off to 5s after 10s, give up after 5 minutes.

### Flow 2: Sync mode (simple, blocking)

Best for short tasks or when latency is acceptable.

```
1. POST /api/v1/projects/:id/chat/messages?wait=true
   → blocks up to 300s
   → 200 if completed, 202 if timed out
2. If 202, fall back to Flow 1 polling with the returned runId
3. On completion, screenshot and show affected screens (see screenshot delivery rule)
```

### Flow 3: Edit a specific screen

```
1. GET /api/v1/projects/:id/components         → find screenId
2. POST /api/v1/projects/:id/chat/messages
   body: { message: { text: "..." }, target: { screenId: "scr_xyz" } }
3. Poll or wait as above
4. Screenshot the updated screen and show it to the user
```

### Flow 4: Idempotent message (safe retries)

Add `idempotency-key` header on the send request. If the network drops and you retry with the same key, the server returns the existing run rather than creating a duplicate. The key must be ≤255 chars.

```
POST /api/v1/projects/:id/chat/messages
idempotency-key: my-unique-request-id-abc123
```

### Flow 5: One run at a time (conflict handling)

Only one active run is allowed per project. If you send a message while one is running, you get `409 CONFLICT`. Wait for the active run to complete before sending the next message.

```
409 response → poll existing run → completed → send next message
```

---

## Pagination

All list endpoints accept `limit` (1–100, default 50) and `offset` (≥0). The response always includes `pagination.total` so you can page through all results.

```http
GET /api/v1/projects?limit=10&offset=20
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                             | Fix                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sending to `/api/v1` without `Authorization` header | Add `Authorization: Bearer $SLEEK_API_KEY` to every request                              |
| Using wrong scope                                   | Check key's scopes match the endpoint (e.g. `chats:write` for sending messages) |
| Sending next message before run completes           | Poll until `completed`/`failed` before next send                                |
| Using `wait=true` on long generations               | It blocks 300s max; have a fallback to polling for `202` response               |
| HTTP URLs in `imageUrls`                            | Only HTTPS URLs are accepted                                                    |
| Assuming `result` is present on `202`               | `result` is absent until status is `completed`                                  |
