# Evolutionary Model

> *An AI agent that doesn't learn is just an expensive chatbot.*

## The Core Idea

Most people set up AI assistants once and use them forever the same way. The Evolutionary Model is different: the agent grows smarter with every session, accumulates skills, and becomes increasingly specific to its owner's needs.

The model has three axes of evolution:

```
Memory      → agent remembers decisions, context, preferences
Skills      → agent gains new capabilities over time  
Protocols   → agent behavior becomes more reliable and predictable
```

---

## Architecture

### Layer 0 — Identity
Who the agent is. Fixed at birth, rarely changed.

```
SOUL.md       — personality, values, operating principles
IDENTITY.md   — name, role, emoji, avatar
USER.md       — who the agent serves (name, timezone, preferences)
```

### Layer 1 — Memory
How the agent persists across sessions.

```
memory/SESSION-STATE.md      — current focus (WAL, read first)
memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md         — daily raw log
MEMORY.md                    — curated long-term memory
memory/chat-log-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl  — conversation history
```

**Key principle:** no mental notes. If it's not written to a file, it doesn't exist after session restart.

### Layer 2 — Skills
What the agent can do. Each skill is a self-contained capability module.

```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md        — instructions + when_to_use frontmatter
    scripts/        — executable helpers (bash, python)
    config.json     — user-configurable parameters
    README.md       — human-readable docs
```

**`when_to_use` is critical.** Without it, the agent doesn't know when to activate the skill. Format:
```yaml
---
when_to_use: "Use when user asks for X, Y, or Z."
---
```

### Layer 3 — Protocols
How the agent behaves reliably. Learned from mistakes.

```
AGENTS.md     — operating rules, safety, memory protocol
HEARTBEAT.md  — periodic check-in schedule and format
policy.yaml   — what agent can do without asking (allow/ask/deny)
```

---

## How Evolution Works

### Session → Memory
Every session, the agent:
1. Reads `SESSION-STATE.md` (hot context)
2. Reads today's daily log
3. Works
4. Writes new decisions/insights to daily log
5. Periodically distills into `MEMORY.md`

### Task → Skill
When the agent solves a new type of problem:
1. Documents the solution
2. Creates `skills/task-name/SKILL.md`
3. Adds `when_to_use` so it auto-activates next time

### Mistake → Protocol
When the agent makes a mistake:
1. Analyzes root cause
2. Adds rule to `AGENTS.md` or `SOUL.md`
3. Future sessions inherit the fix

## Skill Quality Standards

A skill is production-ready when it has:

- [ ] `when_to_use` frontmatter — agent knows when to use it
- [ ] `description` frontmatter — discoverable in skill catalogs
- [ ] No hardcoded personal context (paths, names, tokens)
- [ ] `config.json` or env vars for user-specific settings
- [ ] `README.md` explaining what it does and how to configure
- [ ] Scripts that work from any machine (no absolute paths)

## Starter Kit

Minimum viable agent setup:

```
clawd/
  SOUL.md           — who you are
  IDENTITY.md       — your name
  USER.md           — who you serve
  AGENTS.md         — operating rules
  MEMORY.md         — start empty
  memory/           — create on first run
  skills/           — add as you grow
```

Bootstrap checklist:
1. Fill `USER.md` with owner's name, timezone, communication style
2. Write `SOUL.md` — personality takes 30 minutes, saves 1000 future corrections
3. Pick 3 starter skills from the catalog
4. Run first session — agent reads all files and introduces itself
5. After session: review what the agent wrote to memory files

## The Compounding Effect

Month 1: agent knows your name and timezone  
Month 2: agent knows your projects, communication style, key contacts  
Month 3: agent anticipates needs, runs proactive checks, catches mistakes  
Month 6: agent has accumulated skills specific to your workflow  
Month 12: agent is irreplaceable — it carries institutional knowledge no new model can replicate

This is why the model is called "evolutionary": the value grows non-linearly. Not because the base model gets smarter, but because the accumulated context, skills, and protocols become a moat.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

| | ChatGPT / Standard Assistant | Evolutionary Model |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | Resets every session | Persists across sessions |
| Skills | Fixed capabilities | Grows with use |
| Context | Generic | Specific to you |
| Mistakes | Repeated | Documented + prevented |
| Value over time | Flat | Compounding |
| Portability | Locked to provider | Files you own |

The Evolutionary Model runs on any AI provider. The intelligence isn't in the model — it's in the accumulated files. You own them.

## Contributing Skills

Skills are just markdown files. To share a skill:

1. Remove all personal context (names, paths, tokens)
2. Replace with `${VARIABLE}` or `config.json` entries
3. Add `when_to_use` frontmatter
4. Write a `README.md`
5. Submit to [ClaWHub](https://clawhub.com) or share as a repo
