# UniFi Network Monitoring Skill

Monitor and query your UniFi network via the local UniFi OS gateway API (tested on Cloud Gateway Ultra).

## Purpose

This skill provides **read-only** access to your UniFi network's operational data:
- Devices (APs, switches, gateway) status and health
- Active clients (who's connected where)
- Network health overview
- Traffic insights (top applications via DPI)
- Recent alarms and events

All operations are **GET-only** and safe for monitoring/reporting.

## Setup

Create the credentials file: `~/.openclaw/credentials/unifi.json`

```json
{
  "host": "your-gateway-ip",
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password",
  "note": "Local Read-Only account on UniFi OS"
}
```

**Note:** The URL must use HTTPS and point to your UniFi gateway. The `site` is usually `default` for home setups.

- `host`: Your UniFi OS gateway IP/hostname (without https://)
- `username`: Local UniFi OS admin username
- `password`: Local UniFi OS admin password
- `site`: Site name (usually `default`)

## Commands

All commands support optional `json` argument for raw JSON output (default is human-readable table).

### Network Dashboard

Comprehensive view of all network stats (Health, Devices, Clients, Networks, DPI, etc.):

```bash
bash scripts/dashboard.sh
bash scripts/dashboard.sh json  # Raw JSON for all sections
```

**Output:** Full ASCII dashboard with all metrics.

### List Devices

Shows all UniFi devices (APs, switches, gateway):

```bash
bash scripts/devices.sh
bash scripts/devices.sh json  # Raw JSON
```

**Output:** Device name, model, IP, state, uptime, connected clients

### List Active Clients

Shows who's currently connected:

```bash
bash scripts/clients.sh
bash scripts/clients.sh json  # Raw JSON
```

**Output:** Hostname, IP, MAC, AP, signal strength, RX/TX rates

### Health Summary

Site-wide health status:

```bash
bash scripts/health.sh
bash scripts/health.sh json  # Raw JSON
```

**Output:** Subsystem status (WAN, LAN, WLAN), counts (up/adopted/disconnected)

### Top Applications (DPI)

Top bandwidth consumers by application:

```bash
bash scripts/top-apps.sh
bash scripts/top-apps.sh 15  # Show top 15 (default: 10)
```

**Output:** App name, category, RX/TX/total traffic in GB

### Recent Alerts

Recent alarms and events:

```bash
bash scripts/alerts.sh
bash scripts/alerts.sh 50  # Show last 50 (default: 20)
```

**Output:** Timestamp, alarm key, message, affected device

## Workflow

When the user asks about UniFi:

1. **"What's on my network?"** → Run `bash scripts/devices.sh` + `bash scripts/clients.sh`
2. **"Is everything healthy?"** → Run `bash scripts/health.sh`
3. **"Any problems?"** → Run `bash scripts/alerts.sh`
4. **"What's using bandwidth?"** → Run `bash scripts/top-apps.sh`
5. **"Show me a dashboard"** or general checkup → Run `bash scripts/dashboard.sh`

Always confirm the output looks reasonable before presenting it to the user (check for auth failures, empty data, etc.).

## Notes

- Requires network access to your UniFi gateway
- Uses UniFi OS login + `/proxy/network` API path
- All calls are **read-only GET requests**
- Tested endpoints are documented in `references/unifi-readonly-endpoints.md`
