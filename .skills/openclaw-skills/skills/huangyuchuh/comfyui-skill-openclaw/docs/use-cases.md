    <p class="eyebrow-label">Use Case 1</p>
    <h2>Turn a local ComfyUI workflow into a callable skill</h2>
    <p>
      The most direct use case is taking a workflow you already exported from ComfyUI,
      wrapping it with <code>schema.json</code>, and letting OpenClaw call it with
      natural-language-derived arguments. This is useful when the workflow logic is stable
      but the prompts or seeds change from request to request.

  <section class="section-card">
    <p class="eyebrow-label">Use Case 2</p>
    <h2>Route jobs across different ComfyUI servers</h2>
    <p>
      Many users have more than one generation target: a local GPU box, a remote workstation,
      or a higher-memory machine for heavier checkpoints. This repository lets you keep those
      workflows under a single skill system with server-level and workflow-level enable switches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a cleaner namespace such as <code>local/sdxl-base</code> and <code>remote-a100/sdxl-base</code>
      without losing the original workflow identity.
    </p>

  <section class="section-card">
    <p class="eyebrow-label">Use Case 3</p>
    <h2>Standardize what the agent is allowed to change</h2>
    <p>
      Raw ComfyUI graphs are powerful but noisy. The schema layer gives you a stable contract:
      which parameters are visible, which are required, which types are expected, and how they map
      into node fields. That makes the repository useful as a safety layer between an LLM and a graph.

    <p class="eyebrow-label">Use Case 4</p>
    <h2>Let an agent manage configuration for you</h2>
    <p>
      Because the project is structured around predictable files and a single CLI tool (<code>comfyui-skill</code>),
      any coding agent can add servers, import workflows, check dependencies, and verify the setup.
      This is especially helpful when moving the same skill pack across machines using <code>config export</code> and <code>config import</code>.
