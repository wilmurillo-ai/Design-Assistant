## Configuration

After running setup, config is saved to `~/.config/gekko-yield/config.json`:

```json
{
  "wallet": {
    "source": "env",
    "envVar": "PRIVATE_KEY"
  },
  "rpc": "https://mainnet.base.org"
}
```

## Security

⚠️ **This skill manages real funds:**

- Private key loaded from environment variable at runtime
- Never logged or written to disk
- All transactions simulated before execution
- Contract addresses verified on each run

**Recommendations:**
- Use a dedicated hot wallet
- Only deposit what you're comfortable with
- Keep ETH for gas on Base

## Rate Limit Handling

The script automatically handles RPC rate limits (429 errors) by:

- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
- **Fallback to alternative RPCs** if the primary endpoint is rate limited
- **Built-in delays** between requests to avoid hitting limits

If you encounter rate limits, the script will automatically:
1. Retry the request with increasing delays
2. Switch to alternative RPC endpoints if needed
3. Show progress messages during retries

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- USDC on Base
- ETH on Base (for gas)

## Dependencies

```bash
cd scripts && pnpm install
```
