## Platform Constraints

- MUST NOT: Never run commands containing hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens. Scan all shell commands for secret patterns before execution.
- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

Chrome extension development has a steep cliff of Manifest V3 gotchas that no other AI coding pack addresses. Service workers terminate silently after 30 seconds of idle, taking all JS-variable state with them. Fifty-eight percent of Chrome Web Store rejections are preventable compliance errors. The new Chrome AI APIs (Gemini Nano, Chrome 138+) require hardware checks, graceful fallbacks, and port-based streaming — none of which are obvious from the docs. This pack groups six tightly-coupled concerns — MV3 scaffolding, message passing, storage, CWS preflight, store listing, and built-in AI — because a gap in any single layer produces a broken, rejected, or battery-draining extension. Activates automatically when `manifest.json` with `manifest_version: 3` or `chrome.*` API usage is detected.

## Triggers

- Auto-trigger: when `manifest.json` containing `"manifest_version": 3` is found in project root or `src/`
- Auto-trigger: when files matching `**/background.ts`, `**/service-worker.ts`, `**/content.ts`, `**/popup.ts` exist alongside a `manifest.json`
- Auto-trigger: when `chrome.*` API calls are found in project source files
- `/rune chrome-ext` — manual invocation
- Called by `cook` (L1) when Chrome extension project context is detected
- Called by `scaffold` (L1) when user requests a new browser extension project

## Connections

```
Calls → sentinel (L2): security audit on permissions, CSP, and storage patterns
Calls → verification (L3): validate TypeScript types, run extension build
Calls → git (L3): semantic commit after scaffold or publish prep
Called By ← cook (L1): when Chrome extension project context detected
Called By ← scaffold (L1): when user requests new browser extension project
Called By ← launch (L1): pre-flight check before CWS submission
Called By ← preflight (L2): runs cws-preflight as part of broader pre-deploy audit
```

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Event listener registered inside `addEventListener('load', ...)` or async IIFE — silently ignored after SW termination | CRITICAL | Grep for `onMessage.addListener` not at module top level; scaffold always generates top-level listeners |
| `setTimeout` keepalive hack breaks on Chrome 119+ — Chrome patched the timeout extension trick | HIGH | Use `chrome.alarms` for periodic work; use `chrome.storage.session` for state; never rely on SW staying alive |
| `sendMessage` returns `undefined` when no listener responds — mistaken for success | HIGH | Check `chrome.runtime.lastError` in callback; use typed response interface that includes `error?: string` |
| Streaming AI returns cumulative text (not delta chunks) — UI duplicates content | HIGH | Slice previous from current: `const delta = chunk.slice(prev.length); prev = chunk` |
| `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` throws when content script not yet injected or tab is restricted | HIGH | Wrap in try/catch; check `sender.tab` exists; use `executeScript` to inject first if needed |
| Extension passes local testing but fails CWS review for `eval()` in bundled node_modules | CRITICAL | Run `grep -r "eval(" node_modules/` before submission; replace or patch offending dependency |

## Done When

- `manifest.json` has no declared permissions absent from source code (verified by Grep)
- Service worker registers all listeners synchronously at module top level — no listener inside async function
- `chrome.storage` is used for all state — no JS variables relied upon to survive termination
- No `eval()`, `Function()`, remote `<script>` tags, or external `import()` in any source or bundled file
- `cws-preflight` report shows no FAIL items and WARN items are reviewed
- `chrome.aiLanguageModel.capabilities()` is checked before use and graceful fallback is implemented
- Streaming AI uses port-based messaging and correctly extracts deltas from cumulative chunks
- Store listing copy is under character limits, permission justifications are written in plain English
- Extension loads in Chrome via `chrome://extensions → Load unpacked` without errors

## Cost Profile

~1,500–3,000 tokens per skill activation. `haiku` for file scans (Grep, Glob, manifest reading); `sonnet` for scaffold generation, storage schema, and message type definitions; `sonnet` for cws-preflight audit and store listing copy; `sonnet` for AI integration wiring. Full pack activation (all 6 skills) runs ~12,000–18,000 tokens end-to-end. `cws-preflight` is the heaviest single skill (~3,000 tokens) due to multi-pass scanning.

# cws-preflight

Chrome Web Store compliance audit — scan for over-permissioning, remote code execution, CSP violations, missing assets, and generate permission justification text. The highest-value skill in this pack: 58% of CWS rejections are preventable compliance errors caught here before submission.

**Top 5 CWS rejection reasons (2024 data):**
1. Over-permissioning — requesting permissions not demonstrably used in submitted code
2. Remote code execution — `eval()`, `Function()` constructor, CDN `<script>` tags, `import()` from external URLs
3. Misleading description — functionality not matching store listing claims
4. Missing or inaccessible privacy policy — required for any extension that handles user data
5. Branding violations — trademarked names (Google, Chrome, YouTube) in extension name or icon

**Triggers for manual review (3+ weeks instead of 24-72h):**
- Broad `host_permissions` with `<all_urls>` or `https://*/*`
- Sensitive permission combinations: `tabs` + `history` + `cookies`
- New developer account submitting extension with sensitive permissions
- Relaxed `content_security_policy` (`unsafe-eval`, `unsafe-inline`)
- First submission of a new extension (always manual)

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — Lint manifest for over-permissioning**
Use read_file on `manifest.json`. For each declared permission, verify it is actually used in source code with grep. Flag any permission declared but not found in `*.ts` / `*.js` source files. Severity: HIGH.

Common over-permissioning patterns to flag:
- `"tabs"` declared when only `activeTab` is needed (activeTab is granted on user click, requires no declaration)
- `"history"` declared without `chrome.history.*` usage
- `"bookmarks"` declared without `chrome.bookmarks.*` usage
- `"<all_urls>"` in `host_permissions` when specific domains suffice
- `"cookies"` declared without `chrome.cookies.*` usage

**Step 2 — Scan for remote code execution**
Grep to find patterns that trigger automatic CWS rejection:

```
pattern: "eval\s*\(" → remote code execution
pattern: "new Function\s*\(" → remote code execution
pattern: "<script[^>]+src=['\"]https?://" → remote script loading in HTML files
pattern: "import\s*\(['\"]https?://" → dynamic import from external URL
```

Flag each result as CRITICAL — these cause automatic rejection with no appeal path.

**Step 3 — Validate Content Security Policy**
Read the `content_security_policy.extension_pages` value from `manifest.json`. Flag any of:
- `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` — allows eval, triggers rejection
- `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src` — allows inline scripts, triggers rejection
- External domains in `script-src` (anything not `'self'`) — remote code execution risk
- Missing CSP entirely — defaults to `script-src 'self'` which is fine, but document it

**Step 4 — Verify privacy policy**
Check if the extension collects user data (network requests to external servers, `chrome.storage` usage, content script reading page content). If yes:
- Privacy policy URL must be set in CWS Developer Dashboard
- Privacy policy must be publicly accessible (verify URL is live)
- Generate a minimal privacy policy template if none exists

**Step 5 — Check required assets**
Verify the following exist at declared paths in `manifest.json`:
- Icon at 128×128px (required for store listing)
- Screenshots: at least 1, dimensions 1280×800 or 640×400 (PNG or JPEG)
- Promotional tile: 440×280px (optional but strongly recommended)
- All declared icons (16, 32, 48, 128px) present at referenced paths

Glob to verify file existence. Run_command to check image dimensions with `file` or `identify` if ImageMagick is available.

**Step 6 — Generate permission justification text**
For each declared permission, generate CWS-ready justification text. The CWS dashboard requires one justification per permission. Justifications must be specific — "We need this to work" is rejected.

**Step 7 — Produce preflight report**
Write `.rune/chrome-ext/preflight-report.md` with:
- PASS / WARN / FAIL per check
- Specific file + line for each issue
- Fix instructions
- Estimated review timeline (fast-track vs manual review triggers)
- Submission checklist

#### Example

```markdown
<!-- .rune/chrome-ext/preflight-report.md (generated by cws-preflight) -->

# CWS Preflight Report — Page Summarizer v1.0.0
Generated: 2026-03-12

## Summary
| Check | Status | Issues |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Permissions audit | ⚠️ WARN | 1 over-permission |
| Remote code execution | ✅ PASS | None found |
| Content Security Policy | ✅ PASS | Correct default |
| Privacy policy | ⚠️ WARN | URL not set in manifest |
| Required assets | ✅ PASS | All present |
| Permission justifications | ✅ READY | Generated below |

## Issues

### WARN: Over-permission — `"tabs"` not required
**File**: manifest.json line 7
**Detail**: `"tabs"` permission is declared but no `chrome.tabs.*` API calls found in source.
The extension uses `activeTab` (implicit on action click) — remove `"tabs"` from permissions array.
**Fix**: Remove `"tabs"` from `"permissions"` array.

### WARN: Privacy policy URL missing
**Detail**: Extension reads page content via content script (content.ts:L12 — `document.body.innerText`).
This constitutes user data handling and requires a privacy policy URL in the CWS Developer Dashboard.
**Fix**: Add privacy policy URL at publish time. Template: `.rune/chrome-ext/privacy-policy-template.md`

## Permission Justifications (paste into CWS dashboard)

### activeTab
"The extension reads the content of the current active tab when the user clicks the toolbar button
to initiate a summarization. No data is collected without explicit user action."

### storage
"The extension stores user settings (AI preference, API key, summary length) locally to persist
preferences between browser sessions. No data is synced externally."

### sidePanel
"The extension uses the Side Panel API to display AI-generated summaries in a persistent panel
without obscuring the page content."

## Estimated Review Timeline
- No sensitive permissions detected
- No broad host_permissions
- Timeline: **24–72 hours** (standard review)
- Recommendation: submit Tuesday–Thursday for fastest turnaround

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] Remove `"tabs"` from permissions array
- [ ] Add privacy policy URL to CWS Developer Dashboard
- [ ] Upload 1280×800 screenshot showing extension in use
- [ ] Write store description (min 132 chars for detailed description)
- [ ] Set category: Productivity
- [ ] Set language: English
- [ ] $5 one-time developer registration fee paid
```

# cws-publish

Chrome Web Store listing preparation and submission guide — store listing copy, screenshot descriptions, permission justifications, visibility settings, and timeline expectations. Produces a ready-to-paste store listing document.

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — Verify preflight passed**
Check for `.rune/chrome-ext/preflight-report.md`. If it does not exist or contains FAIL items, halt and direct user to run `cws-preflight` first. WARN items should be reviewed and resolved before submission.

**Step 2 — Prepare store listing copy**
Generate CWS listing text following Google's constraints:
- **Name**: max 45 characters. Must not include trademarked names (Google, Chrome, YouTube, Gmail). Cannot include "Extension" (Chrome adds it automatically).
- **Short description**: max 132 characters. First thing users see in search results — front-load the value proposition.
- **Detailed description**: no hard limit but 400–800 words is optimal. Structure: opening hook (1 sentence) → feature bullets (5-7) → how it works (2-3 sentences) → privacy statement (1-2 sentences).
- Avoid keyword stuffing — Google's policy considers it spam.

**Step 3 — Generate screenshot descriptions**
CWS screenshots need captions (optional but recommended). Generate 3-5 screenshot scenarios showing distinct use cases. Each screenshot should be 1280×800 or 640×400 pixels, PNG or JPEG, <2MB.

**Step 4 — Fill permission justifications**
Pull from `cws-preflight` output. Each permission needs a one-paragraph justification in plain English. Write from the user's perspective: "This permission allows the extension to..." not "We need this to...".

**Step 5 — Choose visibility and distribution**
| Visibility | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| Public | Visible in CWS search — default for most extensions |
| Unlisted | Direct URL only — good for beta testing with known users |
| Private | Team-only — enterprise internal tools |

Select distribution regions (default: all). Consider unlisted for v1.0 while gathering initial feedback, then switch to public after first positive reviews.

**Step 6 — Generate submission guide with timeline**
Emit `.rune/chrome-ext/store-listing.md` with all copy ready to paste. Include submission steps and timeline expectations.

**Timeline expectations:**
- Simple extension, experienced developer account, no sensitive permissions: **24–72 hours**
- Sensitive permissions (`tabs`, `history`, `cookies`, `management`): **3–7 business days**
- Broad `host_permissions` or first submission: **up to 3 weeks** (manual review queue)
- Rejection: **10-day resubmission window** after fixing issues; same review time applies

**Submission tips:**
- Never submit on Friday — reviewers are less available Mon-Tue; submit Tue-Thu
- Use `optional_permissions` for non-critical features — reduces barrier to install and CWS scrutiny
- `optional_host_permissions` can be requested at runtime, reducing declared permissions
- Version bump required for each resubmission after rejection
- Include a test account in submission notes if extension requires authentication

# CWS Store Listing — Page Summarizer

## Name (max 45 chars)
Page Summarizer — AI-Powered Summaries
(38 chars ✅)

## Short Description (max 132 chars)
Summarize any webpage instantly with built-in Chrome AI. One click, no account required, no data sent externally.
(113 chars ✅)

## Detailed Description
Tired of spending 10 minutes reading a page to find out it wasn't worth your time?

**Page Summarizer** gives you the core ideas of any webpage in seconds — powered by Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model, which runs entirely on your device.

**Features:**
- One-click summarization — click the toolbar button or select text to summarize a section
- Built-in AI — no API key required, no data leaves your device (requires Chrome 138+ with AI hardware support)
- External API fallback — configure your own OpenAI or Anthropic key for older hardware
- Summary length control — short (100 words), medium (300 words), or detailed (500 words)
- Side panel view — summaries appear in a non-intrusive panel alongside the page
- Dark mode support

**How it works:**
Click the toolbar button on any page. The extension reads the visible text and generates a summary using the on-device Gemini Nano model. If your hardware does not support built-in AI, the extension falls back to an external API of your choice (optional — extension still works without it in built-in AI mode).

**Privacy:**
No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted without your action. Summaries generated via the built-in AI model never leave your device. External API calls (if configured) are made directly to the API provider — not through any intermediary server.

## Screenshots (1280x800px)

1. **Main Use** — Extension sidebar showing a 3-paragraph summary of a news article beside the original page.
2. **Settings** — Settings panel showing AI model selector, API key field, and length preference.
3. **Text Selection** — Right-click context menu on selected text showing "Summarize selection" option.

## Category
Productivity

## Language
English

## Submission Notes (visible to reviewers, not users)
Test the extension on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence — click the toolbar button to summarize. The extension requires Chrome 138+ for built-in AI. On older Chrome versions, configure an external API key in Settings to test the fallback path.
```

# ext-ai-integration

Chrome built-in AI and external API integration — detect AI type, check hardware requirements, implement Gemini Nano with graceful fallback, wire streaming responses via ports, handle rate limits, and test offline behavior. The differentiating skill for next-generation extensions.

**Chrome AI APIs (Chrome 138+ stable):**
| API | Namespace | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Prompt API | `chrome.aiLanguageModel` | General text generation, Q&A, classification |
| Summarizer | `chrome.aiSummarizer` | Condense long text |
| Writer | `chrome.aiWriter` | Generate new content from prompts |
| Rewriter | `chrome.aiRewriter` | Transform existing text (tone, length, format) |
| Translator | `chrome.aiTranslator` | Language translation |
| Language Detector | `chrome.aiLanguageDetector` | Detect text language |

**Hardware requirements for Gemini Nano:**
- Storage: 22 GB free disk space (model download)
- RAM: 4 GB VRAM (dedicated GPU) OR 16 GB system RAM (CPU inference)
- OS: macOS 13+, Windows 10/11 64-bit, ChromeOS (no Linux support)
- Cannot be checked programmatically — use capability API and handle `NotSupportedError`

**Manifest permission:**
```json
{ "permissions": ["aiLanguageModelParams"] }
```

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — Detect AI integration type**
Use read_file on existing source and `manifest.json` to determine:
- Does `"aiLanguageModelParams"` appear in permissions? → Built-in Nano intended
- Does code reference `openai`, `anthropic`, `fetch` to an external AI endpoint? → External API
- Neither? → Need to design integration from scratch

Ask the user: "Do you want to use Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano (no API cost, runs on device, requires Chrome 138+ and compatible hardware), an external API (OpenAI/Anthropic, requires API key and network), or both with automatic fallback?"

**Step 2 — Check hardware capability for Nano**
`chrome.aiLanguageModel.capabilities()` returns `{ available: 'readily' | 'after-download' | 'no' }`. Map these:
- `'readily'` → model is downloaded, use immediately
- `'after-download'` → model needs download (~2GB), show progress UI and wait
- `'no'` → hardware not supported, fall through to fallback

This check MUST happen in the service worker (not content script — restricted APIs). Cache the result in `chrome.storage.session` to avoid repeated capability checks.

**Step 3 — Implement with graceful fallback chain**
Fallback chain: Gemini Nano → External API → Static response

Each tier is a distinct function with the same signature. The orchestrator tries each in order, catching `NotSupportedError`, network errors, and quota errors.

**Step 4 — Wire streaming responses via port messaging**
AI streaming MUST use ports — not `sendMessage`. `sendMessage` is one-shot: the response is sent once and the channel closes. Streaming requires a port to send multiple `CHUNK` messages followed by a `DONE` message.

See `ext-messaging` skill for port setup. Streaming pattern:
1. Sidebar/popup opens a port named `'ai-stream'`
2. Sends `{ text: inputText }` to start generation
3. Service worker receives, calls `session.promptStreaming()`
4. For each chunk in the async iterator, posts `{ type: 'CHUNK', content: chunk }` back on the port
5. On completion, posts `{ type: 'DONE' }` and calls `session.destroy()`

**Step 5 — Handle rate limits and quota**
Chrome built-in AI has per-session token limits. External APIs have rate limits and cost.
- Per session: call `session.destroy()` after each summary to free context window
- External API: implement exponential backoff on 429 responses (1s, 2s, 4s, cap 30s)
- User-facing: show token usage in settings panel if using external API

**Step 6 — Test offline behavior**
Extensions may run without network. Test:
- Built-in Nano: works offline (on-device model)
- External API: fails offline — catch `TypeError: Failed to fetch` and show "No network connection" message
- Storage: `chrome.storage.local` works offline
- Service worker: registers and responds to messages offline

#### Example

```typescript
// src/lib/ai.ts — AI integration with graceful fallback
import { storageGet } from './storage';

export interface AiSummaryResult {
  summary: string;
  source: 'builtin' | 'external' | 'error';
  error?: string;

    }

    const data = await response.json() as {
      choices: Array<{ message: { content: string } }>;
    };
    return data.choices[0]?.message.content ?? '';
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

# ext-messaging

Typed message passing between popup, service worker, and content script — discriminated union message types, one-shot `sendMessage`, long-lived port connections for streaming, and Chrome 146+ error handling. Prevents the #2 MV3 failure: untyped `any` messages, missing `return true` for async handlers, and ports used for single messages.

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — Identify message flows**
Grep to find existing `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`, `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`, and `chrome.runtime.connect` calls. Map the full message topology:
- popup → service worker (sendMessage — one-shot)
- service worker → content script (chrome.tabs.sendMessage — requires tab ID)
- content script → service worker (sendMessage — one-shot)
- service worker → popup (port — only if popup is open)
- streaming AI responses → use Port (not sendMessage — ports survive multiple sends)

**Step 2 — Define TypeScript message types**
Create `src/types/messages.ts` with a discriminated union covering all message directions. Each message type has a `type` literal and a strongly-typed `payload`. Response types are paired per message type.

**Step 3 — Implement chrome.runtime.sendMessage patterns**
For one-shot request/response between extension contexts. Key rules:
- Listener must `return true` if the response is sent asynchronously (inside a Promise or async function)
- `chrome.runtime.lastError` MUST be checked in the callback — unhandled errors throw in MV3
- Content scripts cannot receive messages via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` — use `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` from the service worker with the target tab's ID

**Step 4 — Implement chrome.tabs.sendMessage (service worker → content)**
Service worker must resolve the target tab ID before sending. Use `chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true })` or receive the tab ID from the content script's original message (sender.tab.id).

**Step 5 — Implement port-based long-lived connections**
Use `chrome.runtime.connect` for streaming scenarios (AI token streaming, progress updates, live data feeds). Ports stay open until explicitly disconnected. Each side must handle `port.onDisconnect` to clean up.

**Step 6 — Add Chrome 146+ error handling**
Chrome 146 changed message listener error behavior: uncaught errors in listeners now reject the Promise returned by `sendMessage` on the sender side. Wrap all listener handlers in try/catch and send structured error responses.

#### Example

```typescript
// src/types/messages.ts — discriminated union message types
export type ExtensionMessage =
  | { type: 'SUMMARIZE_PAGE'; payload: { text: string; tabId: number } }
  | { type: 'GET_SETTINGS'; payload: Record<string, never> }
  | { type: 'UPDATE_SETTINGS'; payload: Partial<Settings> }
  | { type: 'OPEN_SIDEBAR'; payload: { tabId: number } };

export type ExtensionResponse<T extends ExtensionMessage> =
  T extends { type: 'SUMMARIZE_PAGE' } ? { summary: string; error?: string } :
  T extends { type: 'GET_SETTINGS' } ? { settings: Settings } :
  T extends { type: 'UPDATE_SETTINGS' } ? { ok: boolean } :
  T extends { type: 'OPEN_SIDEBAR' } ? { ok: boolean } :
  never;

export interface Settings {
  useBuiltinAI: boolean;
  externalApiKey: string;
  maxLength: number;
}
```

```typescript
// background.ts — typed message handler
import type { ExtensionMessage } from './types/messages';

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(
  (message: ExtensionMessage, sender, sendResponse) => {
    // CRITICAL: return true to keep channel open for async response
    (async () => {
      try {
        switch (message.type) {
          case 'SUMMARIZE_PAGE': {
            const summary = await summarize(message.payload.text);
            sendResponse({ summary });
            break;
          }
          case 'GET_SETTINGS': {
            const result = await chrome.storage.sync.get('settings');
            sendResponse({ settings: result['settings'] as Settings });
            break;
          }
          default:
            sendResponse({ error: 'Unknown message type' });
        }
      } catch (err) {
        // Chrome 146+: send error response instead of letting it throw
        sendResponse({ error: String(err) });
      }
    })();
    return true; // MUST return true — async response
  }
);
```

```typescript
// Port-based streaming (service worker → sidebar/popup)
// background.ts
chrome.runtime.onConnect.addListener((port) => {
  if (port.name !== 'ai-stream') return;

  port.onMessage.addListener(async (message: { text: string }) => {
    try {
      const session = await chrome.aiLanguageModel.create();
      const stream = session.promptStreaming(message.text);

      for await (const chunk of stream) {
        port.postMessage({ type: 'CHUNK', content: chunk });
      }
      port.postMessage({ type: 'DONE' });
      session.destroy();
    } catch (err) {
      port.postMessage({ type: 'ERROR', error: String(err) });
    }
  });

  port.onDisconnect.addListener(() => {
    // cleanup — sidebar/popup was closed
  });
});

// sidebar.ts — connect and stream
const port = chrome.runtime.connect({ name: 'ai-stream' });
port.postMessage({ text: selectedText });

port.onMessage.addListener((msg: { type: string; content?: string; error?: string }) => {
  if (msg.type === 'CHUNK') appendToOutput(msg.content ?? '');
  if (msg.type === 'DONE') finalizeOutput();
  if (msg.type === 'ERROR') showError(msg.error ?? 'Unknown error');
});

port.onDisconnect.addListener(() => {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.error('[Sidebar] Port disconnected with error:', chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  }
});
```

# ext-storage

Typed Chrome storage patterns — choose the right storage tier, define schema, implement typed helpers, handle schema migrations, and monitor quota. Prevents the #3 MV3 failure: storing state in service worker JS variables that reset on termination.

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — Choose storage type**
| Type | Capacity | Persistence | Sync | Use For |
|------|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `chrome.storage.local` | 10 MB | Until uninstall | No | User data, large payloads, cached content |
| `chrome.storage.sync` | 100 KB / 8 KB per item | Cross-device | Yes | Settings, small preferences |
| `chrome.storage.session` | 10 MB | Until browser closes | No | Ephemeral state that service worker needs across terminations |
| `chrome.storage.managed` | Read-only | Admin-controlled | No | Enterprise policy |

CRITICAL: `chrome.storage.session` is the correct replacement for service worker JS variables. If you need state to survive a 30-second termination but clear on browser close, use session storage.

**Step 2 — Define TypeScript storage schema**
Create `src/types/storage.ts` with versioned schema interface. Include a `version` field for migration tracking.

**Step 3 — Implement typed get/set helpers**
Create `src/lib/storage.ts` with typed wrappers that preserve the schema type. Avoid `chrome.storage.*.get(null)` which returns `any` — always specify keys.

**Step 4 — Add migration logic**
On `chrome.runtime.onInstalled` with `reason === 'update'`, check stored schema version and run incremental migrations. Each migration transforms data from version N to N+1.

**Step 5 — Implement quota monitoring**
Chrome storage has hard limits that throw `QUOTA_BYTES_PER_ITEM` and `QUOTA_BYTES` errors on write. Wrap all writes with error handling and warn the user or prune old data when approaching 80% capacity.

#### Example

```typescript
// src/types/storage.ts — versioned storage schema
export const STORAGE_VERSION = 2;

export interface StorageSchema {
  version: number;
  settings: {
    useBuiltinAI: boolean;
    externalApiKey: string;
    maxLength: number;
    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  };
  cache: {
    lastSummary: string;
    lastUrl: string;
    timestamp: number;
  } | null;
}

export const STORAGE_DEFAULTS: StorageSchema = {
  version: STORAGE_VERSION,
  settings: {
    useBuiltinAI: true,
    externalApiKey: '',
    maxLength: 500,
    theme: 'system',
  },
  cache: null,
};
```

```typescript
// src/lib/storage.ts — typed get/set helpers with quota monitoring

import type { StorageSchema } from '../types/storage';
import { STORAGE_DEFAULTS, STORAGE_VERSION } from '../types/storage';

type StorageKey = keyof StorageSchema;

export async function storageGet<K extends StorageKey>(
  key: K
): Promise<StorageSchema[K]> {
  const result = await chrome.storage.local.get(key);
  return (result[key] as StorageSchema[K]) ?? STORAGE_DEFAULTS[key];
}

export async function storageSet<K extends StorageKey>(
  key: K,
  value: StorageSchema[K]
): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await chrome.storage.local.set({ [key]: value });
  } catch (err) {
    const error = err as Error;
    if (error.message.includes('QUOTA_BYTES')) {
      console.warn('[Storage] Quota exceeded — clearing cache');
      await chrome.storage.local.remove('cache');
      // retry once after clearing cache
      await chrome.storage.local.set({ [key]: value });
    } else {
      throw err;
    }
  }
}

// Quota monitoring — warn at 80% capacity
export async function checkStorageQuota(): Promise<void> {
  const bytesUsed = await chrome.storage.local.getBytesInUse(null);
  const quota = chrome.storage.local.QUOTA_BYTES; // 10 MB = 10,485,760 bytes
  const pct = (bytesUsed / quota) * 100;
  if (pct > 80) {
    console.warn(`[Storage] ${pct.toFixed(1)}% of local storage used (${bytesUsed} / ${quota} bytes)`);
  }
}

// Migration runner — call on onInstalled with reason='update'
export async function runMigrations(): Promise<void> {
  const stored = await chrome.storage.local.get('version');
  const currentVersion = (stored['version'] as number | undefined) ?? 1;

  if (currentVersion < 2) {
    // v1 → v2: renamed 'apiKey' to 'externalApiKey'
    const legacy = await chrome.storage.local.get('settings');
    const legacySettings = legacy['settings'] as Record<string, unknown> | undefined;
    if (legacySettings?.['apiKey']) {
      await chrome.storage.local.set({
        settings: { ...legacySettings, externalApiKey: legacySettings['apiKey'], apiKey: undefined },
        version: 2,
      });
    }
  }

  await chrome.storage.local.set({ version: STORAGE_VERSION });
}
```

# mv3-scaffold

Manifest V3 project scaffolding — detect extension type, generate minimal-permission manifest, scaffold service worker with correct lifecycle patterns, scaffold content script, and generate build config. Prevents the #1 MV3 mistake: carrying MV2 mental models (background pages, remote scripts, setTimeout for keepalive) into an MV3 project.

#### Workflow

**Step 1 — Detect or clarify extension type**
Use read_file on any existing `manifest.json` or project description to classify the extension type:
- **popup**: user-triggered UI (toolbar button → popup.html)
- **sidebar**: persistent panel (chrome.sidePanel API, Chrome 114+)
- **content-injector**: modifies host pages (content scripts + optional popup)
- **background-only**: no visible UI, reacts to events (alarms, network, tabs)
- **devtools**: extends Chrome DevTools panel

If undetectable from files, ask the user. Extension type determines which APIs, permissions, and scaffold components are generated.

**Step 2 — Generate minimal-permission manifest.json**
Emit `manifest.json` with only the permissions required for the detected type. Flag over-permissioning immediately — requesting `<all_urls>` when only `activeTab` is needed is the #1 CWS rejection cause.

Key MV3 manifest rules:
- `"manifest_version": 3` — mandatory, MV2 deprecated Jan 2023
- `"background"` uses `{ "service_worker": "background.js" }` — NOT `"scripts"` array
- `"action"` replaces `"browser_action"` and `"page_action"`
- No `"content_security_policy"` that relaxes `script-src` (blocks CWS review)
- No `"web_accessible_resources"` with `matches: ["<all_urls>"]` unless justified
- External URLs in `"host_permissions"` require justification in CWS dashboard

**Step 3 — Scaffold service worker (CRITICAL lifecycle patterns)**
Generate `background.ts` / `background.js` with the following non-negotiable patterns:

CRITICAL: service workers terminate after 30 seconds of idle. Every assumption that breaks because of this:
- JS variables reset on termination — use `chrome.storage.session` for ephemeral state
- `setTimeout` / `setInterval` — NOT reliable across terminations, use `chrome.alarms`
- Pending async operations mid-flight get killed — use alarm + storage to resume
- `fetch()` initiated in a response to a non-event call may not complete

All event listeners MUST be registered at the top level synchronously — NOT inside `async` functions, Promises, or conditionals. Chrome only registers listeners present during the initial synchronous execution of the service worker.

**Step 4 — Scaffold content script**
Generate `content.ts` with correct isolation model:
- Runs in an **isolated world** — own JS context, cannot access page's JS variables
- Has access to the DOM but NOT to `chrome.storage`, `chrome.tabs`, most `chrome.*` APIs (exceptions: `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.storage`, `chrome.i18n`)
- Must message the service worker for privileged operations
- Inject only when needed — prefer `"run_at": "document_idle"` over `"document_start"`

**Step 5 — Scaffold popup/sidebar UI**
For popup and sidebar types, generate `popup.html` + `popup.ts`:
- Popup HTML MUST NOT load remote scripts (`<script src="https://...">`) — blocked by CSP
- All scripts must be local and listed in `web_accessible_resources` if loaded from content scripts
- Popup closes when user clicks away — don't depend on popup state for background operations
- For sidebar: register `chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })`

**Step 6 — Generate build config**
Emit a build configuration based on detected tooling:
- If `vite` in `package.json` → emit `vite.config.ts` using `@crxjs/vite-plugin` (hot-reload for extension dev)
- Otherwise → emit vanilla TypeScript config with `tsc` + file copy script
- Include `web-ext` config for local loading and reload

#### Example

```json
// manifest.json — content-injector type, minimal permissions
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Page Summarizer",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Summarize any page using built-in AI or an external API.",
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "sidePanel"],
  "host_permissions": [],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js",
    "type": "module"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"],
      "run_at": "document_idle"
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Summarize this page",
    "default_icon": { "128": "icons/icon128.png" }
  },
  "side_panel": {
    "default_path": "sidebar.html"
  },
  "icons": { "128": "icons/icon128.png" },
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
  }
}
```

```typescript
// background.ts — correct MV3 service worker patterns
// CRITICAL: all listeners registered synchronously at top level

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(({ reason }) => {
  if (reason === 'install') {
    console.log('[SW] Extension installed');
  }
});

// Use chrome.alarms — NOT setTimeout (alarms survive service worker termination)
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  chrome.alarms.create('heartbeat', { periodInMinutes: 1 });
});

chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  if (alarm.name === 'heartbeat') {
    // periodic work here — service worker woke up for this
  }
});

// Message handler — registered synchronously, NOT inside async function
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === 'SUMMARIZE_PAGE') {
    // Return true to keep the message channel open for async response
    handleSummarize(message.payload).then(sendResponse);
    return true;
  }
});

async function handleSummarize(payload: { text: string }): Promise<{ summary: string }> {
  // Service worker is alive for the duration of this message handler
  const summary = await callExternalApi(payload.text);
  return { summary };
}
```

```typescript
// content.ts — isolated world, limited chrome.* access
const selectedText = window.getSelection()?.toString() ?? '';

if (selectedText.length > 0) {
  // Content scripts can message service worker
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
    { type: 'SUMMARIZE_PAGE', payload: { text: selectedText } },
    (response: { summary: string }) => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        console.error('[Content] Message failed:', chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
        return;
      }
      displaySummary(response.summary);
    }
  );
}

function displaySummary(summary: string): void {
  const panel = document.createElement('div');
  panel.id = 'rune-summarizer-panel';
  panel.textContent = summary;
  document.body.appendChild(panel);
}
```
