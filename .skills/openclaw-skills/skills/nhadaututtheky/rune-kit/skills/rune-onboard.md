> **RUNE COMPLIANCE**: Before ANY code response, you MUST:
> 1. Classify this request (CODE_CHANGE | QUESTION | DEBUG | REVIEW | EXPLORE)
> 2. Route through the correct Rune skill (see skill-router routing table)
> 3. Follow the skill's workflow — do NOT freelance or skip steps
> Violation: writing code without skill routing = incorrect behavior.

## Platform Constraints

- MUST NOT: Never run commands containing hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens. Scan all shell commands for secret patterns before execution.
- MUST: After editing JS/TS files, ensure code follows project formatting conventions (Prettier/ESLint).
- MUST: After editing .ts/.tsx files, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors).
- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

Auto-generate project context for AI sessions. Scans the codebase and creates a CLAUDE.md project config plus .rune/ state directory so every future session starts with full context. Saves 10-20 minutes of re-explaining per session on undocumented projects.

## Triggers

- `/rune onboard` — manual invocation on any project
- Called by `rescue` as Phase 0 (understand before refactoring)
- Auto-trigger: when no CLAUDE.md exists in project root

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): deep codebase scan — structure, frameworks, patterns, dependencies
- `autopsy` (L2): when project appears messy or undocumented — health assessment

## Called By (inbound)

- User: `/rune onboard` manual invocation
- `rescue` (L1): Phase 0 — understand legacy project before refactoring
- `cook` (L1): if no CLAUDE.md found, onboard first

## Executable Steps

### Step 1 — Full Scan
Invoke `rune-scout.md` on the project root. Collect:
- Top-level directory structure (depth 2)
- All config files: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`
- Python environment markers: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `conda-meta/`, `.python-version`
- Entry point files: `main.*`, `index.*`, `app.*`, `server.*`
- Test directory names and test file patterns
- CI/CD config files: `.github/workflows/`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`
- README.md if present

Do not read every source file — scout gives the skeleton. Use read_file only on config files and entry points.

### Step 2 — Detect Tech Stack
From the scan output, determine with confidence:
- **Language**: TypeScript | JavaScript | Python | Rust | Go | other
- **Framework**: Next.js | Vite+React | SvelteKit | Express | FastAPI | Django | none | other
- **Package manager**: npm | pnpm | yarn | pip | poetry | cargo | go modules
- **Test framework**: Vitest | Jest | pytest | cargo test | go test | none
- **Build tool**: tsc | vite | webpack | esbuild | cargo | none
- **Linter/formatter**: ESLint | Biome | Ruff | Black | Clippy | none
- **Python environment** (if Python project): detect from project markers:
  - `.venv/` or `venv/` directory → venv
  - `poetry.lock` → poetry
  - `uv.lock` → uv
  - `.python-version` → pyenv
  - `conda-meta/` or `environment.yml` → conda
  - `Pipfile.lock` → pipenv
  - None found → none (note: recommend setting up a virtual environment)

If a field cannot be determined with confidence, write "unknown" — do not guess.

### Step 3 — Extract Conventions
Read 3–5 representative source files (pick files with the most connections in the project — typically the main module, a route/controller file, and a utility file). Extract:
- **Naming patterns**: camelCase | snake_case | PascalCase for files, functions, variables
- **Import style**: named imports | default imports | barrel files (index.ts)
- **Error handling pattern**: try/catch | Result type | error boundary | unhandled
- **State management**: React Context | Zustand | Redux | Svelte stores | none
- **API pattern**: REST | tRPC | GraphQL | SDK | none
- **Test structure**: co-located (`file.test.ts`) | separate directory (`tests/`) | none

Write extracted conventions as bullet points — be specific, not generic.

### Step 4 — Generate CLAUDE.md
Write_file to create `CLAUDE.md` at the project root. Populate every section using data from Steps 2–3. Do not leave template placeholders — if data is unknown, write "unknown" or omit the section. Use the template below as the exact structure.

If a `CLAUDE.md` already exists, Read_file to load it first, then merge — preserve any human-written sections (comments starting with `<!-- manual -->`) and update auto-detected sections only.

### Step 5 — Initialize .rune/ Directory
Run_command to create the directory: `mkdir -p .rune`

Write_file to create each file:
- `.rune/conventions.md` — paste the extracted conventions from Step 3 in full detail
- `.rune/decisions.md` — create with header `# Architecture Decisions` and one placeholder row in a markdown table (Date | Decision | Rationale | Status)
- `.rune/progress.md` — create with header `# Progress Log` and one placeholder entry
- `.rune/session-log.md` — create with header `# Session Log` and current date as first entry
- `.rune/instincts.md` — create with header `# Project Instincts` and a description: "Learned trigger→action patterns. Managed by session-bridge. See session-bridge SKILL.md Step 5.7 for format."
- `.rune/contract.md` — generate a starter contract based on the detected tech stack:
  - Copy structure from `docs/CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md`
  - Customize rules based on Step 2 findings (e.g., Python → add `no bare except`, Node.js → add `no console.log`, SQL database → add parameterized queries rule)
  - Remove sections that don't apply (e.g., `contract.operations` for a library with no deployed service)
  - The contract is a starting point — tell the user to review and customize it

### Step 5.5 — Load Existing Instincts

If `.rune/instincts.md` already exists and contains instinct entries, read it and include a summary in the Onboard Report under `### Learned Instincts`. This tells the agent what project-specific behaviors have been learned from previous sessions.

For each instinct with confidence ≥0.6, include in the report:
- Trigger and action (one line)
- Confidence level

Instincts with confidence <0.6 are still learning — mention count but don't list individually.

**Why**: Onboard is the first skill that runs in a new session. Surfacing instincts here ensures the agent starts with project-specific learned behaviors, not just static conventions.

### Step 6b — Generate DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md

Use the data from Steps 2–3 to generate `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` — a human-readable onboarding guide for new team members joining the project. This is NOT AI context. This is plain English for humans.

Write_file to create `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` with this template:

```markdown
# Developer Guide: [Project Name]

## What This Does
[2 sentences max. What problem does this project solve? Who uses it?]

## Quick Setup
[Copy-paste commands to get from zero to running locally]
```bash
# [Python projects] Activate virtual environment
[detected activation command — e.g., source .venv/bin/activate | poetry shell | uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate]

# Install dependencies
[detected command — e.g., pip install -e ".[dev]" | poetry install | npm install]

# Run development server
[detected command]

# Run tests
[detected command]
```

## Key Files
[5–10 most important files with one-line description each]
- `[path]` — [what it does]

## How to Contribute
1. Fork or branch from main
2. Make changes, run tests: `[test command]`
3. Open a PR — describe what and why

## Common Issues
[Top 3 "it doesn't work" situations with fixes. Only include issues you can infer from the codebase — e.g., missing .env, wrong Node version, database not running]

[Python projects — always include these if applicable:]
- **ModuleNotFoundError** → Virtual environment not activated. Run: `[activation command]`
- **ImportError: cannot import name X** → Dependencies outdated. Run: `[install command]`
- **PYTHONPATH issues** → If using src layout, install in editable mode: `pip install -e .`

## Who to Ask
[If git log reveals consistent contributors, list them. Otherwise omit this section.]
```

If `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` already exists, skip and log **INFO**: "Skipped existing .rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md — manual content preserved."

### Step 6c — Suggest L4 Extension Packs

Based on the detected tech stack from Step 2, recommend relevant L4 extension packs. Use the mapping table below to find applicable packs. Only suggest packs that match the detected stack — do not suggest all packs.

| Detected Stack | Suggest Pack | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SvelteKit | `@rune/ui` | Frontend component patterns, design system, accessibility audit |
| Express, Fastify, FastAPI, Django, NestJS, Go HTTP | `@rune/backend` | API patterns, auth flows, middleware, rate limiting |
| Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD config | `@rune/devops` | Container patterns, deployment pipelines, infrastructure as code |
| React Native, Expo, Flutter, SwiftUI | `@rune/mobile` | Mobile architecture, navigation patterns, offline sync |
| Security-focused codebase (auth, payments, HIPAA/PCI markers) | `@rune/security` | Threat modeling, OWASP flows, compliance patterns |
| Trading, finance, pricing, portfolio, market data | `@rune/trading` | Market data validation, risk calculation, backtesting patterns |
| Subscription billing, tenant isolation, feature flags | `@rune/saas` | Multi-tenancy, billing integration, feature flag patterns |
| Cart, checkout, product catalog, inventory, payments | `@rune/ecommerce` | Cart patterns, payment flows, inventory management |
| ML models, training pipelines, embeddings, LLM integration | `@rune/ai-ml` | Model evaluation, prompt patterns, inference optimization |
| Game loop, physics, entity systems, multiplayer | `@rune/gamedev` | Game architecture, ECS patterns, netcode |
| CMS, blog, newsletter, SEO, content workflows | `@rune/content` | Content modeling, SEO patterns, editorial workflows |
| Analytics, dashboards, metrics, data pipelines, BI | `@rune/analytics` | Data modeling, visualization patterns, pipeline architecture |

If 0 packs match: omit this section from the report (no suggestions is correct for a generic project).

**Community pack discovery**: Also check if `.rune/community-packs/registry.json` exists. If it does, list installed community packs alongside core pack suggestions. If community packs are installed, include them under a `### Installed Community Packs` subsection.

If ≥1 packs match: include in the Onboard Report under a `### Suggested L4 Packs` section:

```
### Suggested L4 Packs
Based on your detected stack ([detected frameworks]), these extension packs may be useful:

- **@rune/[pack]** — [one-line reason based on detected stack]
  Install: [link or command when available]
```

### Step 6d — Context Budget Check

Audit the project's baseline context cost from MCP servers and agent configurations. This helps developers understand why their context window fills up faster than expected.

1. Count MCP tools available (from session start messages or `settings.json`)
2. Check CLAUDE.md line count
3. If total MCP tools >80 or CLAUDE.md >150 lines, include a **Context Budget Advisory** in the Onboard Report:

```
### Context Budget Advisory
- **MCP tools loaded**: [count] across [N] servers
- **CLAUDE.md size**: [N] lines
- **Estimated baseline**: ~[N]k tokens before any work begins
- **Recommendation**: [specific advice — disable unused MCP servers, move CLAUDE.md details to .rune/]
```

**Skip if**: Total MCP tools ≤80 AND CLAUDE.md ≤150 lines (healthy baseline).

### Step 6e — AI-Driven Interview (Optional, User-Initiated)

When invoked as `/rune onboard --interview` or when the project is too ambiguous for automated detection (e.g., no package.json, no clear entry point, mixed languages), switch to **conversational onboarding** — the AI asks targeted questions instead of relying solely on file scanning.

#### Interview Flow

Ask 5-8 questions in sequence, adapting based on answers. Start broad, narrow based on responses:

```
Q1: "What does this project do in one sentence?"
    → Captures purpose (README may be missing or outdated)

Q2: "Who uses this — internal team, external users, or both?"
    → Determines audience, affects DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md tone

Q3: "What's the main entry point — where does execution start?"
    → Bypasses file scanning for complex monorepos

Q4: "What commands do you use daily? (dev server, tests, build)"
    → Gets verified commands instead of guessing from config files

Q5: "Any areas of the codebase you'd warn a new developer about?"
    → Captures tribal knowledge that no scan can detect

Q6: "Are there external services this depends on? (databases, APIs, queues)"
    → Maps integration points for Architecture Map

Q7: "What's the deployment story — how does code get to production?"
    → Captures CI/CD context

Q8 (conditional): "Anything else a new session should know that's not in the code?"
    → Catches edge cases, workarounds, known issues
```

#### Interview Rules

- **Adapt**: Skip questions that were already answered by earlier responses. If Q1 reveals "it's a Next.js app", don't ask about the framework.
- **Validate**: Cross-reference answers with actual file scan results. If user says "we use Jest" but `vitest.config.ts` exists, ask to clarify.
- **Merge**: Interview answers supplement (not replace) automated scan. Scan provides facts, interview provides context and intent.
- **Store**: Save interview responses as high-confidence entries in `.rune/conventions.md` and `.rune/cumulative-notes.md` (tagged `[from-interview]`)

#### When to Auto-Suggest Interview

Suggest switching to interview mode (but don't force it) when:
- Step 2 produces 3+ "unknown" fields in tech stack detection
- Project has no README.md and no package.json/pyproject.toml/Cargo.toml
- Project appears to be a monorepo with 3+ distinct sub-projects

Output: `"ℹ️ This project is hard to auto-detect. Run /rune onboard --interview for guided setup."`

### Step 7 — Commit
Run_command to stage and commit the generated files:
```bash
git add CLAUDE.md .rune/ && git commit -m "chore: initialize rune project context"
```

If `git` is not available or the directory is not a git repo, skip this step and add an INFO note to the report: "Not a git repository — files written but not committed."

If any of the `.rune/` files already exist, do not overwrite them (they may contain human-written decisions). Log **INFO**: "Skipped existing .rune/[file] — manual content preserved."

### Generated
- CLAUDE.md (project configuration)
- .rune/conventions.md (detected patterns)
- .rune/decisions.md (initialized)
- .rune/progress.md (initialized)
- .rune/session-log.md (initialized)
- .rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md (human onboarding guide)

### Skipped (already exist)
- [list of files not overwritten]

### Learned Instincts (if any)
- [trigger] → [action] (confidence: [0.6-0.9]) — for each high-confidence instinct
- [N] low-confidence instincts still learning

### Observations
- [notable patterns or anomalies found]
- [potential issues detected]
- [recommendations for the developer]

### Suggested L4 Packs
- **@rune/[pack]** — [reason] (only shown if applicable packs detected)
```

## Constraints

1. MUST scan actual project files — never generate CLAUDE.md from assumptions
2. MUST detect and respect existing CLAUDE.md content — merge, don't overwrite
3. MUST include: build commands, test commands, lint commands, project structure
4. MUST NOT include obvious/generic advice ("write clean code", "use meaningful names")
5. MUST verify generated commands actually work by running them
6. MUST NOT overwrite existing .rune/ files — always preserve human-written content

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md generated from README alone (no file scan) | CRITICAL | Step 1 MUST invoke scout — never skip actual file scanning |
| DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md contains generic placeholder text not derived from project | HIGH | Every section must reference actual detected commands, files, and patterns — no generic advice |
| Overwriting existing .rune/ files with manual content | CRITICAL | Check file existence before every Write — skip and log INFO if exists |
| Common Issues section fabricated (no actual issues detected) | MEDIUM | Only list issues inferable from codebase (missing .env, Node version, etc.) — omit section if none found |

## Done When

- CLAUDE.md written (or merged) with all detected tech stack fields populated
- .rune/ directory initialized with conventions, decisions, progress, session-log, instincts
- .rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md written with setup commands from actual scan
- All generated commands verified to exist in package.json/Makefile/etc.
- Onboard Report emitted with Generated + Skipped + Observations sections

## Returns

| Artifact | Format | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Project AI config | Markdown | `CLAUDE.md` (project root) |
| Detected conventions | Markdown | `.rune/conventions.md` |
| Decision log (initialized) | Markdown | `.rune/decisions.md` |
| Developer onboarding guide | Markdown | `.rune/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` |
| Session/progress files | Markdown | `.rune/progress.md`, `.rune/session-log.md` |

## Cost Profile

~2000-5000 tokens input, ~1000-2000 tokens output. Sonnet for analysis quality.

**Scope guardrail:** onboard generates project context files — it does not modify source code, install dependencies, or change project configuration.
