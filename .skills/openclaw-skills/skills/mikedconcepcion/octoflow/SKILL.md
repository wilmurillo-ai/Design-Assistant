description: >
  Use when the user wants to run GPU-accelerated computations, analyze data,
  process images/audio/video, train ML models, or generate code from natural language.
  OctoFlow turns English task descriptions into GPU programs via Vulkan.
  Also runs as an MCP server (`octoflow mcp-serve`) with 7 structured tools.
  No Python, no CUDA, no dependencies — single 4.5 MB binary.
  445 stdlib modules across 28 domains (sort, search, graph, matrix, stats, DSP, ML, etc.).
  150 GPU compute kernels. Loom Engine GPU VM with layer-streaming LLM inference.
  Use for: "sort a million numbers", "cluster this CSV", "blur this image",
  "plot my data", "calculate statistics", "run regression", "process audio".

# OctoFlow

GPU-native programming language. Describe tasks in English, run them on any GPU via Vulkan.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when** the user says:
- "sort a million numbers on GPU" / "benchmark GPU performance"
- "load this CSV and show me statistics" / "analyze my data"
- "cluster my dataset" / "run K-means" / "train a classifier"
- "blur this image" / "resize this BMP" / "encode a GIF"
- "plot height vs weight" / "create a scatter plot"
- "calculate the Sharpe ratio" / "compute correlation"
- "find primes" / "generate random numbers on GPU"
- "run linear regression on my dataset"
- "run a LLM on my GPU" / "inference on my GPU"

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- The user wants Python/JavaScript/Rust code (use the appropriate language tool)
- The task doesn't benefit from GPU acceleration or OctoFlow's built-in functions
- The user explicitly asks for a different language

## How to Run OctoFlow

### Chat mode (natural language to running code)
```bash
octoflow chat "sort 1M numbers on GPU"
```

### Run a .flow script
```bash
octoflow run program.flow
```

### Run with permissions (sandboxed by default)
```bash
# Allow reading data files
octoflow run analysis.flow --allow-read=./data

# Allow network access to specific domain
octoflow chat "fetch weather data" --allow-net=api.weather.com

# Allow writing output files
octoflow run report.flow --allow-read=./data --allow-write=./output
```

## Security Model

OctoFlow uses Deno-style permissions. **Everything is denied by default.**

| Permission | Default | How to enable | Example |
|------------|---------|---------------|---------|
| File read | **DENIED** | `--allow-read=./data` | Read CSV from `./data` only |
| File write | **DENIED** | `--allow-write=./output` | Write results to `./output` only |
| Network | **DENIED** | `--allow-net=api.example.com` | Fetch from one domain only |
| Process exec | **DENIED** | `--allow-exec=curl` | Allow `curl` only |

Without flags, OctoFlow can only read `.flow` source files and print to stdout.
No file access, no network, no subprocesses unless the user explicitly opts in.

## MCP Server

OctoFlow can run as an MCP server for AI agent integration:

```bash
octoflow mcp-serve
```

Add to your OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, or Cursor config:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"octoflow": {"command": "octoflow", "args": ["mcp-serve"]}}}
```

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `octoflow_run` | Execute OctoFlow code directly |
| `octoflow_chat` | Natural language to GPU code |
| `octoflow_check` | Validate .flow syntax |
| `octoflow_gpu_sort` | GPU-accelerated sorting |
| `octoflow_gpu_stats` | GPU statistical operations |
| `octoflow_image` | Image processing (BMP, GIF) |
| `octoflow_csv` | CSV data analysis |

## Common Patterns

### Data Analysis
```bash
# User: "analyze sales.csv and show trends"
octoflow chat "load sales.csv, compute monthly averages, and plot the trend" --allow-read=.
```

### GPU Compute
```bash
# User: "sort a large dataset on GPU"
octoflow chat "generate 1M random numbers on GPU and sort them"
```

### Machine Learning
```bash
# User: "cluster my customers"
octoflow chat "load customers.csv, run K-means with 5 clusters, print cluster sizes" --allow-read=.
```

### Image Processing
```bash
# User: "blur this photo"
octoflow chat "load photo.bmp, apply gaussian blur, save as blurred.bmp" --allow-read=. --allow-write=.
```

### Statistics
```bash
# User: "what's the correlation between these columns?"
octoflow chat "load data.csv, compute Pearson correlation between col1 and col2" --allow-read=.
```

## Data Storage

OctoFlow optionally saves your preferences to `~/.octoflow/` (user-level) and `.octoflow/` (per-project).

Contents: which stdlib modules you use frequently and corrections from previous sessions.

- **No telemetry.** No data is sent anywhere.
- **No network calls** unless you explicitly use `--allow-net`.
- **All data stays local** on your machine.
- **Disable entirely** with `--no-memory` flag — nothing is saved.
- **Project config** via `OCTOFLOW.md` in your project root (like `.eslintrc` or `pyproject.toml`).
