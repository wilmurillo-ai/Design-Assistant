# TsArr

Manage Servarr apps through the `tsarr` CLI.

## Start

- Verify the CLI is available with `tsarr --help`.
- If setup or service health is unclear, read [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) and start with `tsarr doctor`.
- Prefer `--json` when selecting IDs, extracting fields, or comparing results.

## Safety

- Inspect before mutating.
- Fetch the current item before `edit` or `delete` when possible.
- Avoid `--yes` on destructive commands unless the user explicitly wants non-interactive execution.
- If the user says "Arr", "library", or "queue" without naming a service, clarify which service to use.

## Routing

- Read [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) for installation expectations, configuration, and connectivity checks.
- Read [references/common-workflows.md](references/common-workflows.md) for health checks, library browsing, search, add, queue, history, refresh, and delete flows.
- Read [references/service-cheatsheet.md](references/service-cheatsheet.md) to map a user request to the correct `service resource action` command.

## Notes

- Trust the command patterns in these references over stale prose elsewhere.
- Keep responses operational: show the command you plan to run, summarize the result, and call out any destructive effect before you execute it.
