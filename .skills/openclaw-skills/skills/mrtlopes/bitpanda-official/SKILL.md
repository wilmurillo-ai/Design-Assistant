# Bitpanda

Query a Bitpanda account through the API using the bundled `scripts/bitpanda.sh` CLI.

## Prerequisites

Set `BITPANDA_API_KEY` environment variable with a key from https://web.bitpanda.com/my-account/apikey

Verify access works:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh balances --page-size 5
```

## CLI Usage

All commands are invoked as `bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh <command> [options]`. Output is JSON.

### Start here: `portfolio`

For any request about the user's holdings, balances, or portfolio, **always use `portfolio` first**:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh portfolio
```
It handles pagination, zero-balance filtering, asset name resolution, EUR price enrichment, and **aggregation by asset** (combining regular, staking, and index wallets) automatically. Use `--sort value` to sort by EUR value descending (default: alphabetical by name). Returns:
```json
{
  "wallets": [
    {"asset_name": "Bitcoin", "asset_symbol": "BTC", "balance": "0.123", "eur_price": "95000", "eur_value": 11685.0, "asset_id": "...", "wallets": [{"wallet_id": "...", "wallet_type": null, "balance": "0.123"}]}
  ],
  "count": 25,
  "total_eur": 50000.0
}
```

Do NOT manually paginate `balances` + call `asset` per ID — `portfolio` does this for you.

#### Handling null prices

When `portfolio` returns wallets with `eur_price: null`, the exact symbol didn't match the ticker. Report these assets to the user.

### Price commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `price <SYMBOL>` | Get price, currency, and daily change for a single asset. |
| `prices` | List prices for held assets. |
| `prices --all` | List all available ticker prices. |

### Trades: `trades`

For any request about **buy/sell history**, recent purchases, or trade activity, **always use `trades` first** — NOT `all-transactions`:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh trades [options]
```
It auto-paginates transactions, filters for buys/sells, resolves asset names, and enriches with asset type and price. Returns:
```json
[
  {"date": "2025-12-22T16:20:48Z", "operation": "buy", "asset_name": "Bitcoin", "asset_symbol": "BTC", "asset_type": "cryptocoin", "amount": "0.5", "current_eur_price": "95000", "trade_id": "...", "asset_id": "..."}
]
```

Options:
- `--operation buy|sell` — filter by trade direction (default: both)
- `--asset-type <type>` — filter by asset type: `cryptocoin`, `metal`, `stock`, `commodity`, `etf`, etc.
- `--limit <n>` — number of trades to return (default 5)
- `--from <datetime>` / `--to <datetime>` — date range filter

Examples:
```bash
# Last 3 purchases
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh trades --operation buy --limit 3

# Last 3 crypto purchases
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh trades --operation buy --asset-type cryptocoin --limit 3

# All trades in January 2026
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh trades --from 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z --to 2026-02-01T00:00:00Z --limit 20
```

Do NOT manually paginate `all-transactions` + resolve asset names — `trades` does this for you.

### Other commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `balances` | Raw wallet list (use `--non-zero` to filter zeros). Only use when you need pagination control or filtering by asset_id. |
| `all-transactions` | Raw transaction list across all asset types. Only use when you need full transaction details, non-trade operations (rewards, deposits, etc.), or direct cursor control. |
| `asset <asset_id>` | Get single asset info. Response: `{"data": {"id": "...", "name": "Bitcoin", "symbol": "BTC"}}` |

### Pagination

`balances` and `all-transactions` use cursor pagination:
- `--before <cursor>` / `--after <cursor>` / `--page-size <n>` (1-100, default 25)

### Filtering

```bash
# Balances: filter by asset
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh balances --asset-id <uuid>

# Transactions: filter by direction and wallet
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh all-transactions --flow incoming --wallet-id <uuid>

# Transactions: filter by asset
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh all-transactions --asset-id <uuid>

# Transactions: filter by date range
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh all-transactions --from 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z --to 2024-02-01T00:00:00Z
```

## Common Tasks

**Last purchases**:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh trades --operation buy --limit 3
```

**Recent trades**:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh trades --limit 10
```

**List recent transactions (all types including rewards, dividends)**:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh all-transactions --page-size 10
```

**Check current BTC price**:
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/bitpanda.sh price BTC
```

## Transaction fields

- `operation_type`: The category of operation (e.g. `buy`, `sell`, `deposit`, `withdrawal`, `transfer`, `staking`).
- `flow`: `incoming` (credit) or `outgoing` (debit).
- `compensates`: Links to a reversed/corrected transaction ID (null for normal transactions).
- `trade_id`: Present when the transaction resulted from a trade; null for deposits/withdrawals/staking.
