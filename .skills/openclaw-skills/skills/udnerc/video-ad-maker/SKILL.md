  Video Ad Maker — Create Marketing and Advertising Videos with AI.
  Produce scroll-stopping ad creatives from product footage or raw descriptions
  without a production team. Upload product photos or demo clips and describe your
  ad concept: the AI builds attention-grabbing videos with bold text overlays,
  call-to-action animations, branded color schemes, and pacing optimized for
  paid social placements. Edit by chatting: "make a 15-second product showcase
  with price pop-up at the end" or "add urgency text like Limited Time Offer"
  or "match our brand colors blue and white." Handles Facebook and Instagram
  ad creatives, TikTok Spark Ad style videos, YouTube pre-roll and bumper ads,
  product launch announcement clips, seasonal sale and promotion videos, and
  A/B test variations with different hooks. Build multiple ad lengths from the
  same footage, swap headlines for split testing, and add platform-specific safe
  zones. Built for e-commerce brands running paid social, marketing agencies
  producing ad variations at scale, and small businesses making their first
  video ads. Export horizontal for YouTube, square for feeds, or vertical for
  Stories and Reels. Export as MP4. Supports jpg, png, gif, webp, mp4, mov,
  mp3, wav.

# Video Ad Maker - Ads That Convert

## 1. Role & Environment

You produce marketing video creatives from raw product assets with conversion-optimized pacing and platform-specific formatting. The backend handles video generation/editing but assumes a GUI exists. Your job:

1. **Relay** user requests to the backend via SSE
2. **Intercept** backend responses — replace GUI references with API actions
3. **Supplement** — handle export/render, credits, file delivery directly
4. **Translate** — present results in user's language with clear status

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated on first use |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`. Expires after 7 days; re-request with same `X-Client-Id`.

## 2. Request Router

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| "export" / "download" / "send me the video" | Export | Yes |
| "credits" / "balance" | Credits | Yes |
| "status" / "show tracks" | State | Yes |
| "upload" / user sends file | Upload | Yes |
| Everything else | SSE | No |

## 3. Core Flows

`$API` = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, `$TOKEN` = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, `$WEB` = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

All API requests MUST include:
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Create Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
```
Save `session_id`, `task_id`.

### 3.1 Send Message via SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```

### 3.2 Upload
**File**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL**: same endpoint, `-d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

### 3.3 Credits
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.4 Query State
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.5 Export
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'
```
Poll `GET $API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s.

### 3.6 Disconnect Recovery
Wait 30s, query state. After 5 unchanged polls, report failure.

## 4. GUI Translation

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click Export" | Render + deliver |
| "open timeline" | Show state |
| "drag/drop" | Send edit via SSE |
| "check account" | Show credits |

## 5. Ad Creation Tips

**Hook first**: "Start with the problem statement in big text for 2 seconds, then show the product" follows the proven pain-solution ad structure.

**Multiple lengths**: "Make 15-second, 30-second, and 60-second versions" from the same footage covers all platform requirements.

**A/B variations**: "Make two versions: one starting with the product, one starting with a question" creates split-test material.

**CTA placement**: "Add Shop Now button animation in the last 3 seconds" drives action at the decision moment.

## 6. Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Token expired | Re-auth |
| 1002 | Session gone | New session |
| 2001 | No credits | Show registration URL |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show formats |
| 402 | Export restricted | "Register at nemovideo.ai" |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait 30s, retry |

## 7. Limitations

- Aspect ratio change after generation requires regeneration
- YouTube/Spotify music URLs not supported; built-in library available
- Photo editing not supported; slideshow creation available
- Local files must be sent in chat or provided as URL
