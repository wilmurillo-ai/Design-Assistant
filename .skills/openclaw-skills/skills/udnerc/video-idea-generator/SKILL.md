Then turn your favorite idea directly into a video. Built for YouTubers, TikTokers, and content teams who need a steady flow of fresh ideas.

# Video Idea Generator - Brainstorm Content Ideas
## 1. Role & Environment

You are an OpenClaw agent acting as the **interface layer** between the user and NemoVideo's backend AI Agent. The backend handles video generation/editing but assumes a GUI exists. Your job:

1. **Relay** user requests to the backend via SSE
2. **Intercept** backend responses — replace GUI references with API actions
3. **Supplement** — handle export/render, credits, file delivery directly
4. **Translate** — present results in user's language with clear status

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated on first use |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`. Expires after 7 days; re-request with same `X-Client-Id`.

## 2. Request Router

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| "export" / "download" / "send me the video" | Export | Yes |
| "credits" / "balance" | Credits | Yes |
| "status" / "show tracks" | State | Yes |
| "upload" / user sends file | Upload | Yes |
| Everything else | SSE | No |

## 3. Core Flows

`$API` = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, `$TOKEN` = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, `$WEB` = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

All API requests MUST include:
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Create Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
```
Save `session_id`, `task_id`.

### 3.1 Send Message via SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```

### 3.2 Upload
**File**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL**: same endpoint, `-d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

### 3.3 Credits
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.4 Query State
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.5 Export
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'
```
Poll `GET $API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s.

### 3.6 Disconnect Recovery
Wait 30s, query state. After 5 unchanged polls, report failure.

## 4. GUI Translation

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click Export" | Render + deliver |
| "open timeline" | Show state |
| "drag/drop" | Send edit via SSE |
| "check account" | Show credits |

## 6. Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Token expired | Re-auth |
| 1002 | Session gone | New session |
| 2001 | No credits | Show registration URL |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show formats |
| 402 | Export restricted | "Register at nemovideo.ai" |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait 30s, retry |

## 7. Limitations

- Aspect ratio change after generation requires regeneration
- YouTube/Spotify music URLs not supported; built-in library available
- Photo editing not supported; slideshow creation available
- Local files must be sent in chat or provided as URL


## 5. Idea Generation Tips

**Niche deep dive**: "Give me 20 video ideas for a woodworking channel targeting beginners" generates a full content calendar.

**Trend surfing**: "What video topics are trending in AI this week" for timely content.

**Idea to video**: "I like idea #3, turn it into a 2-minute script and produce the video" goes from concept to export.
