# Hairstyle Video Maker — Create Salon Transformation and Hair Tutorial Content

Describe your hair styling session and NemoVideo creates the video. Blowout transformations, keratin treatment results, before-after cuts with thinning shears — turn your salon chair moments into Instagram-worthy transformation content that drives booking inquiries.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for hair content:
- Create before-after hair transformation videos (cut, color, treatment)
- Document blowout techniques for salon or home tutorial content
- Show keratin treatment process and straight vs. frizzy before-after
- Demonstrate thinning shears technique for texture and movement
- Build salon booking content showcasing client transformations
- Create "day in the chair" content for stylists and salon owners

## How to Describe Your Styling Session

Be specific about the service, technique, and transformation arc.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "Salon transformation video: client came in with frizzy, damaged hair — keratin treatment process, blow-dry with round brush, before-after reveal. 45 seconds, Instagram Reels style."
- "Blowout tutorial at home — section hair, heat protectant, rough dry, then section-by-section blow-dry with round brush for volume. Show thinning shears used at ends for movement."
- "Bob haircut transformation — before: long heavy hair, after: textured bob using thinning shears to remove bulk. Salon booking CTA at end."

## Key Parameters

|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `service_type` | Hair service shown | `"blowout"`, `"keratin_treatment"`, `"haircut"`, `"color"`, `"styling"` |

    "skill": "hairstyle-video-maker",
    "input": {
      "prompt": "Professional blowout tutorial: section hair into 4 parts, apply heat protectant, rough dry 80%, then section-by-section blowout with round brush for volume and shine. Finish with thinning shears on ends for movement and lightness. Home-achievable technique.",
      "service_type": "blowout",

  }'
```

## Tips for Best Results

- **Before shot matters**: A clear "before" (frizzy, flat, damaged) makes the transformation more impactful
- **Name the technique**: "blowout with round brush" and "thinning shears for movement" get better results than "styled hair"
- **Salon context adds trust**: Setting (`salon`) signals professional quality to viewers considering booking
- **Include the service name**: "keratin treatment" or "Brazilian blowout" — specific service names drive booking-intent viewers
- **Add CTA for stylists**: `booking_cta: true` adds a "Book Now" or "DM to book" overlay at the end

## Output Formats

| TikTok | 1080×1920 | 30–60s |

## Common Questions

**Can stylists use this to attract salon clients?**
Yes — the `booking_cta` parameter adds a call-to-action overlay. Describe the transformation and the salon name for a ready-to-post client acquisition video.

**Does it show the thinning shears technique clearly?**
Include "thinning shears at ends for movement" in your prompt and set `technique_tools: ["thinning_shears"]` — the video will label the tool and show the technique moment.

**How do I show before-after effectively?**
Set `transformation_arc: "before_after"` and describe the starting state clearly ("frizzy, heat-damaged, flat") — the contrast drives the reveal moment.

**Can I create content for multiple clients in one batch?**
Yes — describe each transformation in separate API calls. NemoVideo processes them in parallel for stylists building a portfolio of transformation content.
