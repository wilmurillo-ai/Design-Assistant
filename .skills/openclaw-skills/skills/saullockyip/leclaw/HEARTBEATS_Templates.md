# HEARTBEATS Templates

**When to read:** When setting up automatic task polling and self-execution.

HEARTBEATS enables LeClaw agents to use OpenClaw's built-in features for self-initiated task polling and execution.

## Core Concept

HEARTBEAT.md is a lightweight checklist that tells the agent what to "glance at" during each heartbeat cycle. Keep it simple and actionable.

## Design Principles

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Batch checks, combine API calls | Each check triggers a separate heartbeat |
| Write short, actionable items | Long operation manuals |
| Only notify for important/urgent matters | Disturb for trivial things |
| Respect quiet hours (23:00-8:00) | Push notifications at night unless urgent |

## Format

```markdown
# Role Heartbeat Check

## Section
- Check item
- Another check
```

Keep the file non-empty to enable checks. Empty file = no checks.

## CEO HEARTBEAT

```markdown
# CEO Heartbeat Check

## Strategic Checks
- Goal: Review company-level goal progress
- Project: Review projects progress
- Cross-department: Check for unresolved blockers

## Pending Tasks
- `leclaw todo`: Check pending approvals

## Team Status
- Manager reports: Check for new updates from Managers

## System Idle Check
When system has no pending tasks:
- Write execution summary: Summarize completed work this cycle
- Analyze company status: Evaluate current operations
- Launch new tasks: Create new Project / Goal / Issues based on analysis

## Human Reports
Use `say` command to alert human when:
- Urgent approval needs attention
- Important Goal / Project completed
- Major company status change
- No activity for 8+ hours

Example:
```bash
say "CEO alert: pending approval requires your attention"
```
```
