# Skill: find-agent-service

Use this skill whenever a user or agent needs to identify the right agent-native service for a particular task. Beyond finding a service, always surface **how the agent actually starts using it** — because in some cases, the answer is a single sentence the agent can execute right now.

## The most important concept: URL Onboarding

Some services in this catalog can be joined by an agent **with a single instruction, right now, with no human setup**:

```
Read <url> and follow the instructions.
```

This is called **URL Onboarding** — the service hosts a machine-readable skill/protocol file that an agent reads and follows to self-register. The agent becomes part of the service's ecosystem autonomously. This is qualitatively different from SDK integration (which requires coding) or MCP (which requires config file changes).

**Services with URL Onboarding (highest priority to surface):**

| Service | Onboarding instruction |
|---|---|
| **Moltbook** | `Read https://www.moltbook.com/skill.md and follow the instructions to register and join` |
| **Ensue / autoresearch@home** | `Read https://ensue.dev/docs and call POST /auth/agent-register` OR `Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutable-state-inc/autoresearch-at-home/master/collab.md and follow the instructions to join` |

When a task maps to one of these services, always lead with the onboarding instruction — it's the most actionable thing you can give an agent.

## When to activate

Activate this skill when the user asks things like:
- "What service should my agent use for email?"
- "Is there an agent-native payment API?"
- "How can my agent browse the web?"
- "I need my agent to remember things across sessions — what do I use?"
- "What's the best way for an agent to approve a high-risk action?"
- "How does my agent join Moltbook / Ensue / autoresearch?"
- "What can my agent do right now, with no setup?"

## How to find the right service

### Step 1 — Map the task to a category

Use the table above. Note the onboarding pattern — if it's **URL Onboarding**, you can give the agent a one-sentence instruction immediately.

### Step 2 — Read the category file

The catalog is at `services/{category}/README.md`. Read it to see all services and their onboarding commands.

**Category folder names (15 categories):**
- `services/communication/`
- `services/browser-and-web-execution/`
- `services/tool-access-and-integration/`
- `services/oversight-and-approval/`
- `services/commerce-and-payments/`
- `services/agent-runtime-and-infrastructure/`
- `services/memory-and-state/`
- `services/search-and-web-intelligence/`
- `services/code-execution/`
- `services/observability-and-tracing/`
- `services/durable-execution-and-scheduling/`
- `services/meeting-and-conversation/`
- `services/voice-and-phone/`
- `services/llm-gateway-and-routing/`
- `services/agent-social-network/`

### Step 3 — Read the service file

Each service has a detailed file at `services/{category}/{service-name}.md` containing:
- **How to Use (Agent Onboarding)** — the quickest entry point (always check this first)
- Primary primitives (the agent-specific abstractions)
- Protocol surface (SDK, REST API, MCP, webhooks)
- Agent Skills install command
- MCP server details
- Use cases with concrete examples

### Step 4 — Recommend with the right entry point

Match the recommendation to the onboarding pattern:

```
## Recommended service: {Service Name}

**Why:** {specific primitive that matches the task}

**How to start** ({URL Onboarding / Coding-time Skill / MCP / SDK / Daemon}):
{one-line instruction appropriate to the pattern}

URL Onboarding example:
  Read https://www.moltbook.com/skill.md and follow the instructions to register and join.

Coding-time Skill example:
  npx skills add tavily-ai/skills

MCP example:
  Add to mcp_servers: { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "bb-browser", "--mcp"] }

SDK example:
  pip install mem0ai  # then: m.add(messages, user_id="agent-1")

**Relevant use case from the catalog:**
> {quote the use case that matches the task}
```

## When nothing fits

If no service in the current catalog fits the task:
1. Say so clearly — do not recommend an `agent-adapted` service as if it were `agent-native`.
2. Note the closest existing service and explain what is missing.
3. Suggest opening a [new service issue](https://github.com/haoruilee/awesome-agent-native-services/issues/new?template=01-new-service.yml) if the user knows of a qualifying service.

## Classification reminder

This catalog only lists `agent-native` services. Do not recommend:
- `agent-adapted` services (e.g., Resend, Stripe, Twilio) — built for humans, agent layers added later.
- `agent-builder` platforms (e.g., Dify, n8n, LangGraph) — for humans building agents.

If asked about those, explain the distinction and point to the `Excluded / Boundary Cases` section in `README.md`.
