# Less Token

Save 40-65% tokens on summarization tasks. Compress verbose natural language prompts into structured one-line instructions that any AI understands.

**This skill is a text-to-text translator only.** It does not access files, fetch URLs, execute commands, or call external services. It only converts your summarization prompts into compressed syntax.

## What You Get

1. **40-65% fewer tokens** — Compress long summarization prompts into one-line instructions.
2. **Same result** — AI produces identical output from the compressed instruction.
3. **Cross-platform** — Compressed instructions work on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, 豆包, 元宝.
4. **No install** — No CLI, no brew, no npm, no binary, no API key. Copy, paste, done.

## How to Use

1. Copy the full protocol text from this skill page
2. Paste it into any AI conversation
3. AI responds — ready to compress


### Quick Test

After pasting, try:

- "Compress this: Please summarize the key points from this document in 3 professional bullet points"
- AI returns: `[SUM|sty=bullets,cnt=3,ton=pro]=>[OUT]`
- 70% fewer tokens. Same result.

## Compression Templates

| What you want | Verbose prompt | Compressed |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Short summary | "Give me a brief summary of the main points" | `[SUM\|len=short]=>[OUT]` |
| 3 bullet points | "Summarize in 3 concise bullet points" | `[SUM\|sty=bullets,cnt=3]=>[OUT]` |
| Professional report | "Create a professional executive summary in Markdown" | `[SUM\|ton=pro,sty=executive,fmt=md]=>[OUT]` |
| Key findings only | "Extract only the key findings and important data" | `[SUM\|key=findings]=>[OUT]` |
| Summarize + translate | "Summarize then translate to Chinese" | `[SUM\|len=short]=>[TRANSLATE\|lang=zh]=>[OUT]` |
| Compare + summarize | "Compare these two and summarize the differences" | `[CMP]=>[DIFF]=>[SUM\|sty=bullets]=>[OUT]` |
| Reformat summary | "Summarize as bullet points in Markdown" | `[SUM\|sty=bullets]=>[FMT\|fmt=md]=>[OUT]` |

## Before & After
