## Marketing Materials

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> ClawMeter is a self-hosted cost tracking dashboard for OpenClaw. It parses your session logs, calculates exact API costs per model and session, and sends budget alerts when you exceed thresholds. No cloud dependencies, 100% open source, runs on localhost.

### Key Selling Points

1. **Zero setup complexity** — Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
2. **Real-time visibility** — Auto-ingests logs as they're written
3. **Accurate pricing** — Built-in database for all major providers
4. **Budget protection** — Alerts before you overspend
5. **Self-hosted** — Your data never leaves your machine
6. **Free forever** — MIT license, no upsells

### Use Cases

- **Solo developers** — Keep personal projects within budget
- **Teams** — Allocate costs to projects or clients
- **Researchers** — Track experiment costs
- **Production apps** — Monitor live spending in real-time

### Testimonials (to collect)

Encourage early users to share feedback:

> "ClawMeter saved me from a $500 surprise bill. I was using Opus for everything without realizing it."

> "Finally I can see which models are actually cost-effective for my use case."
