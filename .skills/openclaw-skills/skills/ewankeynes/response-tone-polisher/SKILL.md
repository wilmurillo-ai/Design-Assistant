# Response Tone Polisher

Polishes response letters to peer reviewers by softening harsh or defensive language while preserving the author's position and scientific integrity.

## Overview

This skill analyzes author draft responses to reviewer comments and transforms confrontational or defensive phrasing into professional, diplomatic academic language. It helps researchers maintain positive relationships with reviewers while standing firm on scientifically justified positions.

## Key Features

- **Tone Analysis**: Identifies defensive, confrontational, or overly direct language
- **Polite Transformation**: Converts harsh statements into courteous academic prose
- **Position Preservation**: Maintains the author's scientific stance while improving delivery
- **Context Awareness**: Adapts based on response type (acceptance, partial acceptance, respectful decline)
- **Academic Expression Library**: Built-in collection of polished academic phrasings

## When to Use

- Before submitting response letters to journal editors
- When reviewer feedback triggers emotional or defensive reactions
- For authors whose first language is not English
- When revising rejected manuscripts for resubmission
- To ensure diplomatic handling of disagreements with reviewers

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```
Input:
Reviewer: The sample size is too small for meaningful conclusions.
Draft Response: I disagree. Our sample size is standard in this field.

Output:
We appreciate the reviewer's concern regarding sample size. While we acknowledge 
that larger samples provide greater statistical power, our sample size is consistent 
with established conventions in this field and meets the requirements for adequate 
power analysis (as detailed in the Methods section).
```

### Defensive Language Transformation

| Original (Defensive) | Polished (Professional) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "I will not change this." | "We have carefully considered this suggestion and respectfully maintain our original approach because..." |
| "The reviewer is wrong." | "We respectfully offer a different interpretation..." |
| "This is unnecessary." | "We appreciate this suggestion; however, we believe the current presentation adequately addresses this point." |
| "We already explained this." | "We have expanded our explanation to enhance clarity (Page X, Lines Y-Z)." |
| "That's not our fault." | "We acknowledge this limitation and have added appropriate caveats to the Discussion." |

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `reviewer_comment` | str | Yes | The reviewer's original comment or criticism |
| `draft_response` | str | Yes | Author's initial draft response (may contain harsh/defensive language) |
| `response_type` | str | No | One of: `accept`, `partial`, `decline` (default: auto-detect) |
| `polish_level` | str | No | `light`, `moderate`, `heavy` (default: moderate) |
| `preserve_meaning` | bool | No | Ensure scientific position is preserved (default: true) |

## Output Format

```json
{
  "polished_response": "string",
  "original_tone_score": "float (0-1, higher = more defensive)",
  "improvements": [
    {
      "original_phrase": "string",
      "polished_phrase": "string",
      "issue_type": "string"
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": ["string"],
  "politeness_score": "float (0-1)"
}
```

## Tone Patterns Detected

The skill identifies and transforms:

### 1. Direct Refusals
- "No" / "We won't" → "We respectfully decline to..."
- "We can't" → "We are unable to..."

### 2. Defensive Statements
- "But we already..." → "We have now clarified..."
- "This is not correct" → "We respectfully note that..."

### 3. Blame Shifting
- "The reviewer misunderstood" → "We apologize for the lack of clarity; we have revised..."
- "This is standard" → "This approach aligns with established conventions..."

### 4. Emotional Language
- "Unfortunately" (overused) → [removed or softened]
- "Obviously" → [removed]
- "Clearly" → [removed or context-dependent]

## Polite Academic Expressions

### Acknowledging Reviewers
- "We thank the reviewer for this insightful observation."
- "We appreciate the reviewer's careful attention to this detail."
- "We are grateful for this constructive feedback."
- "This is an excellent point."

### Expressing Disagreement Diplomatically
- "We respectfully offer an alternative interpretation..."
- "Upon careful reconsideration, we believe..."
- "While we appreciate this perspective, we note that..."
- "We respectfully maintain our position that..."

### Explaining Limitations
- "We acknowledge this limitation and have addressed it by..."
- "This constraint reflects the trade-off between..."
- "We have added appropriate caveats regarding this limitation."

### Describing Changes
- "We have revised the manuscript to clarify..."
- "We have expanded the relevant section to include..."
- "We have incorporated this suggestion by..."

## Workflow

1. **Input Analysis**: Parse reviewer comment and draft response
2. **Tone Assessment**: Score defensiveness and identify problematic phrases
3. **Pattern Matching**: Find harsh expressions in the transformation library
4. **Reconstruction**: Rewrite maintaining scientific accuracy
5. **Quality Check**: Verify politeness and clarity

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode
python scripts/main.py --interactive

# File-based
python scripts/main.py \
  --reviewer-comment "comment.txt" \
  --draft-response "draft.txt" \
  --output "polished.txt"

# Direct input
python scripts/main.py \
  --reviewer "The data is insufficient." \
  --draft "You are wrong. We have enough data." \
  --polish-level heavy
```

## Python API

```python
from scripts.main import TonePolisher

polisher = TonePolisher()
result = polisher.polish(
    reviewer_comment="The methodology is flawed.",
    draft_response="No it's not. We did it right.",
    response_type="decline",
    polish_level="moderate"
)

print(result["polished_response"])
```

## Limitations

- Does not verify scientific accuracy of responses
- Requires human review for complex nuanced disagreements
- May over-soften; authors should verify position is still clear
- Best for English-language responses

## Quality Checklist

After polishing, verify:
- [ ] Original scientific position is preserved
- [ ] No confrontational language remains
- [ ] Professional tone throughout
- [ ] Clear acknowledgment of reviewer's effort
- [ ] Specific changes are still referenced
- [ ] Response directly addresses the comment
