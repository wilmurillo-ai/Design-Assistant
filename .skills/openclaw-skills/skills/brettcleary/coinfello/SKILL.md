# CoinFello CLI Skill

Use the `npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest` CLI to interact with CoinFello. The CLI handles smart account creation, SIWE authentication, delegation management, prompt-based transactions, and transaction status checks.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later (npx is included with Node.js)

The CLI is available via `npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest`. No manual build step is required.

## Environment Variables

| Variable             | Required | Default                      | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COINFELLO_BASE_URL` | No       | `https://app.coinfello.com/` | Base URL for the CoinFello API                                                     |
| `RPC_BASE_URL`       | No       | —                            | QuickNode RPC base URL (e.g. `https://your-endpoint-name`)                         |
| `RPC_API_KEY`        | No       | —                            | QuickNode API key                                                                  |
| `RPC_URL_OVERRIDE`   | No       | —                            | Custom RPC URL override for development/testing (overrides all other RPC settings) |

If both `RPC_BASE_URL` and `RPC_API_KEY` are set, the CLI routes RPC requests through QuickNode for supported chains (Ethereum, Optimism, BSC, Polygon, Mantle, Base, Arbitrum, Linea, Sepolia, Base Sepolia). If either is missing or the chain is not supported, it falls back to the chain's default public RPC.

Set `RPC_URL_OVERRIDE` (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8545`) to route all RPC calls through a custom URL, regardless of chain or other RPC settings.

## Security Notice

This skill performs the following sensitive operations:

- **Key generation and storage**: By default, `create_account` generates a hardware-backed P256 key in the **macOS Secure Enclave** (or TPM 2.0 where available). The private key never leaves the hardware and cannot be exported — only public key coordinates and a key tag are saved to `~/.clawdbot/skills/coinfello/config.json`. If hardware key support is not available, the CLI warns and falls back to a software private key. You can also explicitly opt into a plaintext software key by passing `--use-unsafe-private-key`, which stores a raw private key in the config file — **this is intended only for development and testing**.
- **Signer daemon**: Running `signer-daemon start` authenticates once via Touch ID / password and caches the authorization. All subsequent signing operations reuse this cached context, eliminating repeated auth prompts. The daemon communicates over a user-scoped Unix domain socket with restricted permissions (`0600`). If the daemon is not running, signing operations fall back to direct execution (prompting Touch ID each time).
- **Session token storage**: Running `sign_in` stores a SIWE session token in the same config file.
- **Delegation signing**: Running `send_prompt` may receive a delegation request from the server, which is saved to a local file. Running `approve_delegation_request` creates and signs the delegation, then submits it to the CoinFello API.

Users should ensure they trust the CoinFello API endpoint configured via `COINFELLO_BASE_URL` before running delegation flows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start the signing daemon (optional, but avoids repeated Touch ID prompts)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest signer-daemon start

# 2. Create a smart account (uses Secure Enclave by default)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest create_account

# 3. Sign in to CoinFello with your smart account (SIWE)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest sign_in

# 4. Send a natural language prompt — if a delegation is needed, it will be saved for review
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest send_prompt "send 5 USDC to 0xRecipient..."

# 5. Approve the delegation request (if one was saved by send_prompt)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest approve_delegation_request
```

## Commands

### create_account

Creates a MetaMask Hybrid smart account. By default, the signing key is generated in the **macOS Secure Enclave** (hardware-backed, non-exportable). If Secure Enclave is unavailable, the CLI warns and falls back to a software key. Pass `--use-unsafe-private-key` to explicitly use a plaintext software key (development/testing only).

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest create_account [--use-unsafe-private-key]
```

- **Default (Secure Enclave)**: Generates a P256 key in hardware; saves `key_tag`, `public_key_x`, `public_key_y`, `key_id`, and `smart_account_address` to `~/.clawdbot/skills/coinfello/config.json`. The private key never leaves the Secure Enclave.
- **`--use-unsafe-private-key`**: Generates a random secp256k1 private key and stores it **in plaintext** in the config file. Use only for development and testing.
- Must be run before `send_prompt`

### get_account

Displays the current smart account address from local config.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest get_account
```

- Prints the stored `smart_account_address`
- Exits with an error if no account has been created yet

### sign_in

Authenticates with CoinFello using Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) and your smart account. Saves the session token to local config.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest sign_in
```

- Signs in using the private key stored in config
- Saves the session token to `~/.clawdbot/skills/coinfello/config.json`
- The session token is loaded automatically for subsequent `send_prompt` calls
- Must be run after `create_account` and before `send_prompt` for authenticated flows

### set_delegation

Stores a signed parent delegation (JSON) in local config.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest set_delegation '<delegation-json>'
```

- `<delegation-json>` — A JSON string representing a `Delegation` object from MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit

### new_chat

Clears the saved chat session ID from local config so the next `send_prompt` starts a fresh conversation.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest new_chat
```

- Removes `chat_id` from `~/.clawdbot/skills/coinfello/config.json`
- Use this when you want to reset conversation context (for example, after context-window errors)

### signer-daemon

Manages the Secure Enclave signing daemon. Starting the daemon authenticates once via Touch ID / password and caches the authorization, so subsequent signing operations (account creation, sign-in, delegation signing) do not prompt again.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest signer-daemon start    # Start daemon (one-time auth)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest signer-daemon status   # Check if daemon is running
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest signer-daemon stop     # Stop the daemon
```

- If the daemon is not running, all Secure Enclave operations fall back to direct execution (prompting Touch ID each time)
- The daemon is optional — all commands work without it

### send_prompt

Sends a natural language prompt to CoinFello. If the server requires a delegation to execute the action, the CLI saves the delegation request to a local file and logs the details to the terminal for review. The delegation is **not** signed automatically — you must explicitly approve it with `approve_delegation_request`.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest send_prompt "<prompt>"
```

Note that if you receive
`Failed to send prompt: Conversation request failed (400): {"error":"Your input exceeds the context window of this model. Please adjust your input or start a new chat and try again."}`
then you should call `npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest new_chat` to start a new chat with a new context window.

**What happens internally:**

1. Fetches available agents from `/api/v1/automation/coinfello-agents` and sends the prompt to CoinFello's conversation endpoint
2. If the server returns a read-only response (no `clientToolCalls` and no `txn_id`) → prints the response text and exits
3. If the server returns a `txn_id` directly with no tool calls → prints it and exits
4. If the server sends an `ask_for_delegation` client tool call with a `chainId` and `scope`:
   - Saves the delegation request (scope, chain ID, call ID, chat ID) to `~/.clawdbot/skills/coinfello/pending_delegation.json`
   - Logs a human-readable summary of the delegation request to the terminal
   - Exits without signing — run `approve_delegation_request` to approve

### approve_delegation_request

Approves and signs a pending delegation request saved by `send_prompt`, then submits it to CoinFello.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest approve_delegation_request
```

**What happens internally:**

1. Reads the pending delegation from `~/.clawdbot/skills/coinfello/pending_delegation.json`
2. Fetches CoinFello's delegate address
3. Rebuilds the smart account using the chain ID from the delegation request
4. Parses the scope and creates a subdelegation (wraps with ERC-6492 signature if the smart account is not yet deployed on-chain)
5. Sends the signed delegation back as a `clientToolCallResponse` along with the `chatId` and `callId`
6. Clears the pending delegation file
7. Returns a `txn_id` for tracking

## Common Workflows

### Basic: Send a Prompt (Server-Driven Delegation)

```bash
# Start the signing daemon (optional, reduces Touch ID prompts)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest signer-daemon start

# Create account if not already done (uses Secure Enclave by default)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest create_account

# Sign in (required for delegation flows)
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest sign_in

# Send a natural language prompt — if a delegation is needed, it will be saved for review
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest send_prompt "send 5 USDC to 0xRecipient..."

# Review the delegation request logged to the terminal, then approve it
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest approve_delegation_request
```

### Read-Only Prompt

Some prompts don't require a transaction. The CLI detects this automatically and just prints the response.

```bash
npx @coinfello/agent-cli@latest send_prompt "what is the chain ID for Base?"
```

## Gas Cost Estimates

Actual on-chain gas costs vary by network. Do **not** assume mainnet Ethereum gas prices for L2 chains.

| Network | Swap / Transfer Gas Cost |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| Base    | $0.0003 – $0.0006        |

These are approximate ranges under normal network conditions. L2s like Base are significantly cheaper than Ethereum mainnet.

## Edge Cases

- **No smart account**: Run `create_account` before `send_prompt`. The CLI checks for a saved private key and address in config.
- **Not signed in**: Run `sign_in` before `send_prompt` if the server requires authentication.
- **Invalid chain name**: The CLI throws an error listing valid viem chain names.
- **Unsupported chain**: The CLI rejects chains where CoinFello infrastructure and MetaMask delegation contracts aren't available. Supported chains: Ethereum, OP Mainnet, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Mantle, Base, Arbitrum One, Linea, Sepolia, Base Sepolia. **Funding a smart account on any other chain will result in permanently locked funds.**
- **Read-only response**: If the server returns a text response with no transaction, the CLI prints it and exits without creating a delegation.
