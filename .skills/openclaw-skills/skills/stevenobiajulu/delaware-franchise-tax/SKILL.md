# Delaware Franchise Tax

File your Delaware annual franchise tax and annual report.

> **Interactivity note**: Always ask the user for missing inputs.
> If your agent has an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.),
> prefer it — structured questions are easier for users to answer.
> Otherwise, ask in natural language.

## Security model

- This skill **does not** download or execute any code.
- All portal interactions are performed by the user, guided step-by-step by the agent.
- If the user opts in to browser automation (Playwright via CDP), the agent may assist with portal navigation — but credit card and banking details must **always** be entered by the user directly.

## When to Use

- Annually before **March 1** (C-Corps) or **June 1** (LLCs/LPs/GPs)
- When your registered agent sends a reminder
- When you receive a notice from the Delaware Division of Corporations
- **Portal hours**: 8:00am-11:45pm ET only
- **Scam warning**: Delaware warns about deceptive solicitations. Legitimate notices come from the state or your registered agent only. Discard anything that asks you to pay through a non-official channel.

## Phase 1: Gather Information

Ask the user for the following (use `AskUserQuestion` if available):

**All entity types:**
- Entity type: **C-Corp** or **LLC/LP/GP**
- Delaware Business Entity File Number (up to 9 digits)
- Registered agent name

**For C-Corps, also ask:**
- Total authorized shares by class and par value (e.g., 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.00001 par value)
- Total issued and outstanding shares as of December 31 of the tax year
- Total gross assets as of December 31 (from Form 1120 Schedule L, Line 15 — or estimated from bank balance + investments + receivables)
- Nature of business (brief description of how the company generates revenue)

**Officers and directors (C-Corps):**
- Officers: names, titles, addresses
- Directors: names, addresses

## Phase 2: Calculate Tax

### LLCs/LPs/GPs

Flat **$300** annual tax. No calculation needed. Skip to Phase 3.

### C-Corps — Calculate Both Methods

Always calculate both methods and recommend the lower one. Show all intermediate values so the user can verify.

#### Method 1: Authorized Shares Method

```
Shares <= 5,000:        $175 (minimum)
5,001 - 10,000:         $250
Each additional 10,000: +$85
Maximum:                $200,000
```

**Example**: 10,000,000 authorized shares
- First 10,000 shares: $250
- Remaining 9,990,000 shares = 999 increments of 10,000: 999 x $85 = $84,915
- Total: $250 + $84,915 = **$85,165**

#### Method 2: Assumed Par Value Capital (APVC) Method

Almost always cheaper for startups. Requires a gross assets figure.

```
Step 1: Assumed Par = Total Gross Assets / Total Issued Shares
Step 2: For each class of shares where assumed par >= stated par:
        use assumed par x number of authorized shares in that class
Step 3: For each class of shares where assumed par < stated par:
        use stated par x number of authorized shares in that class
Step 4: Sum all classes = Assumed Par Value Capital (APVC)
Step 5: Tax = (APVC rounded up to next $1,000,000 / $1,000,000) x $400
Step 6: Minimum tax: $400
Step 7: Maximum tax: $200,000
```

**Example**: 10,000,000 authorized shares at $0.00001 par, 1,000,000 issued, $50,000 gross assets
- Step 1: Assumed Par = $50,000 / 1,000,000 = $0.05
- Step 2: $0.05 >= $0.00001, so use assumed par: $0.05 x 10,000,000 = $500,000
- Step 4: APVC = $500,000
- Step 5: Round up to $1,000,000 -> 1 x $400 = **$400**

#### Filing Fee

- **$50** for non-exempt domestic corporations
- **$25** for 501(c)(3) exempt corporations

**Total due = franchise tax + filing fee**

Present both calculations to the user:
```
Method 1 (Authorized Shares): $XX,XXX
Method 2 (Assumed Par Value):  $XXX
Recommended method:            Method 2
Filing fee:                    $50
Total due:                     $XXX + $50 = $XXX
```

## Phase 3: File via Portal

The agent can automate the portal using Playwright if Chrome is running with remote debugging enabled. Otherwise, guide the user step-by-step.

### Automation Setup (Playwright via CDP)

If the user says "use playwright", "use the browser" or requests similar automation:

1. **Launch Chrome with remote debugging** (see `reference/ecorp-portal-playwright-notes.md` for commands)
2. **Connect via Playwright** (see reference for CDP connection snippet)
3. **Portal field reference**: See `reference/ecorp-portal-playwright-notes.md` for:
   - All field selector IDs
   - Date field workaround (must use JS `el.value =` not Playwright `.fill()`)
   - State dropdown abbreviations (use `value="NY"` not `label="New York"`)
   - Director name fields (separate first/middle/last fields, NOT one name field)
   - APVC activation sequence
   - Session/eId behavior

### Filing Steps

1. **Navigate**: Open https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/logintax.aspx
2. **Login**: Enter Business Entity File Number. Solve CAPTCHA (if the user shares a screenshot, the agent can try to read it). Click **Continue**.
3. **Entity verification**: Confirm entity name, registered agent, and registered office match your records.
4. **Fill form fields** (all on one page):
   - **Stock info**: Issued shares (per-class field, NOT the readonly total), gross assets, asset date (must == fiscal year end)
   - **Address**: Principal business address with state abbreviation
   - **Nature of business**: Select from dropdown (e.g., "Technology/Software")
   - **Officer**: First/middle/last name, title, address
   - **Directors**: Set total count, click "Enter Directors Info", fill first/middle/last name + address for each
   - **Authorization**: First/middle/last name, title, address
   - **T&C checkbox**: Must check `chkCertify` before continuing
5. **Recalculate tax**: Click "Recalculate Tax" button. Verify the displayed tax matches your calculation from Phase 2. If it still shows the Authorized Shares method amount, the asset date is probably wrong — fix it via JavaScript.
6. **Review**: Click "Continue Filing" to see the Review Copy. Verify all data.
7. **Payment**: Click "Proceed to Payment". The agent **must stop here** — credit card and banking details must be entered by the user. If tax exceeds $5,000, ACH payment is required.
8. **Confirmation**: After payment:
   - Click **"Display Confirmation Copy"** (`onclick="downloadConfirmation();return false;"`) to save receipt PDF
   - Click **"Email Confirmation Copy"** to email the filed report (opens popup at `Email.aspx`, enter email address)
   - **CRITICAL**: "Once you leave this screen, you will no longer be able to obtain a confirmation copy" — save/email before navigating away
   - Record the Service Request Number from the URL: `srNo=XXXXX`

## Phase 4: Save Receipt and Remind

### Save the confirmation PDF

The downloaded confirmation PDF **is** the filing record — no need to create a separate one.

The portal downloads the receipt as `Ecorp_Confirmation_<ServiceRequestNumber>.pdf` to the default Downloads folder. Move it to a durable location:
- `~/Documents/Tax/Delaware/<EntityName>/` on local disk
- A "Tax" or "Corporate Records" folder in cloud storage if available
- Keep the original filename — it contains the Service Request Number for future reference

```bash
# Example
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Tax/Delaware/My-Corp-Name
mv ~/Downloads/Ecorp_Confirmation_*.pdf ~/Documents/Tax/Delaware/My-Corp-Name/
```

Ask the user where they keep tax records and move the file there.

### Set a reminder

Remind the user to set an annual reminder for approximately 2 weeks before the deadline:
- **Mid-February** for corporations (March 1 deadline)
- **Mid-May** for LLCs/LPs/GPs (June 1 deadline)

**Scheduling options:**
- **Claude Cowork**: `/schedule` for recurring tasks
- **Claude Code CLI**: external scheduler (cron, LaunchAgent)
- **Any calendar app**: set a recurring annual reminder
- If `~~calendar` MCP is available, create the reminder directly

## Notes

- This skill does not provide tax advice — consult a tax professional for your specific situation.
- The Delaware Division of Corporations portal is the only official filing method.
- Late filing incurs a **$200 penalty + 1.5% monthly interest**.
- If franchise tax exceeds **$5,000**, ACH payment is required (credit cards not accepted above this threshold).
- **Large Corporate Filers** (listed on a national stock exchange with $750M+ in revenue or assets) pay a flat **$250,000**.
