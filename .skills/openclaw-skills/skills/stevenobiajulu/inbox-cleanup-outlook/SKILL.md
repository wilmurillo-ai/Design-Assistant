# Inbox Cleanup & Rules (Outlook)

This skill covers both one-time inbox cleanup and ongoing rule automation for Microsoft 365 / Outlook. The workflow uses the Microsoft Graph API for folder management and server-side inbox rules.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user's inbox has become noisy — automated notifications drowning out human conversations, newsletters mixed with client emails, or hundreds of unread messages that make it hard to find what matters.

**Real trigger example**: A user's partner email went unread for 9 days because it was buried under GitHub and npm notifications. This is the exact problem server-side rules solve.

## Trust Boundary: What This Skill Can and Cannot Enforce

Before you install or grant OAuth consent, understand where the safety boundary lies.

**This skill is instruction-only.** It ships no code, executes nothing by itself, and cannot enforce any of the safety protections described below. Everything in the "Rule Security Model" and "Authentication & Required Scopes" sections is enforced (or not enforced) by whichever runtime actually executes the Microsoft Graph API calls. The skill file is a set of instructions, not a sandbox.

### What that means in practice

- The blocked-actions list (`forwardTo`, `redirectTo`, `delete`, etc.) describes what a trusted runtime SHOULD reject. Whether those actions are actually rejected depends on the runtime. If you use [`email-agent-mcp`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp), rejection is built into the action handler ([`rules.ts:39`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp/blob/main/packages/email-core/src/actions/rules.ts#L39)). If you use a raw Graph API client or a custom MCP without equivalent guards, the protections do not automatically apply.
- `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` is a high-risk scope because it controls inbox rules — and inbox rules can be configured to forward or redirect mail externally. Granting the scope without a runtime that enforces the blocked-actions list gives up the primary mitigation.
- Autonomous invocation (where the agent runs this skill without per-call approval) is a platform-level setting, not something the skill controls. Combined with write scopes, it increases the surface area of any runtime weakness.

### Before installing or granting consent

This skill requests a high-risk mailbox-rule permission (`MailboxSettings.ReadWrite`). Review the five items below before you grant consent. They are the exact things to check; the skill cannot enforce any of them for you.

1. **Only grant `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` if you trust the runtime** that will execute these instructions. The skill itself cannot enforce the blocked-actions list (`forwardTo`, `forwardAsAttachmentTo`, `redirectTo`, `delete`, `permanentDelete`). Verify your runtime does.
2. **Prefer audit-only scopes** (`MailboxSettings.Read`) — or omit rule creation entirely — if you do not need automated rule management. Folder operations and batch moves work with just `Mail.ReadWrite`.
3. **If you must grant full scopes, use a vetted runtime** that enforces blocking of forward/redirect/delete actions at the action handler. The reference runtime `email-agent-mcp` does this at [`rules.ts:39`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp/blob/main/packages/email-core/src/actions/rules.ts#L39) — inspect the code yourself. Alternatively, add network-level protections (for example, NemoClaw) to block Graph endpoints that create dangerous rules.
4. **Test on a non-production account first.** Be prepared to revoke OAuth consent and invalidate refresh tokens at https://myaccount.microsoft.com/consent if anything looks wrong or misconfigured.
5. **Avoid enabling autonomous invocation** for this skill unless you understand and trust the runtime's guardrails. Autonomous invocation combined with `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` gives the agent the ability to create inbox rules without per-call user approval — only safe if the runtime enforces the blocked-actions list.

## Authentication & Required Scopes

This skill operates against Microsoft Graph and requires an OAuth 2.0 delegated access token for a Microsoft 365 account.

### Minimum scopes by use case

| Use case | Scopes required |
|----------|----------------|
| Audit existing folders and inbox rules (read-only) | `Mail.Read`, `MailboxSettings.Read`, `offline_access` |
| Create folders and move existing email | + `Mail.ReadWrite` |
| Create and delete server-side inbox rules | + `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` |

This skill does **not** require `Mail.Send` — inbox cleanup never sends email.

### Token storage

The reference runtime stores OAuth tokens in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux libsecret) via MSAL with `@azure/identity-cache-persistence`. No raw passwords. No plain text token files. Refresh tokens are handled silently by MSAL.

### Risk mapping — scopes to exfiltration risk

| Scope | Enables | Risk if misused |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `Mail.Read` | Read any message, folder, and attachment | Read-only; no exfiltration beyond the agent session |
| `Mail.ReadWrite` | Create folders, move/copy messages | Low on its own — no outbound mail capability |
| `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` | Create and delete inbox rules | **HIGH** — malicious rules with `forwardTo`/`redirectTo` can exfiltrate mail silently even after the session ends |
| `offline_access` | Refresh tokens without re-auth | Low on its own; extends the blast radius of any other scope if the token is stolen |

`MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` is the only HIGH-risk scope this skill needs. It is mitigated by the reference runtime's hard block on dangerous rule actions (see "Rule Security Model" below).

### Reference runtime guardrails

This skill is instruction-only — it cannot enforce any guardrails by itself. The protections below are provided by the **runtime** that actually executes the Graph API calls, not by this skill.

If you use [`email-agent-mcp`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp) as the runtime, it blocks dangerous inbox rule actions at the action handler level — `forwardTo`, `forwardAsAttachmentTo`, `redirectTo`, `delete`, `permanentDelete` — and rejects any rule creation attempt that includes them. Source: [`packages/email-core/src/actions/rules.ts:39`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp/blob/main/packages/email-core/src/actions/rules.ts#L39).

If you use a different runtime (raw Graph API client, custom MCP server), these protections are NOT automatically present. You should either layer NemoClaw network policy, restrict OAuth scopes, or use a runtime that provides equivalent guardrails.

### Hardening recipes

1. **Audit mode only** — grant `MailboxSettings.Read` (without `.ReadWrite`) if you want the agent to review existing rules without being able to create or modify them. The cleanup workflow below will still work for folder management.
2. **Don't grant `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite`** if you don't need automated rule creation. Folder management and batch moves work with just `Mail.ReadWrite`.
3. **Layer NemoClaw** — see the [NemoClaw Email Policy skill](https://clawhub.ai/skill/nemoclaw-email-policy) to block dangerous Graph endpoints at the network layer regardless of scope grants.

## The Cleanup Workflow

This workflow was battle-tested on a 2,500+ email cleanup. Follow the steps in order.

### Step 1 — Scan Before Creating Folders

Don't guess what folders to create. Let the data tell you.

Fetch the last 200 inbox emails and count by sender address:

```
GET /me/messages?$top=200&$select=from,receivedDateTime&$orderby=receivedDateTime desc
```

Group by `from.emailAddress.address`, sort by count descending. The top automated senders are the ones to filter.

**MCP**: Use `list_emails(max_results=200, fields=["fromAddress", "receivedDateTime"])` and count programmatically.

### Step 2 — Categorize by Action Required

Don't organize by sender type (that is arbitrary). Organize by what the user needs to do:

| Category | Action | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Glance, don't act** | Skim the subject line, archive | GitHub CI, Azure DevOps builds, npm advisories, DMARC reports |
| **Read when time allows** | Set aside for a slow moment | Newsletters, marketing from known vendors |
| **Archive for records** | Keep but don't read now | Receipts, invoices, payment confirmations |
| **May need action** | Review and decide | Meeting bookings, compliance alerts, security notifications |
| **Default: don't filter** | Leave in inbox | Human conversations (colleagues, clients, partners) |

The last row is important: human conversations stay in inbox unless the user specifically requests otherwise. The goal is to remove noise, not to hide signal.

### Step 3 — Create Folders

Keep it to 5-9 folders. More than that and the user stops checking them. The right test: "Would I check this folder at least weekly?" If no, it should be a subfolder or merged into a broader category.

**REST API**:
```
POST /me/mailFolders
{"displayName": "Dev Notifications"}
```

**MCP**: `create_folder("Dev Notifications")`

### Step 4 — Batch-Move Existing Email

Rules only apply to future mail. After creating folders, move all existing matching emails.

**REST API**:
```
GET /me/messages?$filter=from/emailAddress/address eq 'notifications@github.com'&$top=50
```
Then for each message:
```
POST /me/messages/{id}/move
{"destinationId": "<folder-id>"}
```

Paginate with `@odata.nextLink` — some senders will have hundreds of messages. Process 50 at a time.

**MCP**: `move_to_folder(email_id, "Dev Notifications")` handles ID resolution. Loop through search results.

### Step 5 — Create Server-Side Rules

Server-side rules run on Microsoft's servers — they work 24/7, even when no agent is running.

**REST API**:
```
POST /me/mailFolders/inbox/messageRules
{
  "displayName": "GitHub to Dev Notifications",
  "sequence": 1,
  "isEnabled": true,
  "conditions": {
    "fromAddresses": [
      {"emailAddress": {"address": "notifications@github.com"}}
    ]
  },
  "actions": {
    "moveToFolder": "<folder-id>",
    "stopProcessingRules": true
  }
}
```

**MCP**: `create_inbox_rule({displayName: "GitHub to Dev Notifications", conditions: {fromAddresses: [{email: "notifications@github.com"}]}, actions: {moveToFolder: "<folder-id>", markAsRead: true}})`

### Step 6 — Re-Sweep After Rule Creation

Rules and email arrival can race. After creating rules, wait a few minutes, then re-run the batch move from Step 4 to catch any emails that arrived between rule creation and activation.

## Rule Ordering

The `sequence` field controls which rules fire first. Lower sequence = higher priority.

**This matters because**: A generic "any `noreply@` sender goes to Newsletters" rule will swallow meeting booking notifications from `noreply@notifications.hubspot.com` if it fires first.

**Fix**: Create specific rules with lower sequence numbers before broad rules.

```
sequence 1: HubSpot meeting bookings → Meetings folder
sequence 2: noreply@ senders → Newsletters folder
```

Always set `stopProcessingRules: true` on each rule to prevent cascade.

## Rule Security Model

Not all rule actions are safe. Agents should never create rules with the actions listed below. This skill is instruction-only — it cannot enforce these restrictions itself. The agent's runtime is what actually makes (or blocks) the API calls.

If your runtime is [`email-agent-mcp`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp), it rejects rule creation attempts that include any of these actions and returns a `BLOCKED_ACTION` error. Source: [`rules.ts:39`](https://github.com/UseJunior/email-agent-mcp/blob/main/packages/email-core/src/actions/rules.ts#L39). If you use a different runtime, you should verify it provides equivalent enforcement, or layer network-level controls (e.g. NemoClaw).

**Block these actions:**

| Action | Risk |
|--------|------|
| `forwardTo` | Could exfiltrate email to external addresses |
| `forwardAsAttachmentTo` | Same risk |
| `redirectTo` | Same risk |
| `delete` | Data loss |
| `permanentDelete` | Irreversible data loss |

**These actions are safe:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `moveToFolder` | Move to a folder ID |
| `copyToFolder` | Copy to a folder ID |
| `markAsRead` | Mark as read |
| `markImportance` | Set importance level (low/normal/high) |
| `stopProcessingRules` | Prevent later rules from firing |

If the user asks for a forwarding rule, ask them to confirm the destination address explicitly before creating it.

## Common Conditions

| Condition | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| `fromAddresses` | Exact sender match: `[{emailAddress: {address: "..."}}]` |
| `subjectContains` | Words in subject: `["[npm]", "advisory"]` |
| `senderContains` | Partial sender match: `["github.com"]` |
| `headerContains` | Match email headers |

## Graph API Gotchas

These are production-discovered issues — not theoretical:

1. **`$select` on PATCH = 400** — `$select` does not work on PATCH requests. Returns "OData request not supported." Only use `$select` on GET.

2. **Move is POST, not PATCH** — `POST /me/messages/{id}/move` with `{"destinationId": "<id>"}`.

3. **`$filter` with sender address** — `$filter=from/emailAddress/address eq '...'` works reliably. URL-encode the filter value.

4. **Uppercase in storage** — Outlook uppercases `senderContains` values (e.g., `NOTIFICATIONS@GITHUB.COM`). This is cosmetic — matching is case-insensitive.

5. **Root-only folder listing** — `GET /me/mailFolders?$top=100` returns only root-level folders. Child folders require `/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders`.

6. **Pagination** — Large mailboxes can have hundreds of folders. Always check for and follow `@odata.nextLink`.

## Verification

After creating rules:

1. `GET /me/mailFolders/inbox/messageRules` — verify the rule exists and is enabled
2. Check `hasError` field — if `true`, the rule has a configuration issue
3. Send a test email matching the rule conditions and verify it lands in the correct folder
