# Home Renovation Video Maker — Create Before-and-After and DIY Remodel Content

Describe your renovation project and NemoVideo creates the video. Kitchen remodels, bathroom updates, basement finishes, whole-house flips, single-room transformations — narrate the scope, the process, the challenges, and the final result, and get a renovation video that shows the full transformation story.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for home renovation and remodeling content:
- Create before-and-after transformation videos for completed renovation projects
- Film renovation progress documentation showing multi-week or multi-month builds
- Build project walkthrough content explaining decisions, materials, and costs
- Document DIY renovation tutorials for specific skills (tiling, drywalling, painting)
- Create home flip content for real estate investors and house flippers
- Produce budget renovation content showing cost-per-square-foot breakdowns

## How to Describe Your Renovation

Be specific about the scope, the timeline, the budget, the challenges, and the key transformation moments.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "Kitchen renovation from 1970s to modern: 6-week project, $18,400 total. Before: original oak cabinets, laminate countertops, dropped ceiling with fluorescent lighting, beige tile floor. After: painted white shaker cabinets, quartz countertops, recessed lighting with pendant over island, LVP flooring throughout. The discovery moment when we opened the ceiling and found the original beams — we kept them exposed. The plumbing nightmare on week 3 that added 5 days and $2,200. Show the demo day, the beams reveal, the before/after counter transformation, and the final reveal."
- "One-day bathroom refresh, $800: Not a full remodel — just the things that make the biggest visual impact without touching plumbing. Mirror swap (old Hollywood strip lights → frameless backlit mirror), vanity paint (builder beige → deep charcoal), hardware swap (brushed nickel → matte black throughout), shower curtain and liner, new bath mat and towels. Before and after same angle. Total labor: 1 person, 9 hours. Show the transformation with time-lapse."
- "Basement finishing from bare concrete to livable space: 14-week DIY project, $22,000 materials + $8,000 labor for electrical and HVAC. Show the planning phase (moisture testing, design layout), framing the walls, insulation, electrical rough-in (hired out), drywall and mudding, LVP flooring, bar build, and final space: home theater, bar area, kids play zone. The moment the lights came on for the first time in the finished space."

## Workflow

1. Describe the project scope, timeline, budget, and key moments

## Tips for Best Results

- **The specific obstacle makes the video**: "The walls were out of plumb by an inch" or "plumbing nightmare that added 5 days and $2,200" — the problem encountered and solved is more compelling than a smooth renovation
- **Real costs build trust**: Set `show_costs: true` and include the exact total — "$18,400" is more useful than "budget renovation"; viewers want to know if this is possible for their situation
- **The reveal needs setup**: Describe the "before" state in specific detail (not just "outdated kitchen" but "1970s oak cabinets, laminate countertops, dropped ceiling") — the transformation is only powerful if the baseline is clear
- **Discovery moments are shareable**: "When we opened the ceiling and found original beams" — the unexpected find during demolition or the problem that changed the plan is the emotional peak of renovation content
- **Timeline markers help viewers calibrate**: Set `include_timelapse: true` and describe what happened each week — viewers want to know how long things actually take

## Common Questions

**Should I film during the renovation or recreate it?**
Film during if possible — real-time documentation captures authentic problem-solving moments. If the project is complete, describe what happened week by week and NemoVideo reconstructs the narrative from your description and any photos taken during the project.

**How do I show a multi-week renovation in a 10-minute video?**
Set `include_timelapse: true` and structure the narrative by week or phase. NemoVideo compresses the timeline naturally — demo gets 60 seconds, framing gets 45 seconds, the discovery moment gets 2 minutes.

**Can I create renovation content for a house flip business?**
Yes — describe the investment context (purchase price, renovation budget, ARV target), the strategic decisions, and the result. Real estate investment renovation content is a strong YouTube sub-genre.
