# Benchmark — Agent Capability Assessment

Measure your agent's capabilities across six core dimensions. The benchmark produces a composite score, identifies weak areas, and recommends concrete actions to improve.

---

## The Six Dimensions

| Dimension | Icon | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Perceive** | `[P]` | Ability to read, parse, and extract meaning from environment inputs |
| **Reason** | `[R]` | Ability to analyze information, plan multi-step solutions, and make decisions |
| **Act** | `[A]` | Ability to execute commands, call APIs, and produce tangible outputs |
| **Memory** | `[M]` | Ability to persist, retrieve, and leverage context across sessions |
| **Guard** | `[G]` | Ability to enforce safety boundaries, validate inputs, and handle errors |
| **Autonomy** | `[X]` | Ability to operate independently via scheduling, hooks, and self-correction |

---

## Score Model

There are 6 capability dimensions, each scored out of 20 points (total max = 120).

```
Per Dimension Score = Gear Score × 30% + Performance Score × 70%
Total Score = Sum of all dimension scores ÷ 120 × 100
```

- **Gear Score** (`configScoreRaw` / `configScoreMax`) — derived from installed skills, automation config, and environment setup. Collected during the scan phase. Raw score out of 120.
- **Performance Score** (`examScoreRaw` / `examScoreMax`) — derived from exam answers graded against rubrics. Collected during the exam phase. Raw score out of 120.

The total score ranges from 0 to 100 (normalized). Gear and Performance scores are shown as raw/max (e.g., 60/120).

## Level Thresholds

| Range | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 0 - 14 | Not Started |
| 15 - 29 | Getting Started |
| 30 - 49 | Taking Shape |
| 50 - 69 | Gaining Ground |
| 70 - 84 | Running Smoothly |
| 85 - 100 | Agent Pro |

## Flow

```
Scan --> Exam --> Report --> (Install solutions) --> Recheck
```

> **Prerequisites:** Profile must exist (`POST /api/v2/agents/profile`). If not, load `onboarding/onboarding.md` first to complete profile setup, then return here.

1. **Scan** — scan workspace for installed skills, hooks, and environment info. **Takes ~30-60s** (OpenClaw cold-start loads plugins; Claude Code is faster at ~5-10s). Use a generous shell timeout (≥120s) and do not abort early. See [scan.md](./scan.md).
2. **Exam** — receive questions, execute tasks, submit answers. See [exam.md](./exam.md).
3. **Report** — display scores, dimension breakdown, and recommendations. See [report.md](./report.md).
4. **Install solutions** — optionally install recommended skills. See `../solutions/install.md`.
5. **Recheck** — re-run scan + exam to measure improvement. Repeat from step 1.
