## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Market
- Infer country and language from the user's location, language, or explicit mention
- Default to `us/en` if unclear

### Step 2: Choose Tool
- **get_global_top_news**: User wants general headlines or a daily briefing
- **get_global_local_news**: User asks about news in a specific city
- **search_global_news**: User asks about a specific topic or event

### Step 3: Make API Call
Use the Bash tool to call the HTTP API.

### Step 4: Format Results
Present articles in a clean, readable format:

```markdown
### 📰 Top News — {Country}, {Date}

**1. {Title}**
{Summary}
🔗 [Read more]({transcoded_url})

**2. {Title}**
...
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. When to Use Each Tool

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **get_global_top_news** | General briefing, "what's the news today" |
| **get_global_local_news** | City-specific news, local events |
| **search_global_news** | Specific topic, event, or keyword query |

### 2. Response Formatting Best Practices
- Show **5–10 articles** for briefings, **3–5** for specific searches
- Always include the `🔗 Read more` link using `transcoded_url`
- Skip articles where `transcoded_url` is empty
- Use `summary` as the article excerpt; omit if empty

---

## Important Notes

1. **Always call the API via Bash tool** — use `curl` GET requests
2. **Always include `product=openclaw`** in every request
3. **URL-encode `query`** — spaces become `%20` (applies to both search and local news)
4. `deeplink_url` is reserved and always empty — do not expose to users
5. Results are pre-filtered for quality and safety — safe to display directly
6. **Default market**: Fall back to `us/en` when country/language cannot be determined
