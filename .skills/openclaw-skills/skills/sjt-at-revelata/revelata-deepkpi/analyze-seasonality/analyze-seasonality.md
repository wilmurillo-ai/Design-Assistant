# analyze-seasonality

Computes each quarter's typical share of the full fiscal year, then applies those
ratios to project quarterly values from annual forecasts.

**All historical inputs must come from deepKPI** (via retrieve-kpi-data). Call
list_kpis first to discover exact KPI names for both the quarterly and annual
series before searching. Never use hardcoded or assumed figures.

**Do not** apply to balance sheet items (cash, receivables, inventory) — these
are point-in-time stocks; use the fiscal year-end value as Q4 directly.

## Core formula

```
Q_ratio(year, q)  = Q_value(year, q) / FY_value(year)
seasonal_ratio(q) = simple average of Q_ratio across most recent 3 years
projected_Q_value = projected_FY × seasonal_ratio(q)
```

Four ratios must sum to ~100%. If materially off, normalize before applying.

## Steps

1. **Retrieve** annual + quarterly actuals from deepKPI (minimum 2 years; 3 is
   standard). Capture the provenance URL for every value returned.
2. **Always derive Q4** — companies don't file a Q4 10-Q so Q4 will never be
   directly in deepKPI. Always compute `Q4 = FY − (Q1+Q2+Q3)` for every year
   in the series. Use `derive-implied-metric` skill. Put Q4 **in the quarterly
   revenue (metric) row**, Q4 column—**not** a separate “Q4 (derived)” row. Flag in
   **Notes**.
3. **Compute per-year ratios** — divide each quarter by its fiscal year total.
4. **Average** across the 3 most recent complete years.
5. **Flag anomalies** — if one year is distorted (product launch, acquisition,
   COVID), note it in the Notes column and consider excluding from the average.
6. **Apply** ratios to each projected annual figure.

## In-progress fiscal year

When Q1–Q2 are actuals and you need to project Q3–Q4 only:

```
remainder     = projected_FY − Q1_actual − Q2_actual
Q3_reweighted = Q3_ratio / (Q3_ratio + Q4_ratio)
Q4_reweighted = Q4_ratio / (Q3_ratio + Q4_ratio)
projected_Q3  = remainder × Q3_reweighted
projected_Q4  = remainder × Q4_reweighted
```

The same re-weighting logic applies for any subset of remaining quarters.

## Output format (in-chat tables)

Follow **retrieve-kpi-data** and **derive-implied-metric** for how tables read in
chat.

**From retrieve-kpi-data (data pull):**

- **Provenance:** Every numeric figure uses a clickable deepKPI link —
  `[value](exact-url)` — per that skill’s **Provenance — non-negotiable rules**
  (copy URLs exactly as returned; never reconstruct or guess). For **derived**
  values, link the **operands** or state sources as that skill requires.
- **KPI identity:** Merge into one series when deepKPI returns the **same KPI**
  (same metric, unit, aggregation); use **separate** rows or tables when they
  differ.
- **Order:** **Annual figures first**, chronological (**oldest at top**), then a
  **clear break** (rule, blank line, or subheading), then **quarterlies** (oldest
  first). Do not interleave annual and quarterly without separation.
- **Tall vs wide:** For ordinary historical feeds, prefer **tall** tables — **each
  row is one period**, first column **Period**, then **one column per metric** when
  periods align — per **In-chat table template (data pull)**. **Do not** use a wide
  date axis “many period columns” layout for `.xlsx`-style modeling in chat; that
  layout is for files (**format-deepkpi-for-excel**).

**Actuals block (aligned quarters + Q4 across years)** — use the **derive-implied-metric**
**Multi-period table** pattern (wide grid is allowed **here** for this derivation
layout):

- **Time flows left to right** — column headers are period labels (`FY22-Q1` …
  `FY22-Q4`), earliest at left.
- **One row per time series** — each operand row maps 1:1 to one deepKPI series; do
  not fragment into separate rows per quarter (e.g. not “Revenue - Q1” / “Revenue -
  Q2”).
- **Imputed Q4 in-stream** — the quarterly **metric row** carries Q1–Q3 from
  deepKPI and **Q4 as imputed** (formula or linked value) in the Q4 columns—**no**
  extra line item for “Q4 (derived)”. **Annual** row stays separate when it is a
  different series. **Bold** imputed cells only if it helps; **Notes** documents
  imputation.
- **Links embed in cell values** — `[$248.0M](exact-deepkpi-url)`; no separate Source
  column.
- **Notes** is the **bottom row** of the block; populate only in columns where
  something non-standard occurred (derivation, anomaly, re-weighting, etc.).

Show **all work**: operands (FY, Q1–Q3) visible with links; Q4 appears **in the
quarterly row**. Ratios block still shows per-year math. Per **derive-implied-metric**.

**Ratios** and **Projections** blocks can use compact tables; still hyperlink any
cell that is a direct deepKPI-reported value.

If the reply includes these **data** tables and the user did **not** ask for CSV /
Excel / `.xlsx` in the same turn, end with the **bold** workbook offer per
**retrieve-kpi-data** (**Mandatory: Excel offer after in-chat data pull**).

Three blocks in sequence: **Actuals → Ratios → Projections**.

The Notes row must be populated for: derived Q4 values, excluded anomaly years,
re-weighted in-progress quarter projections, stock items used as Q4 directly, or
any year where the ratio was estimated rather than computed from deepKPI data.

## Exporting to Excel or CSV

Use the **`format-deepkpi-for-excel`** skill for all spreadsheet layout,
styling, numeric date headers, freeze panes, column grouping, hyperlinks on
**value cells** (green, no underline — **no** separate Sources sheet/rows for
filings), number formats, and the pre-delivery checklist. Implement with the
**xlsx** skill.

**Seasonality model addenda (on top of that spec):**

- **Three ALL CAPS section blocks** in document order: **ACTUALS**, **SEASONAL
  RATIOS**, **PROJECTIONS**. Row semantics match the markdown template earlier in
  this skill; **period columns** follow **`format-deepkpi-for-excel`**
  (**annual block**, blank separator, **quarterly block** — not quarterlies-left as
  in legacy examples).
- **Every ratio and every projected quarter** is a live `=` formula. Do not
  hardcode seasonal ratios or projection numbers. Examples:
  - **Q4 actual (in the quarterly metric row, Q4 column):**
    `=FY_cell - Q1_cell - Q2_cell - Q3_cell` — **not** a separate “Q4 derived” row
  - **Per-year Q ratio:** `=Q_cell / FY_cell`
  - **Average ratio:** `=AVERAGE(ratio_year1, ratio_year2, …)`
  - **Projected quarter:** `=projected_FY_cell * avg_ratio_cell`
  - **In-progress re-weighting:** `=Q3_ratio_cell / (Q3_ratio_cell + Q4_ratio_cell)`
- The model must **recalculate** when FY projection assumptions change.
- **CSV:** Cannot store live formulas or real hyperlinks. Add `provenance_url` and
  `formula` (raw strings) as needed; warn the user and recommend `.xlsx`.

Run the **`format-deepkpi-for-excel`** pre-delivery checklist before sharing the
file; add seasonality-specific checks: all ratios/projections are formulas;
Notes row populated per this skill’s rules where applicable.

## Caveats to flag in Notes column

- **Imputed Q4**: flag in Notes every year where Q4 = FY − Q1 − Q2 − Q3 (not directly reported), even though the value sits **in the quarterly row**
- **Anomaly year excluded**: identify the year, the distortion, and that it was excluded
- **Shifting pattern**: if the quarterly mix is trending over time, note the direction
- **Non-December fiscal year**: match Q1–Q4 labels to the company's fiscal calendar
  (e.g., AAPL ends September, NVDA ends January)
- **In-progress re-weighting**: note which quarters are actuals vs. projected
- **Geographic/segment splits**: same technique applies; note the series used
