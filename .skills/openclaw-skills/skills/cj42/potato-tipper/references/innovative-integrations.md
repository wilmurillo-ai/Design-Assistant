# Innovative integrations (expansion ideas)

These ideas build on the Tip-on-Follow pattern from `LEARN.md` and extend it toward broader protocol-level integrations.

## 1) Reward-on-Follow with different asset types

The current PotatoTipper is hardcoded to $POTATO (LSP7). The same architecture can be forked for:

- **Any LSP7 token**: Just change `_POTATO_TOKEN` constant to another token address and redeploy (also change the contract name from `PotatoTipper` to `{YourTokenName}Tipper` and any other variable name like `_POTATO_TOKEN` -> `_{YOURTOKENNAME}_TOKEN` for clean code).
- **LSP8 NFTs**: Replace `transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount, ...)` with `transfer(address from, address to, bytes32 tokenId, ...)`. This presents some additional challenges: 
  1. the `LSP8Tipper` contract must be authorized as an operator for any single token IDs to transfer. 
  2. selecting _which_ tokenId to send — store a queue of token IDs in the ERC725Y storage of the user's Universal Profile who is tipping, creating a new custom ERC725Y data key with its own LSP2 schema,
  3. or use a mint-on-demand pattern.
- **Native LYX**: More complex than operator-based LSP7 transfers. Requires the tipping contract to have one of the following permission set to spend LYX from the 🆙 (via LSP6 Key Manager):
  - `SUPER_TRANSFERVALUE` permission (can be dangerous as can transfer all the LYX of the user),
  - or `TRANSFER_VALUE` permission (with `AddressPermissions:AllowedCalls:<TipperContract>`) for better restriction of which address it is allowed to tip to only.

## 2) Tiered reward system

Extend the settings to support tiers:
- First 100 followers → tip 100 🥔 each
- Followers 101–500 → tip 42 🥔 each
- Followers 500+ → tip 10 🥔 each

Implementation: store tiers as an array in ERC725Y under a new data key, or encode them in a more complex settings struct.

## 3) Conditional NFT badge minting

Instead of (or in addition to) tipping tokens, mint an "Early Follower" LSP8 NFT to the first N followers. Creates a provable on-chain record of early supporters.

```
When someone follows → check follower count of the followed UP
  → if < 100 followers total → mint "Early Supporter" badge NFT to new follower
  → else → tip standard 🥔 amount
```

## 4) Cross-protocol composability (read settings from other contracts)

Any protocol can read a user's PotatoTipper settings using `loadTipSettingsRaw` + `decodeTipSettings` (see `solidity-examples.md`). Use cases:

- **Leaderboard protocol**: rank users by their tip generosity (tip amount × follower count)
- **Reputation system**: users with active PotatoTipper + high tip amounts get a "generous" reputation score
- **Airdrop eligibility**: include users who have actively tipped > X 🥔 total as airdrop recipients
- **Social graph analytics**: combine PotatoTipper activity with LSP26 follower data for on-chain social metrics

## 5) Multi-action delegate (react to follow with multiple actions)

Instead of a single LSP1 delegate, build a "router" delegate that:
1. Tips 🥔 tokens (calls PotatoTipper)
2. Mints an NFT badge
3. Sends a "welcome" notification to the follower
4. Updates an on-chain counter

This could be a generic "Follow Action Router" that lets users configure multiple post-follow actions via ERC725Y data keys.

## 6) Subscription / recurring tips

Extend the concept beyond one-time tips:
- A user opts into a "subscription" mode where they tip a follower periodically (e.g., monthly) as long as the follower remains following.
- Requires a keeper/automation system to trigger periodic checks.

## 7) Gamification / social challenges

- "Follow race" — first 10 followers of a new UP get 10x tips
- "Referral bonus" — if your follower gets 5 followers of their own, you get bonus 🥔
- "Streak rewards" — followers who remain for 30+ days get an extra tip

## 8) PotatoTipper as a marketing primitive

For brands on LUKSO:
- A brand creates a UP + connects PotatoTipper with their own branded token
- "Follow us and get 50 $BRAND tokens"
- All on-chain, verifiable, censorship-resistant marketing spend
- Historical record of early brand supporters, permanently on-chain
