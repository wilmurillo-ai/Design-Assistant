description: OpenAI Codex-native multi-agent swarm orchestration for parallel coding. Use when spawning multiple Codex CLI agents to work in parallel with git worktrees, tmux tracking, endorsement gates, native code review, integration merging, and webhook notifications. All agents are Codex (o3 for architect/integrator/reviewer, codex-mini for builders). Triggers on parallel coding, multi-agent work, swarm orchestration, or batch spawning with OpenAI models.

# Codex Swarm — Multi-Agent Orchestration

Parallel Codex agents: plan → endorse → spawn → monitor → review → integrate → ship.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Write task prompts
cat > /tmp/prompt-task1.md << 'EOF'
Implement feature X...
EOF

# 2. Create tasks JSON
cat > /tmp/tasks.json << 'EOF'
[
  {"id": "feat-x", "description": "/tmp/prompt-task1.md", "role": "builder"},
  {"id": "feat-y", "description": "/tmp/prompt-task2.md", "role": "builder"}
]
EOF

# 3. Spawn batch
bash scripts/spawn-batch.sh "/path/to/project" "batch-1" "Description" /tmp/tasks.json
```

## Roles & Models

| Role | Model | Reasoning | Use |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|
| architect | o3 | high | Design, planning, complex decisions |
| builder | codex-mini | medium | Feature implementation (parallel) |
| reviewer | o3 | medium | Auto-review via `codex exec review` |
| integrator | o3 | high | Cross-branch merge + conflict resolution |

## Key Codex Features Used

- `codex exec --full-auto` — non-interactive sandboxed execution
- `codex exec review` — **native code review** (replaces custom reviewer)
- `-c model=o3` — deep reasoning model for complex tasks
- `-c model_reasoning_effort=high` — maximum reasoning depth

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `spawn-batch.sh` | Spawn N parallel agents + integration watcher |
| `spawn-agent.sh` | Spawn single agent (manual worktree + tmux + codex exec) |
| `endorse-task.sh` | Endorse task before spawn |
| `check-agents.sh` | Show running agent status |
| `cleanup.sh` | Remove worktrees, branches, sessions |
| `notify.sh` | Webhook/Telegram notification |
| `notify-on-complete.sh` | Auto-watcher with native `codex exec review` |
| `integration-watcher.sh` | Auto-merge when batch completes |

## Setup

1. Copy `scripts/` and `config/` to your workspace
2. Configure `config/swarm.conf` (copy from `.example`)
3. Required: `bash 4+`, `tmux`, `git`, `gh`, `jq`, `codex` (Codex CLI)
