**Subteams:** claude-swarm-handoff claude-swarm-inbox claude-swarm-escalation claude-swarm-decisions claude-swarm-planformat
**Result:** All 5 branches merged. One merge conflict in spawn-agent.sh (handoff vs decisions) resolved — kept both decision template and handoff format. Fixed stale summary->handoff reference. All 8 scripts pass bash -n syntax check. No remaining issues.

### Update: 2026-03-28 11:26
### Integration Review — 2026-03-28 11:26
**Subteams:** claude-swarm-statemachine claude-swarm-maxconcurrent
**Result:** Both branches merged cleanly with no conflicts. No cross-team issues: statemachine (update-task-status, notify-on-complete, pulse-check) and maxconcurrent (spawn-batch, queue-watcher, integration-watcher) modify disjoint files. All 17 scripts pass bash -n. Session naming conventions are consistent across both subteams. State machine transitions are guarded with [[ -x ]] so they degrade gracefully.

### Update: 2026-03-28 11:44
### claude-swarm-cleanup — 2026-03-28 11:44
Review passed — reviewer exited cleanly (auto-pass: clean exit, no issues indicated)

Review passed — reviewer exited cleanly (auto-pass: clean exit, no issues indicated)

### Update: 2026-03-28 11:50
### Integration Review — 2026-03-28 11:50
**Subteams:** claude-swarm-standup claude-swarm-cleanup
**Result:** Both branches merged cleanly with no conflicts. Scripts are fully disjoint (daily-standup.sh vs cleanup.sh). Shared state (active-tasks.json) is accessed on non-overlapping data ranges. All 20 scripts pass bash -n. No duplicate code, no API breaks, no config conflicts.
