# JumpServer Skills

`jumpserver-skills` is a skill repository for JumpServer V4.10 that focuses on query workflows, audit investigation, and template-based usage reports. It is designed for object lookup, permission readback, audit investigation, governance inspection, access analysis, and bastion usage reports for a specific day or time range. It is closer to a reusable skill package with formal entrypoints than to a CLI tutorial that expects users to manually compose script commands.

Inside the repository, requests are automatically routed to three formal entrypoints: `jms_query.py`, `jms_diagnose.py`, and `jms_report.py`. The repository stays read-only by default, only allowing local runtime writes to `.env` and the current organization context, and it does not perform JumpServer business write operations.

## Quick Start

1. Connect this skill to your agent or Codex environment. The repository file [agents/openai.yaml](./agents/openai.yaml) can be used directly as the integration description.
2. Initialize the configuration in natural language, for example: "Help me generate `.env`. My JumpServer URL is `https://jump.example.com`, and I log in with AK/SK."
3. Then continue with direct requests such as "Which assets can this user access?" or "Show me yesterday's usage."

For first-time use, the natural-language `.env` generation path is usually the fastest option.

## What This Skill Can Do

| Capability Group | Suitable Requests | Entrypoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Object queries | queries for assets, accounts, users, user groups, orgs, platforms, nodes, labels, and domains | `jms_query.py` | Best for exact object lists or reading a single object in detail |
| Permission relationships | permission rules, ACL, RBAC, who can access an asset, details of a permission rule | `jms_query.py` | Read and explain only; no permission writes |
| Audit investigation | login, session, command, file transfer, abnormal behavior, high-risk commands, failed login investigations | `jms_query.py` | Best for logs, records, details, and event-level requests |
| Configuration and diagnostics | config checks, connectivity, org switching, object resolution, license, system settings, storage, tickets | `jms_diagnose.py` | Best for preflight, environment confirmation, and governance prerequisites |
| Governance inspection | asset governance, account governance, access analysis, system inspection, capability-based aggregate analysis | `jms_diagnose.py` | Prefer capability aggregation instead of forcing users to stitch together scattered queries |
| Usage reports | daily reports, usage situation, usage analysis, what happened on a day, rankings or overviews for a time range | `jms_report.py` | These requests produce a complete HTML report instead of a one-line summary |

## How To Use This Skill

1. Prepare the environment file. Create `.env` in the repository root. There are two ways to do it:

Manual method:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Conversation method:

If local configuration is incomplete, the runtime can also generate `.env` directly through natural-language conversation. It collects `JMS_API_URL`, authentication mode, organization, timeout, and TLS settings in a fixed order, then writes the local `.env` after showing a masked summary. For example:

- "Help me generate `.env`. My JumpServer URL is `https://jump.example.com`, and I log in with AK/SK."
- "Help me initialize JumpServer config. I log in with username and password, and I do not want certificate verification."

2. Connect this skill to your agent or Codex environment. The repository file [agents/openai.yaml](./agents/openai.yaml) provides a ready-to-use skill integration description and can serve as one of the entrypoints for referencing or registering the skill.

3. Describe requests directly in natural language instead of manually assembling script commands. For example: "Which assets can this user access?", "Show me yesterday's usage", or "Show the details of this permission rule."

4. Add context based on the returned result. If the result shows `candidate_orgs`, `switchable_orgs`, candidate objects, or a missing time range, follow the prompt and provide the organization, object name, platform, or time window.

You do not need to remember specific execution commands. This skill performs preflight first, then routes to the formal entrypoint automatically, and prompts for organization, object, or time-range details only when needed.

## Environment Variables

The repository root provides [`.env.example`](./.env.example) as a template. In actual use, prepare the `.env` file in the repository root. You can copy the template and edit it, or create it manually by following the template.

If you do not want to edit it manually, you can also generate `.env` through natural-language conversation. When missing or incomplete configuration is detected, the skill collects the required fields in order and writes the configuration to the local `.env` through the formal entrypoint.

If you want to provide everything up front, these are usually enough:

- `JMS_API_URL`
- one complete credential pair: `JMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/JMS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` or `JMS_USERNAME/JMS_PASSWORD`
- `JMS_ORG_ID`, which can be left empty if you are not sure yet
- `JMS_TIMEOUT`, which falls back to the default if omitted
- `JMS_VERIFY_TLS`, which defaults to `false` if omitted

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `JMS_API_URL` | required | JumpServer API / access URL |
| `JMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | paired with `JMS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`, or use username/password instead | API Access Key ID |
| `JMS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` | paired with `JMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, or use username/password instead | API Access Key Secret |
| `JMS_USERNAME` | paired with `JMS_PASSWORD`, or use AK/SK instead | JumpServer login username |
| `JMS_PASSWORD` | paired with `JMS_USERNAME`, or use AK/SK instead | JumpServer login password |
| `JMS_ORG_ID` | optional during initialization | written before business execution through org selection or reserved-org rules |
| `JMS_TIMEOUT` | optional | request timeout in seconds |
| `JMS_VERIFY_TLS` | optional | whether to verify certificates, default `false` |

Environment variable rules:

- `JMS_API_URL` must be provided.
- At least one complete authentication pair must be provided: `JMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/JMS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` or `JMS_USERNAME/JMS_PASSWORD`.
- `.env` is loaded automatically by the runtime.
- If `.env` is missing or incomplete, you can fill it through natural-language conversation, and the runtime will generate or overwrite the local `.env` after confirmation.
- Before first use, make sure the URL, authentication method, organization, timeout, and TLS settings are complete.
- If you switch the JumpServer instance, account, organization, or `.env` content, rerun full preflight.

## Typical Request Examples

- "Show me the details for the user `Demo-User`."
- "Show me which assets are under the node named `Demo-Node`."
- "Show me which assets are available on the `Linux` platform."
- "Show me the details of this permission rule, and tell me which users and assets it affects."
- "Who can access this asset?"
- "Query the login audit for the last week."
- "Show me a user's session records and abnormal interruption details."
- "Help me investigate yesterday's high-risk commands and file-transfer audit."
- "Show me usage for a specific day."
- "Show me yesterday's login activity."
- "I want to know who logged in the most last week."
- "Check which assets were most active in early March."
- "Show me the detailed login logs for a specific day."
- "Export detailed command records for a specific day."

These boundaries are especially important:

- Expressions like `login status for a day`, `session overview for a day`, or `who had the most activity in a time range` belong to reports or usage analysis.
- Expressions like `login logs for a day`, `command records for a day`, or `details of a specific session` belong to audit investigation.

## Usage Reports and Time-Range Rules

As long as the core request is JumpServer usage-data analysis for a specific day or time range, the workflow prioritizes the template-based report flow. This includes:

- usage reports, daily reports, weekly reports, and monthly reports
- usage situation, usage analysis, usage statistics, usage summary, and usage overview
- audit analysis and "what happened on a day"
- login, session, command, or transfer activity for a specific day
- rankings, TOP lists, "who had the most", or "which assets were most active" for a time range

These requests generate a complete HTML report by default instead of falling back to a free-text summary first. Only when the user explicitly says "do not generate a report", "just analyze it", "give me a quick summary", "only give me the conclusion", or "do not use the template" may the workflow skip the template and return a short analysis.

Time expressions are normalized into explicit time windows first:

- "yesterday" -> previous day `00:00:00 ~ 23:59:59`
- `20260310` -> `2026-03-10 00:00:00 ~ 23:59:59`
- `2026-03-10` / `2026/03/10` / `March 10` style expressions -> that day `00:00:00 ~ 23:59:59`
- "last week" -> previous natural week, Monday `00:00:00 ~ Sunday 23:59:59`
- "this month" -> the first day of the current month `00:00:00` to the current date or month end `23:59:59`

Reports are always written to `reports/JumpServer-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. If the request includes command-audit fields, the report applies the predefined command-storage aggregation rules automatically, so users do not need to choose internal collection logic manually.

## Organization Selection and Blocking Rules

- When the user explicitly specifies an organization, execute in that organization.
- For report or usage-analysis requests with no specified organization, or when the user explicitly says "all organizations" or "global organization", default to trying the global organization `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` first.
- For ordinary query requests with no specified organization, the existing organization rules apply. If the organization cannot be determined safely, the result returns `candidate_orgs` and asks the user to choose one first.
- If the current organization is already active but other organizations can still be switched to, the result continues to return `switchable_orgs` so the user can continue in another organization.
- If the current organization is A and the target object is in B, the workflow does not continue automatically across organizations.

In the following cases, the skill blocks instead of continuing by guesswork:

- configuration or authentication is incomplete
- the organization is unclear and cannot be determined automatically
- the object name is duplicated or the platform is unclear
- query results cross organizations
- the global organization required by the report request is not accessible
- the user tries to bypass the formal entrypoint or skip preflight

## Unsupported Scope

- Creating, updating, deleting, or unlocking assets, platforms, nodes, accounts, users, user groups, or organizations.
- Creating, updating, appending, removing, or deleting permissions and their relationships.
- Running business actions while skipping preflight.
- Using temporary SDK or HTTP scripts to bypass the formal entrypoints.
- Bypassing the formal `jms_report.py` entrypoint for report requests and replacing it with ad hoc inline logic.
- Continuing execution by guessing when objects are unclear, organizations are unclear, or the request crosses organizations.
