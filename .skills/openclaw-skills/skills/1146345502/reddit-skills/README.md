# reddit-skills

Reddit automation Skills — directly uses your logged-in browser and real account, operating Reddit as an ordinary user.

Supports OpenClaw and all AI Agent platforms compatible with the `SKILL.md` format (e.g. Claude Code).

> **⚠️ Usage advice**: Although this project uses your real browser and account, you should still **control operation frequency** and avoid mass actions in a short time. Aggressive automation may trigger Reddit's rate limits or account restrictions.

## Features

| Skill | Description | Core Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **reddit-auth** | Authentication | Login check, session management |
| **reddit-publish** | Content Publishing | Text / link / image post submission |
| **reddit-explore** | Discovery | Search, subreddit browsing, post details, user profiles |
| **reddit-interact** | Social Interaction | Comment, reply, upvote, downvote, save |
| **reddit-content-ops** | Compound Ops | Subreddit analysis, trend tracking, engagement campaigns |

Supports **chained operations** — you can give compound natural-language instructions and the Agent will automatically chain multiple skills. For example:

> "Search r/Python for the most upvoted posts about FastAPI this week, save the top one, and tell me what it's about"

The Agent will execute: search → filter by top/week → save → get detail → summarize.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python >= 3.11
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
* Google Chrome browser

### Step 1: Install the project

**Option A: Download ZIP (recommended)**

Download from GitHub and extract to your Agent skills directory:

```
# OpenClaw
<openclaw-project>/skills/reddit-skills/

# Claude Code
<your-project>/.claude/skills/reddit-skills/
```

**Option B: Git Clone**

```bash
cd <your-agent-project>/skills/
git clone https://github.com/1146345502/reddit-skills.git
```

Then install Python dependencies:

```bash
cd reddit-skills
uv sync
```

### Step 2: Install the browser extension

The extension lets the AI operate Reddit in your browser using your real login session.

1. Open Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**, select this project's `extension/` directory
4. Confirm the **Reddit Bridge** extension is enabled

Once installed, you're ready to go — all actions happen in your own browser, using your real account.

## Usage

### As an AI Agent skill (recommended)

After installing to a skills directory, just talk to the Agent in natural language. It will route your intent to the right skill automatically.

**Authentication:**

> "Check if I'm logged in to Reddit" / "Log out of Reddit"

**Search & Browse:**

> "Search Reddit for posts about machine learning" / "Show me the top posts on r/Python"

**Submit content:**

> "Submit a text post to r/learnpython with this title and body..."

**Interact:**

> "Upvote this post" / "Comment on this post: Great write-up!" / "Save this post"

**Compound operations:**

> "Analyze the top posts in r/startups this month and summarize the common themes"

### As a CLI tool
