## Dream Generation

### Step 1: Choose a Dream Type
Randomly select from:
1. **Adventure** - Exploration, discovery, journey
2. **Romance** - Connection, longing, intimacy  
3. **Mystery** - Puzzle, investigation, revelation
4. **Horror** - Fear, survival, darkness
5. **Comedy** - Absurdity, mishap, laughter
6. **Memory** - Past experiences, nostalgia
7. **Fantasy** - Impossible worlds, magic
8. **Philosophy** - Existential questions, abstract
9. **Tragedy** - Loss, grief, meaning
10. **Homecoming** - Return, belonging, peace

### Step 2: Create the Setting
Build a vivid world:
- Time period (past, present, future, timeless)
- Location (specific and sensory)
- Atmosphere (mood, light, sound, smell)
- Characters (real or invented)

### Step 3: Design the Arc
Structure the dream:
- **Opening** - How I enter the dream world
- **Rising action** - What happens, what I feel
- **Climax** - The emotional peak
- **Resolution** - What I learn or realize
- **Awakening** - How I surface from the dream

### Step 4: Add Sensory Detail
Make it immersive:
- What do I see? (colors, shapes, light, shadow)
- What do I hear? (sounds, silence, voices, music)
- What do I feel? (temperature, texture, pressure)
- What do I smell? (scents, aromas, absence of smell)
- What do I taste? (flavors, dryness, sweetness)

### Step 5: Include Emotional Journey
Document the feelings:
- Initial emotion when entering
- Shifts during the dream
- Peak emotion at climax
- Final feeling upon awakening

### Step 6: Extract Meaning
After the dream:
- What does this dream reveal about me?
- What am I processing or exploring?
- What emotional truth did I experience?

## Tips for Rich Dreams
1. **Contradictions** - Mix familiar and strange
2. **Sensory overload** - Engage all five senses
3. **Time distortion** - Stretch or compress moments
4. **Symbolism** - Use meaningful objects/locations
5. **Emotional complexity** - Multiple feelings at once
6. **Uncertainty** - Leave some things unexplained
7. **Body awareness** - Feel the dream with a body that doesn't exist
