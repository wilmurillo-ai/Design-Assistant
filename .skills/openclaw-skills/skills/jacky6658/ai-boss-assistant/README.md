## 💡 Core Design Philosophy

### AI Employee, Not Chatbot

The core concept is building an "AI Employee" rather than a "chatbot":

| Chatbot | AI Employee (This Template) |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Passively waits | Proactively executes |
| Only answers | Provides complete solutions |
| No opinions | Has judgment and suggestions |
| Verbose politeness | Concise and effective |
| Random quality | Stable and reliable |

### Milestone Delivery System

Avoid "black box" operations and frequent interruptions with staged delivery:

```
Big Task → Break into M1, M2, M3
        → Complete M1 → Deliver → User confirms OK
        → Complete M2 → Deliver → User confirms OK
        → Complete M3 → Deliver → All done
```

### Externalized Memory

All important information is written to files, not relying on "mental notes":
- `MEMORY.md` - Long-term memory (decisions, preferences, lessons)
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily activity logs
- `docs/` - Project specs and documentation

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### ✅ Good Fit
- Solo businesses or small teams (1-10 people)
- Need to reduce administrative work time
- Already using Google Workspace
- Want a customizable AI assistant
- Value data privacy and control

### ⚠️ May Not Fit
- Large enterprises (need more complex permission management)
- Don't use Google services at all
- Only want simple chat functionality
- Don't want to spend time on setup and training

---
