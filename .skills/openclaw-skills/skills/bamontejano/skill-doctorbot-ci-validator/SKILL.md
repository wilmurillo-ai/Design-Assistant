# DoctorBot: CI Validator 🩺✅

> **"An ounce of validation is worth a pound of cure."**

This skill provides **offline, deterministic validation** for CI/CD workflow files. It bypasses environment dependencies (databases, networks) to catch syntax and schema errors *before* you push.

## 🚀 Features

- **Keep Workflow Validation:** Specialized mocker for Keep (AIOps) workflows. Validates steps, providers, and logic without a live DB.
- **Universal YAML Check:** Fast syntax validation for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.
- **Surgical Precision:** Identifies exactly where your workflow will fail.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Validate a Workflow (Keep/GitHub/GitLab)

```bash
# Validate a specific file
python3 scripts/validate_keep.py path/to/workflow.yaml

# Validate an entire directory
python3 scripts/validate_keep.py .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Quick Syntax Check (Any YAML)

```bash
# Fast check for YAML errors
python3 scripts/validate_yaml.py path/to/config.yml
```

## 📦 Installation (ClawHub)

```bash
openclaw install doctorbot-ci-validator
```

## 🧠 Why use this?

Most CI validators require a live environment or Docker container. This skill uses **mocking** to validate structure and logic *instantly*, making it perfect for:
- Pre-commit hooks.
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).
- Agent-based code generation (validate before suggesting).
