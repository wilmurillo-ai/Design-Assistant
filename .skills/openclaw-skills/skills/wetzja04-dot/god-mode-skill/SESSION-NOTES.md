### 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **US spellings** - "analyses" is correct plural (not "analyse")
2. **Compelling descriptions** - Short, punchy, benefit-first
3. **Test thoroughly** - Found 3 bugs through systematic testing
4. **Document everything** - TESTING.md was invaluable
5. **ClawHub publishing** - Straightforward once metadata is right

### 🤝 Collaboration Notes

**User (Caspar) feedback was key:**
- Q1-Q5 validation caught real issues
- "God's eye view" branding was perfect
- Insisted on clarity in description (made it much better)
