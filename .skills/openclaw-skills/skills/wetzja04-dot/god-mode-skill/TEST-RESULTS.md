## Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Azure DevOps Pagination Missing (Q3)

**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED in commit 2d08ded

**Problem:**
- Azure repos hitting exactly 100 commits (suspicious coincidence)
- Azure DevOps API uses pagination (`$top` and `$skip` parameters)
- Provider code made single request, missing subsequent pages

**Root Cause:**
```bash
# Old code - no pagination
_azure_api "GET" "$url" | jq '[.value[]? | {...}]'
```

**Fix:**
- Added pagination loops for commits (max 1000) and PRs (max 500)
- Uses `$top=100` and incremental `$skip` values
- Properly handles empty pages to detect end of results

**Verification:**
- ContentEngine: 64 → 68 commits (fetched additional page)
- Insights: 100 → 23 commits (corrected with date filtering)
- All Azure repos now fetch complete history within 90-day window

**Commit:** `2d08ded - fix: add pagination support for Azure DevOps commits and PRs`

### Bug #2: Status Display for Repos with Old Commits (Q2)

**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED in commit bc61b31

**Problem:**
- Repos with commits >7 days old show "No activity synced"
- Actual data exists in database, but not displayed
- Affected: earth-clock (10d), VideoAnnotator (36d), video-annotation-viewer (42d)

**Root Cause:**
```bash
# status.sh queries with 7-day filter
db_get_commit_stats() {
    local since=$(($(date +%s) - days * 86400))
    SELECT ... WHERE timestamp > $since
}
# Returns 0 commits + null timestamp when nothing in past 7 days
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Show last commit date even if >7 days: "Last: 10d ago • Update OpenGraph metadata"
- Weekly stats can still be 0: "This week: 0 commits"

**Fix Applied:**
1. ✅ Added `db_get_last_commit()` to query without date filter
2. ✅ Status overview shows last activity even if >7 days old
3. ✅ Detailed view shows recent commits from past 30 days when weekly is empty
4. ✅ Stale warnings (⚠️) now work correctly

**Commit:** `bc61b31 - fix: status display for old commits + PR/issue timestamp conversion`

---

### Bug #3: PR/Issue Timestamp Conversion

**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED in commit bc61b31

**Problem:**
- PRs and issues had NULL timestamps in database
- Schema expects INTEGER (Unix epoch) but code was storing ISO strings
- Monthly review couldn't filter PRs by date

**Root Cause:**
```bash
# sync.sh was directly inserting ISO timestamps
PR_CREATED=$(echo "$pr" | jq -r '.created_at')  # "2025-09-08T09:58:47Z"
db_exec "... VALUES (..., '$PR_CREATED', ...)"  # Wrong: string in INTEGER field
```

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Convert ISO to Unix timestamp before insert
if [[ "$PR_CREATED" =~ ^[0-9]{4}- ]]; then
    PR_CREATED=$(date -d "$PR_CREATED" +%s)  # 1757325527
fi
db_exec "... VALUES (..., $PR_CREATED, ...)"  # Correct: integer
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ PRs from github:InfantLab/brain properly timestamped
- ✅ PRs from video-annotation-viewer properly timestamped
- ✅ Monthly review can now filter by date (when implemented)

## Features Tested

### Core Features (v0.1.0)

#### ✅ Multi-Project Status
- **Test:** 15 projects (8 GitHub, 7 Azure DevOps)
- **Sorting:** Activity-based (most active first) ✅ validated by user
- **Display:** Relative timestamps, commit counts, PR/issue counts
- **Performance:** <5 seconds for 15 projects

#### ✅ Sync Command
- **Incremental sync:** Uses cache, only fetches new data
- **Force sync:** `--force` flag bypasses cache (90-day full refresh)
- **Multi-provider:** GitHub and Azure DevOps working side-by-side
- **Data quality:** 631 commits synced across 14 active projects

#### ✅ Agent Analysis (OpenClaw Mode)
- **Workflow:** Tool displays prompt → Agent provides JSON response
- **Analysis Quality:** Identified real production pain points (rate limiting, log paths)
- **User Validation:** "seems fine" (Q5)
- **Prompt Structure:** Complete AGENTS.md + commit patterns + pain points

#### ✅ Logs Command
- **Activity logging:** All operations logged with timestamps
- **Formats:** COMMAND, INFO, ERROR levels
- **Query:** Last N lines, follow mode, path display
- **Integrity:** No unexpected errors in 631-commit sync history

## Data Validation (User Confirmation)

### Q1: Current Week Activity ✅
**Data:** ContentEngine (31), brain (27), tada (23)  
**User:** "yes that looks good"  
**Result:** Activity sorting algorithm validated

### Q2: Inactive Repos ⚠️
**Data:** VideoAnnotator/earth-clock showing "No activity synced"  
**User:** "have been active in nov and dec less so in jan. earth-clock has activity this month"  
**Result:** Bug #2 discovered - display issue for old commits

### Q3: Azure 100-Commit Pattern 🐛
**Data:** Insights, ParentBench, prototypeAPI all exactly 100 commits  
**User:** "looks like suspicious coincidence - i think you're right this pagination issue"  
**Result:** Bug #1 discovered and fixed

### Q4: Open PRs ✅
**Data:** 3 open PRs in prototypeAPI  
**User:** "correct"  
**Result:** PR counting validated

### Q5: Agent Analysis Quality ✅

## Performance Metrics

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| `god status` (15 projects) | <5s | SQLite query + formatting |
| `god sync` (incremental) | ~5-10s | Per project, API-dependent |
| `god sync --force` | ~30-60s | Full 90-day refresh |
| `god agents analyze` | ~10s | Prompt generation only (OpenClaw mode) |
| `god review --month` | <2s | SQLite aggregation |
| Database size | 400KB | 631 commits + metadata |

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. OpenClaw Agent Analysis Caching
- **Issue:** No automatic caching of agent-provided JSON responses
- **Impact:** Low - Each analysis regenerates prompt (acceptable in interactive mode)
- **Workaround:** Standalone mode (API keys) does cache responses
- **Future:** v0.2.0 could add `god agents cache <json-file>` command

---

## Recommendations

### For v0.1.1 (Polish & Enhancements)
1. **Add status --window flag** - Allow custom date ranges (7d/30d/90d)
2. **Improve error messages** - More helpful when API limits hit
3. **Add progress indicators** - For long-running syncs

### For v0.2.0 (Enhancements)
4. **Monthly review analysis** - `god review --analyze` for LLM insights
5. **Trend comparison** - Compare month-over-month activity
6. **Contributor spotlight** - "Who's doing what" breakdown
7. **Agent cache command** - Manual caching of OpenClaw analysis
8. **Export to markdown** - Shareable monthly reports

### For v0.3.0 (Advanced Features)
9. **Health scoring** - Project health metrics (stale PRs, test coverage trends)
10. **Predictive insights** - "Project X usually quiet this time of month"
11. **Multi-team support** - Filter by team/contributor
12. **GitHub Actions integration** - Auto-post review to issues/wiki
