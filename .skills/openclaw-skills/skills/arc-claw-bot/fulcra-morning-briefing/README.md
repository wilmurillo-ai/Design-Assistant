# 🌅 Fulcra Morning Briefing

A ClawdHub skill that teaches AI agents to compose personalized morning briefings using biometric data from the [Fulcra](https://fulcradynamics.com) Life API.

## What It Does

Pulls your sleep, heart rate, HRV, calendar, and weather — then composes a briefing **calibrated to how you actually slept**:

- **Bad sleep?** Short, gentle, essentials only
- **Good sleep?** Full detail, upbeat, actionable
- **Great sleep?** Ambitious, push you to make the most of it

## Quick Start

1. Install: `pip3 install fulcra-api`
2. Authorize: `python3 authorize_fulcra.py` (one-time, your human approves)
3. Collect data: `python3 collect_briefing_data.py --location "Your+City"`
4. Agent reads the JSON and composes a briefing using the tone rules in SKILL.md
