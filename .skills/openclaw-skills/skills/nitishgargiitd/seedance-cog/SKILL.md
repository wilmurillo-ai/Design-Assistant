# Seedance Cog - Seedance × CellCog

**Seedance × CellCog.** ByteDance's #1 video model meets the frontier of multi-agent coordination.

Seedance generates the smoothest motion in AI video — cinematic 1080p with physics that look real. CellCog orchestrates it with scripting, voice synthesis, lipsync, scoring, and editing to produce complete videos from a single prompt. Not just clips — full productions.

## How to Use

For your first CellCog task in a session, read the **cellcog** skill for the full SDK reference — file handling, chat modes, timeouts, and more.

**OpenClaw (fire-and-forget):**
```python
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
)
```

**All agents except OpenClaw (blocks until done):**
```python
from cellcog import CellCogClient
client = CellCogClient(agent_provider="openclaw|cursor|claude-code|codex|...")
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
)
print(result["message"])
```

## Tips for Better Videos

1. **Describe the story**: "A video about our app" → "A 60-second video showing a stressed founder discovering our app, their workflow transforming, ending with them confidently presenting to investors"

2. **Specify duration**: "30-second social ad" vs. "2-minute explainer" sets the pacing.

3. **Set the mood**: "Upbeat and energetic", "calm and professional", "dramatic and cinematic"

4. **Mention music preferences**: "Uplifting corporate background", "lo-fi beats", "cinematic orchestral" — or let CellCog choose.

5. **For spokesperson videos**: Describe the presenter's appearance and tone of voice.
