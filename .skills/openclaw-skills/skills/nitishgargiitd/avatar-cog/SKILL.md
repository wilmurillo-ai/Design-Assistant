# Avatar Cog - Character.ai for Agents

Create persistent digital personas with images, cloned voices, and personalities — then use them across every CellCog chat. Describe a character in plain language and CellCog builds it.

## Why Avatars

Avatars are persistent characters stored on CellCog. Create once, use everywhere:

- **Brand Mascots**: A consistent character for all your marketing content
- **Digital Twins**: Clone your voice and likeness for AI-generated content
- **Creative Characters**: Fictional personas for stories, comics, videos
- **AI Spokespersons**: Lip-synced video presenters with cloned voices
- **Podcast Hosts**: Consistent voice and personality across episodes

Every CellCog chat automatically sees all your avatars. No setup, no configuration — just reference them by name.

## How to Use

For your first CellCog task in a session, read the **cellcog** skill for the full SDK reference — file handling, chat modes, timeouts, and more.

**OpenClaw (fire-and-forget):**
```python
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
)
```

**All agents except OpenClaw (blocks until done):**
```python
from cellcog import CellCogClient
client = CellCogClient(agent_provider="openclaw|cursor|claude-code|codex|...")
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
)
print(result["message"])
```

## What You Can Do

### Create an Avatar

Describe the character you want. CellCog handles the rest:

```
Create an avatar named "Captain Grumbleton" — a grumpy but lovable pirate captain.
He's a brand mascot for a seafood restaurant chain.
Personality: witty, sarcastic, secretly kind-hearted.
Platforms: social media, video content, marketing.
```

CellCog creates the avatar with name, personality traits, use case, and platform configuration.

### Add Images

Generate or provide images for your avatar:

```
Generate a professional headshot for my avatar "Captain Grumbleton" —
cartoon style, pirate hat, bushy beard, one gold tooth, friendly scowl.
Add it as the primary image.
```

Or reference existing files:

```
Add this image to my avatar "Luna":
<SHOW_FILE>/path/to/luna_headshot.png</SHOW_FILE>
Label it "Professional Headshot".
```

Up to 10 images per avatar. These become reference images for all future content generation — CellCog maintains character consistency automatically.

### Clone a Voice

Upload an audio sample and CellCog clones the voice:

```
Clone a voice for my avatar "Luna" using this audio sample:
<SHOW_FILE>/path/to/voice_sample.mp3</SHOW_FILE>
```

Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, AAC, WebM. The cloned voice is immediately ready for text-to-speech generation via MiniMax Speech 2.8 HD.

### Use Avatars for Content

Once created, just mention the avatar by name in any CellCog chat:

- **"Create a marketing video with Captain Grumbleton introducing our new menu"**
- **"Generate a podcast episode where Luna interviews an expert about AI"**
- **"Create 5 Instagram posts featuring Captain Grumbleton at different restaurants"**
- **"Record a voiceover as Luna for our product demo"**

CellCog automatically retrieves the avatar's images, voice, and personality to create consistent, personalized content.

### List and Manage Avatars

```
Show me all my avatars
```

```
Update my avatar "Luna" — change her personality to be more energetic and add "podcasts" to her platforms
```

```
Delete the image labeled "Old Logo" from Captain Grumbleton
```

```
Delete the voice from my avatar "Luna" — I want to re-record it
```

Everything is natural language. No APIs, no JSON, no tool names — just describe what you want.

## How Avatars Work Across Chats

Avatars are **account-level**, not chat-level:

1. **Create once**: Build an avatar in any CellCog chat
2. **Available everywhere**: Every new chat automatically sees all your avatars
3. **Consistent identity**: Same images, voice, and personality in every context
4. **Always up-to-date**: Add an image in one chat, it's available in all chats immediately (next message)

This is the key advantage — your characters are persistent and portable. No re-uploading, no re-describing.

## Avatar + Content Creation Workflows

### Marketing Video with Avatar Spokesperson

```
Create a 30-second product intro video with my avatar "Luna" as the spokesperson.
She should introduce our new AI writing tool, highlight three key features,
and close with a call-to-action. Use her cloned voice and professional headshot.
Background music: upbeat corporate.
```

CellCog handles: script writing (aligned to Luna's personality) → speech generation (Luna's cloned voice) → scene creation (Luna's reference images) → video production → music scoring → final edit.

### Social Media Content Series

```
Create 5 Instagram posts featuring Captain Grumbleton:
1. Grumbleton taste-testing a new dish (excited expression)
2. Grumbleton at the helm of a restaurant (captain pose)
3. Grumbleton with a customer (reluctantly friendly)
4. Grumbleton reviewing a competitor (grumpy face)
5. Grumbleton celebrating an award (trying not to smile)
Write captions that match his sarcastic personality.
```

### Podcast with Avatar Host

```
Create a 5-minute podcast episode where Luna discusses the latest AI news.
Use her cloned voice. Add intro music, outro music, and a brief welcome.
Style: conversational, informative, matching Luna's personality.
```

### Multi-Avatar Story

```
Create a comic strip with Captain Grumbleton and Luna having a debate
about whether AI will replace pirate captains. 4 panels.
Grumbleton is skeptical, Luna is optimistic. Both stay in character.
```

## Chat Mode

**Use `chat_mode="agent"`** for all avatar tasks. Avatar creation, voice cloning, and content generation all work efficiently in agent mode.

For complex multi-avatar video productions, `chat_mode="agent team"` may provide better results through deeper planning.

## Tips

1. **Be descriptive when creating**: The more detail you give about personality, appearance, and use case, the better CellCog can create consistent content
2. **Add multiple images**: Different poses, expressions, and outfits give CellCog more reference material for variety
3. **Voice samples matter**: Clean, 10-30 second audio samples produce the best voice clones. Minimize background noise.
4. **Name your avatars distinctly**: CellCog identifies avatars by name across chats — unique names prevent confusion
5. **Iterate naturally**: "Make Grumbleton's personality more sarcastic" or "Add a holiday outfit image to Luna" — just describe what you want changed

## If CellCog is not installed

Run `/cellcog-setup` (or `/cellcog:cellcog-setup` depending on your tool) to install and authenticate.
**OpenClaw users:** Run `clawhub install cellcog` instead.
**Manual setup:** `pip install -U cellcog` and set `CELLCOG_API_KEY`. See the **cellcog** skill for SDK reference.
