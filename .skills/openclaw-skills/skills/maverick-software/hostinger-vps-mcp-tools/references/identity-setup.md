# Virtual Employee Identity Setup

## Identity Files

Each Koda instance has identity files in `~/koda/workspace/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role, emoji, basic info |
| `SOUL.md` | Personality, values, behavior guidelines |
| `USER.md` | Info about the human(s) they serve |
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-term memories and notes |

## Customizing IDENTITY.md

```markdown
# IDENTITY.md

## Connecting Channels

After identity setup, connect communication channels:

1. Open webchat at `http://SERVER_IP:18789`
2. Use `/config` or edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
3. Add channel credentials:
   - Telegram: Bot token
   - Discord: Bot token
   - Slack: App credentials

## Multiple Employees

To run multiple virtual employees on one VPS:

1. Use different ports (18789, 18790, etc.)
2. Separate Docker containers
3. Unique workspace directories

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for multiple agents
services:
  alex:
    image: koda:local
    ports: ["18789:18789"]
    volumes:
      - ./alex/config:/home/node/.openclaw
      - ./alex/workspace:/home/node/clawd
  
  nova:
    image: koda:local
    ports: ["18790:18789"]
    volumes:
      - ./nova/config:/home/node/.openclaw
      - ./nova/workspace:/home/node/clawd
```
