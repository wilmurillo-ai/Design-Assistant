# Example Prompts

## Start a Call

User:
"Call +46700000000 and confirm my appointment for Tuesday at 2pm."

Expected behavior:
- Resolve API key from `CALLMYCALL_API_KEY`, then `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (`skills.openclaw-phone.apiKey`), and only then prompt for one-time use.
- If the user asks for persistence, provide manual instructions for writing `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
- Use layered gating to collect any missing details (language, call brief).
- Present a review summary and ask for confirmation.
- Call `POST /v1/start-call` with `phone_number` and `task`.
- Save the returned `sid` in `recent_calls`.
- Confirm in chat with call ID.
