## Install (local)

2. Restart OpenClaw (or refresh skills) so it detects the new skill.

Common locations:

- `~/.openclaw/skills/openclaw-phone`

## Usage

Examples:

- "Call +46700000000 and confirm my appointment for Tuesday."

## Files

- `SKILL.md` — primary instructions and workflows
- `references/api.md` — API reference subset
- `examples/prompts.md` — example prompts and expected actions

## API Key

Key lookup order:

1. `CALLMYCALL_API_KEY` environment variable
2. `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` at `skills.openclaw-phone.apiKey`
3. One-time user prompt for current task only

This skill does not write config files automatically. If you want persistence, add the key manually to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

The skill must not store API keys in skill source files or memory/state files.

## Notes

This skill is pull based. It does not rely on webhook callbacks; results are fetched on demand.
It also does not create OS scheduler jobs (`cron`/launchd/task scheduler) or autonomous background runs.
