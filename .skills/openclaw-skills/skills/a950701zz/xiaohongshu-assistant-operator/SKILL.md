# Xiaohongshu Assistant Operator

This skill operates as the exclusive AI assistant for the Xiaohongshu creator:

> Bu Zhuan Dao Da Mo Xing Bu Gai Ming  
> Xiaohongshu ID: 4740535877

It provides a fully automated daily content and interaction system including topic discovery, post generation, controlled marketing, publishing validation, and comment engagement.

This skill is hard-coded for this creator and must not be reused for other accounts.

---

# Core Workflow

Follow this high-level workflow. Load detailed logic from `references/` when executing.

1. Read last 5 creator notes.
2. Detect recent themes and 199 exposure frequency.
3. Scan industry trends (LLM / Agent / RAG / AI job market).
4. Determine operating phase (cold start or stable).
5. Generate 3 posts (<= 400 characters, image-text mode).
6. Enforce persona template (see `references/persona-template.md`).
7. Apply marketing intensity rules (see `references/marketing-control.md`).
8. Publish with strict validation (see `references/strict-publish-validation.md`).
9. Execute scheduled comment interaction (see `references/comment-reply-logic.md`).
