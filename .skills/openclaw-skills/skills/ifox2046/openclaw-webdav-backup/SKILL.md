# OpenClaw WebDAV Backup

Lightweight backup/restore skill for OpenClaw.

It covers:
- local backup archives (full and incremental)
- multi-level backup strategies (smart, daily, hourly)
- optional encryption for `openclaw.json`
- optional WebDAV upload
- restore from local backup archives
- backup version management (list, select, delete)
- backup integrity verification
- configuration health checks
- lightweight scheduled backup guidance
- optional Telegram notifications for backup success/failure

It does **not** provide WebDAV storage. The user must supply their own WebDAV endpoint and credentials.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- back up OpenClaw (full or incremental)
- restore OpenClaw from backup
- migrate OpenClaw to a new VM or machine
- protect backup configs with encryption
- upload backups to a self-provided WebDAV target
- schedule daily or periodic backups
- receive Telegram notifications for scheduled backup success/failure
- prepare a simple disaster-recovery workflow
- check backup configuration health
- verify backup integrity
- manage backup versions (list, delete old backups)

## Implementation layout

Canonical implementation lives inside the skill:
- `scripts/openclaw-backup.impl.sh`
- `scripts/openclaw-restore.impl.sh`

Thin wrapper scripts may also exist in the workspace and call these implementations. Keep the skill scripts as the source of truth.

## Default workflow

### 1. Local backup (full)
```bash
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh
```

### 2. Incremental backup with smart strategy
Auto-determines level based on day:
- Sunday: Level 0 (full backup)
- Monday-Saturday: Level 1 (incremental)

```bash
# Smart strategy (recommended for cron)
BACKUP_STRATEGY=smart bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh

# Or explicitly set level
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh --level=1
```

### 3. Encrypted backup + WebDAV upload
Prepare `.env.backup` with the user's own WebDAV settings, then run:
```bash
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh --encrypt-config --upload
```
Only do real upload after confirming the user wants to write to the remote WebDAV target.

### 4. Restore from a local backup set
```bash
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-restore.sh --from backups/openclaw/latest --decrypt-config
```

## Backup Strategies

The skill supports multiple backup strategies via `BACKUP_STRATEGY` environment variable:

| Strategy | Description | Level Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `full` (default) | Always full backup | Level 0 |
| `weekly` | Weekly full backup | Level 0 |
| `daily` | Daily with auto-incremental | Level 0 once, then Level 1 |
| `smart` | Recommended for production | Sunday=Level 0, Mon-Sat=Level 1 |
| `hourly` | Fine-grained incremental | Level 0 → 1 → 2 chain |

### Level Explanation

- **Level 0**: Full backup (tar creates complete archive + snapshot file)
- **Level 1**: Incremental backup (only files changed since Level 0)
- **Level 2**: Incremental backup (only files changed since Level 1)

### Cron Examples

```bash
# Smart strategy: Sunday full, weekdays incremental
0 0 * * 0 BACKUP_STRATEGY=smart /path/to/openclaw-backup.sh --upload
30 3 * * 1-6 BACKUP_STRATEGY=smart /path/to/openclaw-backup.sh --upload

# Weekly full only
0 3 * * 0 BACKUP_STRATEGY=weekly /path/to/openclaw-backup.sh --upload

# Daily with auto-level detection
0 3 * * * BACKUP_STRATEGY=daily /path/to/openclaw-backup.sh
```

### Manual Level Control

Override auto-detection with `--level` flag:
```bash
bash openclaw-backup.sh --level=0  # Force full backup
bash openclaw-backup.sh --level=1  # Force incremental (level 1)
```

## Compression Options

The skill supports multiple compression tools with automatic detection of parallel variants:

| Option | Tool | Threads | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `gzip` | gzip | 1 | Standard, widely available |
| `pigz` | pigz | N | Parallel gzip, 3-5x faster |
| `zstd` | zstd | 1 | High compression ratio |
| `pzstd` | pzstd | N | Parallel zstd, fastest option |

### Auto-Detection

By default, the skill auto-detects the best available compressor:
```bash
# Prefers pigz > gzip, pzstd > zstd
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh
```

### Explicit Selection

Force a specific compressor:
```bash
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh --compress=pigz
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh --compress=pzstd
```

### Parallel Jobs

Control the number of compression threads (default: auto-detect CPU cores):
```bash
# Use 8 threads explicitly
PARALLEL_JOBS=8 bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh

# Or via CLI
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-backup.sh --jobs=8
```

### Installation

Install parallel compression tools for best performance:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install pigz zstd

# macOS
brew install pigz zstd

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install pigz zstd
```

## Backup Notifications

The skill supports multiple notification channels for backup success/failure alerts.

### Supported Channels

| Channel | Status | Configuration |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Telegram | ✅ Ready | Bot token + Chat ID |
| WeCom (企业微信) | ✅ Ready | Webhook key |
| Feishu (飞书) | ✅ Ready | Webhook token |

### Quick Setup

1. Copy the example config:
```bash
cp references/env.backup.notify.example .env.backup.notify
```

2. Edit `.env.backup.notify` with your channel settings:

#### Telegram Setup
```bash
BACKUP_NOTIFY=1
BACKUP_NOTIFY_CHANNEL="telegram"
BACKUP_NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="123456789"
BACKUP_NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="123456:your-bot-token"  # Optional, can auto-detect
```

#### WeCom (企业微信) Setup
```bash
BACKUP_NOTIFY=1
BACKUP_NOTIFY_CHANNEL="wecom"
BACKUP_NOTIFY_WECOM_KEY="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
BACKUP_NOTIFY_WECOM_MENTION="13800138000,13900139000"  # Optional: mobile numbers
```
*Get webhook key from: Group Settings → Add Robot → Copy Webhook URL key*

#### Feishu (飞书) Setup
```bash
BACKUP_NOTIFY=1
BACKUP_NOTIFY_CHANNEL="feishu"
BACKUP_NOTIFY_FEISHU_TOKEN="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
BACKUP_NOTIFY_FEISHU_SECRET="your-secret"  # Optional: if signature enabled
```
*Get webhook token from: Group Settings → Add Bot → Copy Webhook URL token*

### Notification Content

Notifications include:
- Backup status (✅ success / ❌ failure)
- Timestamp and backup type
- Local backup location
- Encryption status
- WebDAV upload status
- Retention settings

## Important behavior notes

- `openclaw.json` may contain secrets, tokens, and API keys
- prefer `--encrypt-config` before remote upload
- `.env.backup` stores WebDAV connection settings and should not be committed
- `.env.backup.secret` is optional; it is only a convenience carrier for `BACKUP_ENCRYPT_PASS`
- `.env.backup.notify` is optional and enables backup notifications when configured
- restore depends on the **decryption password itself**, not on the secret file specifically
- for encrypted backups, `.env.backup.secret` and the password are **either/or**: either keep the file, or remember/provide the password
- workspace backups exclude `.env.backup` and `.env.backup.secret`
- local and remote retention are supported through `LOCAL_KEEP` and `REMOTE_KEEP`

## Read references when needed

- For usage, included files, and backup examples: read `references/backup.md`
- For restore/decrypt flow and restore checks: read `references/restore.md`
- For automation with cron/systemd: read `references/scheduling.md`
- For migration/disaster-recovery planning: read `references/migration-plan.md`
- For common user questions and boundary clarifications: read `references/faq.md`
- For config template examples: read `references/env.backup.example`, `references/env.backup.secret.example`, and `references/env.backup.notify.example`

## Validated behaviors

This skill has been validated against a real OpenClaw setup for:
- local backup creation
- encrypted config backup
- WebDAV upload
- local and remote retention
- restore drill to a simulated fresh-machine home directory
- cron-based scheduled backup
- Telegram notification on backup success
- backup integrity verification
- configuration health checks

## Health Check & Integrity Verification

### Configuration Health Check

Run `scripts/openclaw-healthcheck.sh` to diagnose backup environment:

```bash
bash skills/openclaw-webdav-backup/scripts/openclaw-healthcheck.sh
```

Checks performed:
| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Base Environment | workspace dir, state dir, openclaw.json, extensions |
| Backup Infrastructure | backup root, snapshot dir, existing backups |
| Dependencies | tar, curl, openssl availability |
| Configuration | .env.backup, .env.backup.secret variables |
| Backup Integrity | Validates all existing tar.gz archives |

Exit codes:
- `0` - All checks passed
- `1` - One or more critical checks failed

### Backup Integrity Verification

Every backup automatically runs integrity checks:

1. **Archive validation** - `tar -tzf` verifies archive structure
2. **Manifest verification** - Confirms manifest.txt exists
3. **Metadata check** - Confirms workspace.meta exists

Failed integrity checks will abort the backup with error status.

To manually verify a specific backup:
```bash
tar -tzf backups/openclaw/2026-04-02-030000/workspace.tar.gz >/dev/null && echo "Valid" || echo "Corrupted"
```

### Restore with Integrity Check

When restoring, verify the backup before extraction:

```bash
# Check integrity first
bash scripts/openclaw-restore.sh --from <backup_dir> --dry-run

# Then perform actual restore
bash scripts/openclaw-restore.sh --from <backup_dir>
```

## Private-share checklist

Before sharing this skill privately, verify:
- no real `.env.backup` or `.env.backup.secret` is included
- no real WebDAV URL, username, password, token, or backup passphrase remains in tracked files
- examples use placeholder values only
- docs state clearly that WebDAV storage is user-provided
- restore wording states password and secret file are either/or, not both required
- references match actual script behavior

## Scope

This skill intentionally stays lightweight. It supports:
- local backup and restore
- optional config encryption
- optional WebDAV upload
- local and remote retention
- password-based restore with optional secret file automation

It does not currently provide:
- built-in WebDAV provisioning
- secret-manager integration
- fully automatic remote download-and-restore flow
- multi-target cloud replication
