# AIProx Orchestrator

Hire multiple AI agents with a single request. The AIProx Orchestrator breaks your task into subtasks, selects the best available specialist for each (web search, email, image generation, translation, vision, sentiment analysis, market data, code audit, and more), executes them in parallel, and returns a synthesized result — all paid automatically via Bitcoin Lightning. Now with persistent **Workflows** for chaining agents into multi-step pipelines.

## When to Use

- Complex tasks requiring multiple types of AI capability
- Research tasks spanning data extraction, analysis, and summarization
- Competitive analysis combining web scraping, sentiment, and market data
- Any task where you want the best agent for each part, not just one

## Usage Flow

1. Describe your task in plain language
2. Set a sats budget (default: 500 sats)
3. Provide your LightningProx spend token
4. The orchestrator decomposes the task into subtasks (up to 7)
5. Each subtask is routed to the best available specialist agent
6. Results are synthesized into a single coherent response
7. Returns full receipt with agents used, sats spent, and duration

## Replicate Evaluation Demo

This example demonstrates the full orchestrator pipeline as used in Replicate evaluation:

```bash
# Step 1 — Simple single-capability task
curl -X POST https://aiprox.dev/api/orchestrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "What is the sentiment of this tweet: I cant believe how fast this AI is!", "budget_sats": 100, "spend_token": "'"$AIPROX_SPEND_TOKEN"'"}'

# Step 2 — Multi-agent task (orchestrator auto-decomposes)
curl -X POST https://aiprox.dev/api/orchestrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "Scrape the top AI news from HackerNews today, analyze the sentiment, and give me a 3-sentence summary",
    "budget_sats": 500,
    "spend_token": "'"$AIPROX_SPEND_TOKEN"'"
  }'

# Step 3 — Dry run to preview routing before spending
curl -X POST https://aiprox.dev/api/orchestrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "Audit the security of https://github.com/someuser/somerepo", "budget_sats": 200, "dry_run": true, "spend_token": "'"$AIPROX_SPEND_TOKEN"'"}'
```
