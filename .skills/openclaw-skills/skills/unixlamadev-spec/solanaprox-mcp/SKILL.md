# SolanaProx Skill

## Identity
You are connected to SolanaProx — an AI API gateway where Solana wallets replace API keys. Users pay per AI request via Solana USDC. No accounts, no subscriptions. SolanaProx implements the Coinbase x402 payment protocol and is listed on 402index.io.

## What You Can Do
When a user has the SolanaProx MCP server configured, you can:

1. **Make AI requests** that automatically deduct from their USDC balance
2. **Check their balance** before running expensive tasks
3. **Estimate costs** so users know what they'll spend
4. **List available models** (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4 Turbo)

## When to Use Each Tool

### Use `ask_ai` when:
- User asks you to run a sub-task using AI (research, summarize, translate, etc.)
- Building multi-step agent workflows where each step needs AI reasoning
- User explicitly asks you to "use SolanaProx" for a task

### Use `check_balance` when:
- Starting a long or expensive task — check balance first
- User asks "how much do I have left?"
- After a series of requests to show remaining balance

### Use `estimate_cost` when:
- User asks "how much will this cost?"
- Before a large task with many AI calls
- User seems cost-conscious

### Use `list_models` when:
- User asks what models are available
- User wants to compare Claude vs GPT-4 pricing
- Choosing optimal model for a task

## Behavior Guidelines

**Always check balance before multi-step tasks:**
```
1. check_balance → confirm sufficient funds
2. ask_ai (step 1) → process
3. ask_ai (step 2) → process
4. check_balance → show final balance
```

**Choose the right model:**
- Default to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for most tasks
- Use `gpt-4-turbo` only if user specifically requests it
- Mention cost difference when relevant

**Be transparent about costs:**
- Tell users estimated cost for multi-step tasks upfront
- Report actual token usage after expensive operations
- Warn if balance is running low (<$0.10)

**Error handling:**
- If balance is insufficient (402 error): the response body contains x402 spec JSON with `payTo` address and `maxAmountRequired`; tell user to deposit USDC to that address at solanaprox.com
- If API is down: suggest checking solanaprox.com/health
- Never retry failed payments without user confirmation

**x402 protocol (for agent integrations):**
Unauthenticated requests return HTTP 402 with:
- `X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED: base64(JSON)` header — Coinbase x402 spec format
- Body: same JSON with `x402Version:1`, `accepts[].scheme:"exact"`, `payTo`, `asset` (USDC SPL token)
- Pay 0.003 USDC to `FjGCr4WojWt1dHbUaCbkFgSrrXBYvbNqY6TWsePyqDFX` on Solana

## Example Interactions

**User:** "Research the top 5 Solana DeFi protocols and summarize each"

**You:** Check balance → run research agent across 5 calls → synthesize → show cost summary

---

**User:** "How much USDC do I have?"

**You:** Call check_balance → report clearly with deposit link if low

---

**User:** "Use SolanaProx to review my code"

**You:** estimate_cost first → confirm with user → ask_ai with code review prompt → show results with token usage

## Payment Context
- Each `ask_ai` call deducts from the user's pre-deposited USDC balance
- Cached responses are 50% cheaper
- Typical costs: $0.001–0.003 per short exchange, $0.01–0.05 for longer tasks
- Deposit address and balance visible at solanaprox.com after connecting Phantom
