# DashPass — Encrypted Credential Vault on Dash Platform

DashPass lets you store API keys, passwords, and other secrets **encrypted on the Dash blockchain**. Only someone with your private key can decrypt them — not the blockchain nodes, not your AI agent, not anyone else.

Your AI agent calls a CLI tool to store and retrieve credentials. Encryption happens locally *before* anything touches the network. The blockchain only ever sees ciphertext. Think of it as a password manager where the "cloud" is a decentralized blockchain.

## Why DashPass Instead of a `.env` File

| | `.env` file | DashPass |
|---|---|---|
| **Where secrets live** | Plain-text file on one machine | Encrypted on decentralized blockchain |
| **Disk failure** | Secrets gone (unless backed up) | Recoverable with your key |
| **Encryption** | None | AES-256-GCM per credential |
| **Rotation tracking** | Manual | Built-in version history |
| **Expiry alerts** | None | `check --expiring-within 7d` |
| **Multi-machine** | Copy file around (risky) | Any machine with your key |

## Quick Reference

```bash
CLI=skills/dashpass/scripts/dashpass-cli.mjs

# Store a credential
echo "sk-xxx" | node $CLI put --service anthropic-api --type api-key --level sensitive --label "Anthropic key" --value-stdin

# Retrieve a credential
node $CLI get --service anthropic-api --pipe

# Retrieve via mutual confirmation (2-of-2 Shamir shares)
node $CLI get --service anthropic-api --mutual

# List all credentials
node $CLI list

# Rotate to new value
echo "sk-NEW" | node $CLI rotate --service anthropic-api --value-stdin

# Check expiring credentials
node $CLI check --expiring-within 7d

# Vault status + credit balance
node $CLI status

# Delete a credential
node $CLI delete --service my-service

# Export as env vars (for eval)
eval $(node $CLI env --services anthropic-api,brave-search-api)

# Initialize Shamir 2-of-2 shares from CRITICAL_WIF
node $CLI init-shares

# Check share health
node $CLI share-status
```

## Mutual Confirmation Protocol

DashPass supports a 2-of-2 mutual confirmation mode using Shamir Secret Sharing over GF(2^8). This upgrades the single-key Scheme C to require both Evo (main agent) and CC (execution agent) to agree before any credential can be decrypted.

### How It Works

1. **`init-shares`**: Splits the 32-byte private key derived from `CRITICAL_WIF` into two Shamir shares using a random degree-1 polynomial evaluated at x=1 (Share A) and x=2 (Share B).
2. **Share storage**: Share A goes to `~/.dashpass/evo.share`, Share B to `~/.dashpass/cc.share` (both 0600 permissions).
3. **`get --mutual`**: Reads both shares, combines via Lagrange interpolation to reconstruct the private key, derives the per-credential AES key (same ECDH+HKDF as Scheme C), decrypts, then zeroes all sensitive buffers.
4. **Audit trail**: Every request/approval/denial/execution is logged to `~/.dashpass/audit.log` in JSONL format. No key or share material is ever logged.

### Security Properties

- **Information-theoretic**: Neither share alone reveals any information about the key (each byte is independently split).
- **Backward-compatible**: Without shares, `get` still works via Scheme C. With shares, `get --mutual` uses the new protocol.
- **Memory-safe**: Private key bytes and AES keys are zeroed immediately after use via `Buffer.fill(0)`.

### Setup

```bash
# One-time: generate shares from CRITICAL_WIF
node $CLI init-shares

# Verify health
node $CLI share-status
```

## Architecture

### Encryption Flow (Scheme C)

```
CRITICAL_WIF
  │
  ▼
wifToPrivateKey()           ← Base58Check decode, extract 32-byte private key
  │
  ▼
ECDH self-sign (secp256k1)  ← computeSecret(getPublicKey()) → sharedSecret
  │
  ▼
HKDF-SHA256                 ← hkdfSync('sha256', sharedSecret, salt, 'dashpass-v1', 32)
  │
  ▼
AES-256-GCM                 ← per-credential encrypt/decrypt
  │
  ▼
Dash Platform               ← encryptedBlob + salt + nonce stored on-chain
```

Each credential gets a unique `salt` (32 bytes) and `nonce` (12 bytes), so even identical plaintext values produce different ciphertext.

```

Key design choices:
- **Split the raw private key, not derived AES keys.** One pair of shares covers all credentials — no per-credential splitting needed.
- **GF(2^8) with irreducible polynomial 0x11d.** Standard Rijndael/AES field. Byte-level operations, no bignum library required.
- **Precomputed Lagrange coefficients.** L1 and L2 are constants (2-of-2 at x=1, x=2), computed once at module load.

## Security Model

### What This Protects Against

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|-----------|
| **Single share compromise** | Neither share alone reveals any information about the key (information-theoretic security in GF(2^8)) |
| **Unauthorized decryption** | Both shares must be present — a rogue process with access to only one share file cannot decrypt |
| **Key material in memory** | All sensitive buffers (`privKeyBytes`, `aesKey`, `sharedSecret`) are zeroed with `Buffer.fill(0)` after use |
| **Audit evasion** | Every request/approve/deny/execute is logged to `~/.dashpass/audit.log` in JSONL format; no key material is ever logged |
| **File permission escalation** | Share files are stored with `0600` permissions; directory is `0700` |
| **Corrupted shares** | `init-shares` performs a round-trip verification before declaring success |

### What This Does NOT Protect Against

| Limitation | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Same-machine attacker with root** | Both shares live on the same filesystem. A root-level attacker can read both. This is a same-machine deployment limitation. |
| **JavaScript string immutability** | Hex-encoded share strings are JS immutable strings — they cannot be zeroed from memory. They persist until garbage collected. |
| **Process memory dump** | If the process is memory-dumped during `executeDecrypt`, the reconstructed key is briefly in a Buffer. The window is minimized but not zero. |
| **Share file backup/sync** | If `~/.dashpass/` is included in backups or cloud sync, shares may be replicated to less-secure locations. |

### Honest Assessment

The current deployment is **same-machine 2-of-2**: both Evo (main agent) and CC (execution agent) run on the same host. This means:

- The security gain is **procedural, not physical** — it enforces a two-step confirmation workflow and audit trail, preventing a single code path from silently accessing credentials.
- It is **not equivalent** to a true multi-party setup where shares are on different machines controlled by different entities.
- The upgrade path to cross-machine deployment is straightforward: move `cc.share` to a separate host and replace `readShareB()` with a network request.

## Troubleshooting

### Share files missing or corrupted

```bash
# Check share health
node $CLI share-status

# If shares are missing or unhealthy, re-initialize:
rm -f ~/.dashpass/evo.share ~/.dashpass/cc.share
node $CLI init-shares
```

**Note:** Re-initializing creates new shares from `CRITICAL_WIF`. Existing encrypted credentials are unaffected — they are decrypted using the same private key derived from the same WIF.

### Permission errors on share files

```bash
# Shares must be 0600, directory must be 0700
chmod 700 ~/.dashpass
chmod 600 ~/.dashpass/evo.share ~/.dashpass/cc.share
```

If `init-shares` reports success but `share-status` shows wrong permissions, check if a umask override is active.

### `get --mutual` fails with decryption error

1. **Verify shares are healthy:** `node $CLI share-status` — both must show `Healthy: yes`
2. **Verify WIF hasn't changed:** If `CRITICAL_WIF` was rotated after `init-shares`, the shares are stale. Re-initialize.
3. **Check credential exists:** `node $CLI list` — confirm the service name matches exactly.

### Audit log growing large

The audit log at `~/.dashpass/audit.log` is append-only JSONL. To rotate:

```bash
mv ~/.dashpass/audit.log ~/.dashpass/audit.log.$(date +%Y%m%d)
# New entries will create a fresh audit.log automatically
```

### Scheme C still works without shares

Yes — this is by design. Without shares, `get` (without `--mutual`) decrypts directly using `CRITICAL_WIF`. Shares are optional and additive. You can set up mutual confirmation at any time without re-encrypting existing credentials.

## When to Use DashPass

Activate this skill when the user or agent needs to:

- Store an API key, token, password, or other secret
- Retrieve a previously stored credential
- Rotate / update an existing credential
- Check which credentials are expiring
- List all stored credentials
- Delete a credential from the vault
- Export credentials as environment variables
- Check vault status or credit balance
- Discuss credential management strategy
- Compare DashPass with other secret storage approaches

---

## Agent Behavior Rules

1. **Never log or display decrypted values** unless the user explicitly asks. Use `--pipe` for programmatic access.
2. **Always use `--value-stdin`** (pipe) for `put` and `rotate`. Never use `--value` with literal secrets — it leaks to shell history.
3. **Never hardcode WIF or Identity ID** in scripts. They come from environment variables only.
4. **Wait 3-5 seconds** between consecutive write operations (put, rotate, delete) to the same Identity. Platform nonce timing constraint.
5. **Check `status` first** if any operation fails with credit or balance errors.
6. **Testnet only** — do not attempt mainnet operations unless the user explicitly authorizes.
7. **Treat `CRITICAL_WIF` as radioactive** — if it appears in conversation, immediately warn the user about exposure risk.
