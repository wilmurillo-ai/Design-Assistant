# Source File Header Templates

License headers should be placed at the top of source files to indicate copyright and licensing.

---

## When to Use Source Headers

**Required:**
- GPL/LGPL/AGPL (strongly recommended by FSF)
- MPL-2.0 (required per file)
- Apache-2.0 (recommended)

For Mulan PSL v2, use the official header text in `references/mulan-psl-v2.md` and preserve the wording exactly.

**Recommended:**
- All licenses for clarity
- Multi-contributor projects
- Projects that may be forked

**Optional:**
- Small personal projects
- MIT/BSD with clear LICENSE file

## Preserving Headers in Minification

Configure your build tools to preserve license headers:

### Terser (JavaScript)

```javascript
// terser.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: {
    comments: /^\s*!|@license|@preserve|Copyright/i
  }
};
```

### Webpack

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        terserOptions: {
          output: {
            comments: /@license|@preserve|Copyright/i,
          },
        },
        extractComments: false,
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

### CSS (cssnano)

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('cssnano')({
      preset: ['default', {
        discardComments: {
          removeAll: false,
          remove: (comment) => !/@license|@preserve|Copyright/i.test(comment)
        }
      }]
    })
  ]
};
```
