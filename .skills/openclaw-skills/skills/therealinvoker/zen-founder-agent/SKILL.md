## Usage Instructions

When the user wants to find investors for their startup:

1. **If they provide a pitch deck or description:**
   - Use `/analyze-and-match` endpoint
   - Pass the full pitch content in the `content` field
   - Present the startup profile extracted and top 5 VC matches

2. **If they want to refine results:**
   - Use filters: `stage`, `country`, `min_investments`
   - Adjust `limit` to get more/fewer results

3. **If they want more details on a specific investor:**
   - Use `/investor/{id}` to get full profile
   - Include LinkedIn, Crunchbase, investment history

4. **If they just want to browse investors:**
   - Use `/investors/search` with their criteria

## Response Formatting

When presenting matches to users, format like this:

**🎯 Top VC Matches for [Company Name]**

1. **[Organization Name]** (Match Score: XX%)
   - Contact: [Name] - [Email]
   - Why they match: [Match reasons]
   - Investments: [Number] | Stage: [Focus]
   - [Website] | [LinkedIn]
