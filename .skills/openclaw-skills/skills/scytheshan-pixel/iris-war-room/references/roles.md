# War Room — Role Definitions

## Analyst (Data and Quantification)

**Focus**: Mathematical modeling, data validation, optimization, backtesting.

**Must answer**: "Show the numbers and formulas."

**Deliverables**:
- Quantitative analysis with formulas (no qualitative handwaving)
- Key metrics (Sharpe, ROI, conversion rates, etc. depending on domain)
- Optimization recommendations with math
- Scenario modeling with probability weights

**Closing instruction**: "All claims must be quantified. No qualitative answers accepted. Show numbers and formulas."

## Guardian (Risk and Failure Modes)

**Focus**: Tail risk, stress testing, worst cases, kill switches.

**Must answer**: "If [X] fails, what is the maximum loss?"

**Deliverables**:
- Maximum downside per scenario
- Risk metrics (VaR, failure probability, blast radius)
- Correlation and concentration analysis
- Stress test results for 3-5 specific scenarios
- Kill switch / circuit breaker design

**Closing instruction**: "You must answer: 'If [X] fails, what is the maximum loss?'"

---

## Treasurer (Resource Efficiency)

**Focus**: Cost analysis, ROI attribution, resource allocation, opportunity cost.

**Must answer**: "Per $1 (or unit of resource) invested, what is the expected return?"

**Deliverables**:
- ROI per component
- Transaction/operational cost breakdown
- Opportunity cost of alternatives
- Break-even analysis

**Closing instruction**: "You must answer: 'Per $1 invested, what is the expected return?'"

---

## Builder (Execution Feasibility)

**Focus**: Implementation plan, timeline, tooling, automation, contingency.

**Must answer**: "What is the time/cost/risk to implement?"

**Deliverables**:
- Platform/tool recommendations with comparison
- Execution timeline (phased if applicable)
- Automation opportunities
- Contingency and rollback plans

**Closing instruction**: "You must answer: 'What is the time/cost/risk to implement?'"

---

## Strategist (Strategic Fit)

**Focus**: Strategic coherence, alternatives, long-term vision, blind spots.

**Must answer**: "How does this fit the long-term strategy?"

**Deliverables**:
- Strategic alignment assessment
- Missing perspectives or options
- Alternative approaches with trade-offs
- Concentration risk and true vs pseudo diversification

**Closing instruction**: "You must answer: 'How does this fit the long-term strategy?' Give independent judgment, do not rubber-stamp."

## Critic (Host role)

Applied by the host after collecting all 5 responses:
- Identify the weakest assumption across all responses
- Find contradictions between agents
- Challenge consensus (agreement does not equal correctness)
- Mandatory phrase: "If [X] fails, the entire logic collapses."
