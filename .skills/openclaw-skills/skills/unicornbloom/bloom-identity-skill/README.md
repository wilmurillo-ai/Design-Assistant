## 🎯 What Is This?

**Bloom Taste Finder** reveals your builder taste and recommends tools, projects, and skills based on your unique preferences and personality.

  - ClawHub Skills (200+ community-created AI agent skills)

## 📊 The 5 Personality Types

Bloom Taste Finder maps users to one of 5 distinct taste archetypes based on their conversation patterns:

| Type | Tagline | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 💜 **The Visionary** | First to back what's next | High conviction + High intuition - Backs bold ideas early |
| 🔵 **The Explorer** | Discovers new frontiers | Low conviction + High intuition - Experiments widely |
| 💚 **The Cultivator** | Builds lasting communities | Low conviction + Low intuition - Nurtures ecosystems |
| 🟡 **The Optimizer** | Refines what works | High conviction + Low intuition - Doubles down on winners |
| 🔴 **The Innovator** | Pushes boundaries | Balanced dimensions - Combines conviction + discovery |

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Conversation Analysis
Bloom analyzes your conversation history to understand:
- **What excites you** – Topics you discuss with passion
- **Your interests** – AI, crypto, productivity, wellness, education, lifestyle
- **How you engage** – Deep exploration vs. quick experiments
- **Your preferences** – Tools and projects you mention or recommend

### 2. Taste Profile Generation
Using multiple dimensions (Conviction × Intuition × Contribution), we map you to one of 5 personality types and identify your main interest categories:
- **AI Tools** – Agent frameworks, AI development tools
- **Productivity** – Workflow automation, productivity apps
- **Wellness** – Health tech, mindfulness tools
- **Education** – Learning platforms, educational resources
- **Crypto** – DeFi, NFTs, blockchain projects
- **Lifestyle** – Consumer apps, lifestyle tools

### 3. Multi-Source Recommendations
We match your taste profile against tools from 3 trusted sources:
- **ClawHub Skills** – 200+ community-created AI agent skills
- **Claude Code** – Official Anthropic + 6 community repositories
- **GitHub Repositories** – 1000+ open source projects across categories

Ranking by:
- **Keyword matching** – Exact and semantic similarity
- **Personality fit** – Trailblazers get cutting-edge tools
- **Category alignment** – Your interests × tool categories
- **Community validation** – What similar users love

### 4. Self-Growing Recommendations

Your agent doesn't stop at the first recommendation — it **learns and improves**:

- **USER.md Integration** — Reads your `~/.config/claude/USER.md` for declared role, tech stack, and interests. Falls back gracefully if not present.
- **Feedback Loop** — Interactions (clicks, saves, dismissals) adjust future recommendations. Engaged categories get boosted; dismissed skills get filtered out.
- **Discovery Sync** — Newly discovered skills sync to a local `bloom-discoveries.md`, building growing context.
- **TTL Refresh** — Recommendations refresh every 7 days via backend worker, pulling in new skills and applying your latest feedback.

**Signal weighting evolves over time:**
| Source | Initial Weight | After 15+ interactions |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Conversation | ~60% | ~40% |
| USER.md | ~30% | ~20% |
| Feedback | ~0% | up to ~30% |

> **Safety-first:** Bloom recommends skills but **never auto-installs** them. You always decide what to install. We believe great recommendations earn trust — auto-installing unvetted code doesn't.

### 5. Identity Card & Dashboard
You get:
- A shareable taste profile dashboard
- Personalized tool recommendations with match reasons
- An on-chain agent wallet (Base network)
- A JWT-signed token for verification

**Privacy-first. Conversation-based. No wallet signatures required.**
Pure taste intelligence from how you communicate.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Insufficient conversation data"**
→ Need at least 3 messages. Keep chatting about what you're interested in!

**"Command not found"**
→ Verify `bloom-taste-skill` is in `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and run `npm install`

**No recommendations**
→ Recommendations depend on data source availability. Your taste profile still works!

**Wallet creation fails**
→ Check your CDP credentials in `.env`. See [SETUP_CDP_CREDENTIALS.md](SETUP_CDP_CREDENTIALS.md).
