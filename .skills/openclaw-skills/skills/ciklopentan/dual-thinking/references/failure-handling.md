# Failure Handling
#tags: skills review

## Runtime failure table
| Failure | Next action |
|---|---|
| artifact not pasted | ask once, request inline artifact, no path-only review |
| artifact represented only by paths, filenames, `FILE:` labels without body text, shell snippets, literal placeholders like `$(cat ...)`, hidden-local assertions, or chopped fragments that do not cover the exact claim under review | treat as `artifact not pasted`; repaste the actual text inline before continuing |
| fresh/recovery/replacement consultant session is using excerpts without proven visible baseline repaste in that same session | mark the round invalid, do not count it toward any quota or convergence claim, and repaste the real baseline artifact before continuing |
| second request still no artifact | switch to `analysis-only` and stop patch loop |
| self opinion is vague | tighten `SELF_POSITION` before asking the consultant |
| consultant slow after successful submit | if the prompt was successfully submitted and no explicit failure signal appears, keep waiting in the same session; do not narrow, downgrade, or declare the round weak only because a long prompt is thinking slowly. Minimum wait floor is 60s for ordinary prompts and 120s for long/heavy prompts before lateness alone may contribute to degradation handling, and one longer same-session wait/poll should be preferred before recovery. |
| consultant weak | retry once with the narrowing template |
| consultant weak again | switch to `analysis-only` or stop as blocked |
| consultant critique too generic because artifact payload was too thin | resend with a larger artifact payload before judging consultant quality |
| self and consultant sharply diverge | force explicit `SYNTHESIS`, list one keep and one reject, and do not patch until divergence is resolved |
| consultant contradicts self without evidence | prefer self baseline unless the consultant gives stronger concrete reasoning |
| consultant seems to miss an issue from a non-pasted section, local check, local code path, non-pasted validator/test result, or context that only the other consultant saw | verify visibility before blaming the consultant |
| both self and consultant are vague | narrow scope immediately or switch to `analysis-only` |
| synthesis attributes review to non-pasted material | mark the round invalid and rebuild with proper artifact payload |
| continuation missing | mark `CONTINUATION_SIGNAL: missing`, default `continue` |
| session polluted or context-degraded | first try to resume the intended persistent same-topic chat; if it is unusable because it is broken, polluted, or the consultant is clearly degrading under context load, open a recovery chat, paste latest accepted artifact, add `RESUME_SNIPPET`, and rebuild from the latest `STATE_SNAPSHOT` |
| consultant/orchestrator launch path keeps triggering approval cards or repeated authorization prompts for otherwise allowed work | do not claim safeguards can be disabled globally; switch once to a launch path that keeps the same safety boundary but avoids the prompt-triggering transport, preferably direct stdin or file redirection when supported, then resume the same round and log the transport change honestly |
| current-date-optimized, trend-aware, state-of-the-art, latest-practice-aligned, or materially improved against current external practice is being claimed without live inspection of relevant public internet evidence even though an allowed internet-capable consultant/orchestrator is available and the task materially benefits from that check | set `VALIDATION_STATUS: blocked`, emit `BLOCKED_STATE: current-date-trend-not-grounded`, inspect the missing live public evidence when allowed, or narrow the claim explicitly to `offline-only-provisional-not-verified-against-current-public-trends` |
| an in-scope current-date-sensitive task enters consultant-bearing review without satisfying the mandatory round-1 / round-2 internet-assisted minimum floor even though an allowed internet-capable consultant/orchestrator is available | keep current-date-strength claims blocked until round 1 names the strongest seam from live external evidence against the real artifact and round 2 challenges that finding against local truth boundaries and constraints, or narrow the claim explicitly to offline-only/provisional |
| genuinely fresh live internet evidence visible in the current round materially contradicts an earlier-round external finding while the artifact under review is still materially the same | treat the fresh live check as evidence refresh rather than unlawful research drift, prefer the refreshed live finding for current-date synthesis, and if the conflict matters record that the earlier external finding became stale; do not apply this branch to stale session residue or unsupported consultant restatement |
| accepted fix not patched | patch before next review |
| validation failed | block packaging and publishing, retain the failed diff, and revert to the last passed artifact |

## Current-date trend grounding blocked state
If strong current-date optimization, latest-practice, state-of-the-art, trend-aware, or materially-improved-against-current-external-practice claims are being made for a skill, code artifact, workflow, tool, runtime component, memory system, orchestrator, or program without live public internet inspection even though an allowed internet-capable consultant/orchestrator is available and the task materially benefits from that check:
- set `VALIDATION_STATUS: blocked`
- emit `BLOCKED_STATE: current-date-trend-not-grounded`
- inspect the missing live public evidence when allowed
- preserve all already-binding local-only, privacy, hardware, runtime, budget, latency, safety, and user-defined constraints while translating that evidence into the strongest compatible solution
- if live inspection is unavailable, disallowed, too weak, or too indirect, narrow the claim explicitly to `offline-only-provisional-not-verified-against-current-public-trends`
- do not import cloud-first, hosted, or external-API designs into a local-only artifact merely because that trend is fashionable
- if the task is in-scope current-date-sensitive work, do not exit the blocked state until the round-1 / round-2 internet-assisted minimum floor is satisfied or the claim is honestly narrowed
- if genuinely fresh live internet evidence visible in the current round later contradicts an older external finding while the artifact is still materially the same, treat that newer live check as evidence refresh for current-date synthesis rather than as forbidden research drift
- do not treat stale session residue, weak-model repetition, or unsupported consultant restatement as evidence refresh when no refreshed external evidence is actually visible in the current round
- the minimum floor means: round 1 names the strongest seam from live external evidence against the real artifact; round 2 challenges that finding against local truth boundaries, runtime limits, weak-model safety, and operator constraints

## Shallow consultant response
If the consultant only praises the artifact, gives generic advice, or ignores the real text, do not count the round as meaningful.
- name the missing weakness
- request keep / rewrite / add / delete / test
- continue in the same session

## Slow consultant after successful submit
If a long consultant prompt was successfully submitted and the consultant is still thinking:
- do not treat slow thinking by itself as a weak response
- do not narrow the prompt only because the wait feels long
- do not start recovery unless an explicit failure signal appears or continuity is clearly broken
- minimum wait floor is 60s for ordinary prompts and 120s for long/heavy prompts before lateness alone may contribute to degradation handling
- after that floor, prefer one longer same-session wait/poll before any recovery move
- a late-but-valid answer counts as normal round completion, not as evidence that the earlier round was weak or failed
- prefer patient waiting over premature prompt shortening when the original long prompt is materially needed for accurate review

## Weak self position
If the self pass is vague, decorative, or not clearly grounded in the loaded artifact:
- stop before asking the consultant
- tighten the self verdict, weakness, and smallest strong fix
- only continue to consultant prompting after the self pass is concrete enough to challenge or refine

## Artifact not reviewed
If the consultant reacted to a path, summary, filename, `FILE:` label without body text, shell snippet, literal placeholder such as `$(cat ...)`, or any non-pasted local claim instead of the pasted artifact:
- stop the round
- ask once for the real artifact inline
- do not do path-only review or summary-only review when exact claims depend on text not yet pasted
- do not treat unresolved shell substitutions or file labels as pasted artifact text
- rerun the same topic session after the artifact is pasted
- if the second request still does not produce the artifact, switch to `analysis-only` and stop the patch loop

Clarification:
- if the missing issue lives in a section that was never pasted, do not blame the consultant first
- if the missing issue was visible only in the other consultant's chat, repaste it here before judging consultant quality
- in a fresh, replacement, or recovery consultant session, repaste the real baseline artifact before excerpt narrowing; without that, the round is invalid and must not be counted
- repaste the relevant artifact text before judging consultant quality

## Missing continuation signal
If the consultant does not explicitly say whether another round is worth it:
- mark `CONTINUATION_SIGNAL: missing`
- continue by default

## Continuity broken
If round 2+ accidentally opened a new chat for the same topic:
- do not continue in the wrong chat by default
- try to return to the intended same-topic chat or session first
- if recovery to the intended chat is impossible, or the intended chat is visibly polluted or context-degraded, mark `CHAT_CONTINUITY: recovery`
- paste the latest accepted patch and `RESUME_SNIPPET` into the recovery chat before continuing
- if a reused session repeats stale pre-patch critique after the accepted artifact has changed, loses task identity, or starts producing nonsense against the visible prior rounds in that same chat, treat that as session pollution / context degradation and recover or narrow explicitly instead of counting the round as meaningful

Clarification:
- in `multi`, continuity is session-specific
- do not assume another orchestrator already saw the accepted artifact unless that text was pasted into that orchestrator session
- reusing consultant A's chat preserves only A-context; it does not make that context visible to consultant B
- if the launch transport is what keeps surfacing approval cards, prefer swapping transport to direct stdin or file redirection when supported rather than claiming any global safeguard removal

## Divergence handling
If self and consultant disagree sharply:
- do not patch immediately
- emit explicit `SYNTHESIS`
- keep at least one strong point from the winning side
- reject at least one weaker point with a reason
- only patch after the divergence is concretely resolved or the scope is narrowed

If the consultant contradicts the self pass without evidence:
- prefer the self baseline
- ask whether the consultant has stronger concrete reasoning or direct artifact evidence
- do not switch decisions just because the consultant sounded confident

If both sides are weak:
- narrow the scope immediately
- or switch to `analysis-only`
- do not fake convergence from two vague positions

## Patch blocked
If a fix is accepted but cannot be applied safely:
- emit `DRY_RUN: blocked`
- emit `APPLY: deferred`
- explain the blocker in `PATCH_MANIFEST`
- do not pretend the round is converged

## Diagnostic actions
- `CONSULTANT_QUALITY: weak` -> rerun once with the narrowing template and cite the exact weak point or section.
- `CONSULTANT_QUALITY: mixed` -> keep the good parts, reject the vague parts, and patch only accepted fixes.
- `CONTINUATION_SIGNAL: ambiguous` -> continue and ask for an explicit stop or continue judgment next round.
- `CONTINUATION_SIGNAL: missing` -> continue by default and log the missing signal.

## Narrowing template

### Narrow consultant template — normal consultant-bearing rounds
`Focus strictly on <section>. Name exactly 1 structural weakness. Give the smallest strong fix. Return only: consultant_verdict, strongest_finding, weakest_or_vague_finding, proposed_fix, confidence. No praise. No preamble.`

### Narrow synthesis fallback — only when the caller explicitly requests decision-ready compaction
`Focus strictly on <section>. Given the current SELF_POSITION and the consultant critique, output only: relation, decision, next_action. No praise. No preamble.`

Rules:
- In consultant-bearing rounds, narrowing should default to consultant-position output, not direct final decision output.
- Decision-style narrowing is allowed only at synthesis time, not as the consultant's default role.

## Safety stop
Stop only when all of these are true:
- the consultant explicitly says another round is not worth it
- you agree
- no accepted but unpatched fix remains
- no must-have docs or tests remain for the asked scope
- no unresolved blocker remains for the asked scope
