# Packaging Checklist — super-memori

Before setting publish-ready state, confirm:
- [x] Package root contains `SKILL.md`
- [x] Package root contains `_meta.json`
- [x] Package root contains `.clawhubignore`
- [x] Package root contains `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] Package root contains `PACKAGING_CHECKLIST.md`
- [x] Package root contains required public entrypoints: `query-memory.sh`, `memorize.sh`, `index-memory.sh`, `health-check.sh`
- [x] Maintenance-only entrypoints are present and documented without being mistaken for weak-model public commands: `audit-memory.sh`, `repair-memory.sh`, `list-promotion-candidates.sh`, `validate-release.sh`
- [x] Package root contains required runtime helper code under `scripts/`
- [x] Package root contains required references used by the skill
- [x] Publish evidence files exist under `references/verification-evidence.md` and `references/reference-test-log.md`
- [x] `.clawhubignore` excludes transient/local state (`.clawhub/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.tmp`, `*.pending`, `*.lock`, `.index_state`, `backups/`, full `reports/` review artifacts, `reports/test-generated/`, and root temporary validation leftovers such as `tmp_round2_strict.txt`)
- [x] Skill heading version matches `_meta.json`
- [x] Release health policy is explicit: `FAIL` blocks publish; `WARN` is allowed only when it reflects documented optional/degraded host conditions and the release surface does not imply semantic-ready or fully healthy baseline
- [x] If release proceeds while the reference host is in `WARN`, the qualification is recorded deterministically from observed health-check fields/state, not free-text intuition alone
- [x] If release proceeds while the reference host is in `WARN`, `CHANGELOG.md` explains why that WARN is still compatible with honest publication
- [x] Stable promotion is blocked until an equipped host passes `references/stable-host-readiness.md`; candidate publication may proceed with explicit host-state qualification
- [x] No fake `.clawhub/origin.json` is created before a real publish; publish metadata is synced only after actual ClawHub publication
