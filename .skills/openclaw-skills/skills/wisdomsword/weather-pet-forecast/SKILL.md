# Weather Pet Forecast 🐕

Get a comprehensive 3-day weather forecast with warm, caring recommendations for both humans and their beloved pets. Perfect for pet owners who want to plan outdoor activities with their furry friends!

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "Check the weather for the next few days"
- "What's the weather forecast for today, tomorrow, and the day after?"
- "Give me a weather analysis"
- "Should I plan outdoor activities this week?"
- "Will I need an umbrella in the next few days?"
- "Is it safe to walk my dog today?"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Location

Ask for location if not provided. Accept:
- City names: "Beijing", "London", "New York"
- City + Country: "Paris, France"
- Airport codes: "PEK", "LAX", "JFK"

### Step 2: Fetch 3-Day Weather Data

Use wttr.in to get forecast data:

```bash
# JSON format for parsing (recommended)
curl -s "wttr.in/{LOCATION}?format=j1"

# Human-readable 3-day forecast
curl -s "wttr.in/{LOCATION}"
```

Extract key data for each day:
- **Today** (day 0): Current + today's forecast
- **Tomorrow** (day 1): Full day forecast
- **Day After** (day 2): Full day forecast

### Step 3: Parse Weather Data

From JSON response, extract for each day:

**Temperature:**
- Max temperature (`maxtempC` or `maxtempF`)
- Min temperature (`mintempC` or `mintempF`)
- Average temperature (`avgtempC` or `avgtempF`)

**Conditions:**
- Weather description (`weatherDesc`)
- Precipitation probability (`hourly[].chanceofrain`)
- Humidity (`humidity`)

**Wind:**
- Wind speed (`windspeedKmph` or `windspeedMiles`)
- Wind direction (`winddir16Point`)

**Additional:**
- UV index (`uvIndex`)
- Visibility (`visibility`)
- Sunrise/Sunset times

### Step 4: Analyze Weather Trends

Perform comparative analysis across the 3 days:

**Temperature Trend:**
- Rising 📈, Falling 📉, or Stable ➡️
- Note significant changes (>5°C swing)

**Precipitation Analysis:**
- Rain probability for each day
- Identify wet days (>50% chance)
- Recommend rain gear timing

**Weather Patterns:**
- Identify improving or deteriorating conditions
- Note any severe weather warnings
- Highlight ideal windows for outdoor activities

### Step 5: Generate Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis, provide actionable advice:

**🌡️ Temperature Comfort:**
- Dress recommendations (layers, warm clothing, etc.)
- Indoor vs outdoor activity suggestions

**🌧️ Rain & Precipitation:**
- Umbrella necessity
- Best times for outdoor activities
- Indoor alternatives for rainy days

### Step 6: Pet-Friendly Analysis

Provide specialized recommendations for pet owners:

**🐕 Pet Temperature Safety:**
- High temperature (>30°C): Avoid midday walks, choose early morning or evening
- Warm weather (25-30°C): Shorter outdoor time, bring water
- Cold weather (<0°C): Short-haired dogs need clothing, limit outdoor time
