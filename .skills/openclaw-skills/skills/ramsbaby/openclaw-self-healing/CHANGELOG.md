## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Cursor removed:** Cursor support was not implemented, removed to avoid confusion

- **Honest documentation:** Clearly marked Aider as "experimental" (needs real-world testing)

### Changed
- Log file naming: `claude-session-*.log` → `ai-session-*.log` (agent-agnostic)
- Aider startup wait: 3s (vs Claude's 5s)
- Priority order simplified: Claude Code → Aider (Cursor removed)
- Metrics now include agent name for tracking

### Improved
