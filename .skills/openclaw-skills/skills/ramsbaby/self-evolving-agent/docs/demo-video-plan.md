# 🎬 Self-Evolving Agent v4.0 — Demo Video Plan

> **Created:** 2026-02-18  
> **Purpose:** Complete production plan for 3 demo formats targeting different audiences  
> **Product:** Self-Evolving Agent v4.0 — 5-stage multi-agent pipeline that reads AI logs, proposes AGENTS.md improvements, and measures whether those improvements actually worked.

---

## 🎯 Core Narrative (The Hook)

> *"Your AI makes the same mistake every week. You correct it. It forgets. Self-Evolving Agent closes that loop — and tells you whether the fix actually worked."*

**The emotional arc across all videos:**
1. **Pain** → "The AI keeps repeating mistakes"
2. **Discovery** → "There's a 5-stage pipeline running every Sunday"
3. **Proof** → "119 consecutive exec retries — caught automatically"
4. **Measurement** → "The fix worked: −45% ✅"
5. **Safety** → "You approve everything. Always."

### Detailed Script — Video 2

#### **[0:00–0:45] HOOK — The Repeating Mistake Problem**
**Visual:** Screen recording of actual Discord chat (sanitized)

**Script (narration):**
> *"Here's a real conversation with my AI assistant. Monday — I tell it to stop splitting messages. Tuesday — it splits messages again. Next Monday — same correction. I was manually updating a file called AGENTS.md — basically a rulebook for the AI — but I could only add rules I noticed. And I had no way to know if those rules were actually working."*
> 
> *"That's the problem this tool solves."*

**Terminal:** Show the AGENTS.md file briefly
```bash
cat ~/openclaw/AGENTS.md | head -30
# → Shows: "🚫 메시지 단편화 금지 (Discord 필수 규칙)"
```

---

#### **[0:45–2:00] VERSION HISTORY — Credibility Building**
**Visual:** Timeline graphic (Excalidraw export or simple animated slide)

**Script:**
> *"Version 1 was a grep script. It keyword-searched chat logs for frustration signals like 'again' and 'you forgot'. It worked — but 40% false positive rate. The AI itself says 'again' all the time. No way to tell who's frustrated."*

> *"Version 2 added exec retry detection. That's when I found 119 consecutive retries in one session. The AI had looped itself trying the same command 119 times. Nobody noticed."*

> *"Version 3 added session health metrics and cleaned up the output. But the fundamental problem remained: I'd apply a proposal, and have no idea if it helped."*

> *"Version 4 closes that loop."*

**Show:** Simple before/after table on screen
```
v3.0: Propose → Apply → ???
v4.0: Propose → Apply → Measure → Report → Propose again
```

---

#### **[2:00–4:30] ARCHITECTURE WALKTHROUGH**
**Visual:** Mix of Excalidraw diagram + live file tree + script reading

**Step 1: Show file structure**
```bash
tree ~/openclaw/skills/self-evolving-agent/scripts/v4/
# Output:
# scripts/v4/
# ├── orchestrator.sh         ← Entry point
# ├── collect-logs.sh         ← Stage 1
# ├── semantic-analyze.sh     ← Stage 2
# ├── benchmark.sh            ← Stage 3
# ├── measure-effects.sh      ← Stage 4
# └── synthesize-proposal.sh  ← Stage 5 (only one with API call)
```

**Step 2: Show data flow — read Stage 1 output**
```bash
# Show what Stage 1 produces
cat ~/openclaw/skills/self-evolving-agent/data/collect-sample.json | jq '.'
# → Show: session count, retry events, error patterns
```

**Step 3: Show role filter in action — the key v4.0 improvement**
```bash
# Open semantic-analyze.sh and show role_filter code
grep -A 10 "role_filter" ~/openclaw/skills/self-evolving-agent/scripts/v4/semantic-analyze.sh
```
**Narration:**
> *"This is the role filter — the change that cut false positives from 40% to 15%. The AI says 'again' and 'retry' constantly. By filtering to user messages only, we only catch the human expressing frustration."*

**Step 4: Show benchmark.sh — the closed feedback loop**
```bash
cat ~/openclaw/skills/self-evolving-agent/data/benchmarks/benchmark-sample.json | jq '.proposals'
# → Shows: proposal #2 effective (-45%), proposal #3 neutral
```

---

#### **[4:30–6:30] LIVE PIPELINE EXECUTION**
**Visual:** Full asciinema recording of the orchestrator running — no cuts, real time (or 1.5× speed)

```bash
# Start the full pipeline
bash ~/openclaw/skills/self-evolving-agent/scripts/v4/orchestrator.sh

# Pause narration at each stage to explain what's happening
```

**Stage-by-stage narration (as pipeline runs):**

- **Stage 1 (Collect):** *"The collector scans 7 days of session transcripts. It finds 964 total sessions, samples 30 by error density — so the heaviest sessions get more attention."*
- **Stage 2 (Analyze):** *"The analyzer runs both keyword matching and structural heuristics. It checks the context window — 3 lines before and after each keyword — to reduce false positives."*
- **Stage 3 (Benchmark):** *"This is the new part. It loads last week's proposals and checks whether the target patterns decreased. Proposal #2 dropped 45%. That's the feedback loop."*
- **Stage 4 (Measure Effects):** *"Deep frequency analysis — not just count, but trajectory. Is the problem getting better week-over-week, or bouncing back?"*
- **Stage 5 (Synthesize):** *"One Claude API call. It gets structured JSON from the first four stages and writes a markdown proposal with before/after diffs. Total cost: about half a cent."*

**v3.0 vs v4.0 Real Numbers Table:**
```
┌────────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐

│ Effect measurement     │ Manual       │ Automatic ✅ │
└────────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Real case study:**
> *"Here's a real number. After applying proposal #2 — the exec retry limit rule — the 'repeat command' pattern dropped from 22 occurrences to 12. That's a 45% reduction, measured automatically by the benchmark agent one week later."*

**Show:** Screenshot of the actual benchmark JSON result

---

#### **[7:30–8:30] DISCORD OUTPUT + APPROVAL GATE**
**Visual:** Real Discord notification screenshot + scroll through proposal

**What to show:**
1. Discord DM/channel notification appearing
2. Full proposal message (scrolled slowly)
3. Zoom into approval commands
4. Type: `apply proposal #1` → show what happens
5. Show: `rejected-proposals.json` — rejection memory

**Narration:**
> *"The AI doesn't decide what changes to your rules. You do. Every proposal requires an explicit approval. Rejections are logged — the system won't re-propose the same change. After 3 similar rejections, it marks that pattern as a user preference and stops suggesting it."*

---

#### **[8:30–9:30] HONEST LIMITS**
**Visual:** Simple text list on dark background

**Script:**
> *"What doesn't it do? It's not true semantic understanding — it's structured heuristics. Not embeddings. There's still a ~15% false positive rate. If the complaint pattern isn't in your config.yaml, it won't find it. The benchmark is frequency-based correlation, not causation. And the first 2-4 weeks have almost no data — cold start problem."*

> *"I'm telling you this because I'd rather you know before you try it than after."*

**Show:** The limitations table from README.md rendered cleanly

---

#### **[9:30–10:00] OUTRO + CTA**
**Visual:** Terminal typing the star command, then GitHub page

**Script:**
> *"Two commands to install. Less than 5 cents a week. Full source code — 400 lines of shell scripts you can read in 15 minutes. If your AI keeps making the same mistakes, this is worth trying."*

## 📤 Upload Strategy

### YouTube — Deep Dive Video

**Title (A/B test these):**
```
Option A: "Self-Evolving Agent v4.0: AI That Fixes Its Own Mistakes (With Proof)"
Option B: "I Built a 5-Stage Pipeline to Find 119 Hidden AI Bugs. Here's What It Found."
Option C: "How I Automated My AI's Rulebook (And Measure Whether It's Working)"
```

**Description template:**
```
Self-Evolving Agent v4.0 — a 5-stage multi-agent pipeline that reads your AI 
assistant's logs, finds patterns of repeated mistakes, and proposes evidence-based 
rule changes to your AGENTS.md. Most importantly: it measures whether those changes 
actually worked.

⏱️ Timestamps:
0:00  The problem — same mistakes every week
0:45  Version history (v1 → v4)
2:00  Architecture walkthrough
4:30  Live pipeline execution
6:30  Before/after comparison
7:30  Discord output + approval gate
8:30  Honest limitations
9:30  Install (2 commands)

📊 Real numbers from this video:
• 964 sessions analyzed in one week
• 405 exec retry events detected
• 119 max consecutive retries (one session!)
• False positives: ~40% (v3.0) → ~15% (v4.0)
• Cost: < $0.05/week with Claude Sonnet

### Reddit Post Strategy

**r/selfhosted post template:**
```
Title: I built a weekly pipeline that reads my AI's logs and tells me what's broken 
       (with before/after measurement). Open source.

[GIF of pipeline running]

The problem: my AI assistant kept repeating the same mistakes week after week.
I'd correct it manually — but had no way to know if the fix actually worked.

So I built Self-Evolving Agent v4.0: 5 specialized agents that run every Sunday,
analyze 7 days of logs, and propose evidence-based rule changes. Most importantly:
the next week it tells you whether your fix was EFFECTIVE (-45%) or NEUTRAL (+2%).

Real numbers from my instance:
- 405 exec retry events found in one week
- 119 max consecutive retries (the AI looped itself, nobody noticed)
- False positives: down from 40% → 15% with role filtering

It proposes. You decide. Always.

**Subreddits to target:**
1. r/selfhosted — "runs on your own machine, analyzes your own logs"
2. r/MachineLearning — "closed feedback loop for AI improvement"
3. r/devops — "5-stage pipeline, shell scripts, cron-based"
4. r/programming — "technical architecture deep dive"
5. r/LocalLLM — "local-first, only 1 API call"
6. r/ChatGPT / r/ClaudeAI — "makes AI assistants better"

- [ ] Install tools: `brew install asciinema agg vhs gifsicle`
- [ ] Export Excalidraw/Mermaid diagrams as PNG/SVG

### Recording
- [ ] **GIF (Video 3)** — record first (shortest, easiest to iterate)
  - [ ] Install: `asciinema rec /tmp/install.cast`
  - [ ] Pipeline run: `asciinema rec /tmp/pipeline.cast`
- [ ] **Quick Demo (Video 1)** — record second
  - [ ] Hook screen recording (split screen problem/solution)
  - [ ] Pipeline asciinema recording
  - [ ] Discord screenshot screen recording
- [ ] **Deep Dive (Video 2)** — record last (most complex)
  - [ ] OBS setup and test
  - [ ] Architecture walkthrough (slides + terminal)
  - [ ] Live pipeline execution (full, uncut or 1.5×)
  - [ ] Discord approval demo

### Post-Production
- [ ] Edit in DaVinci Resolve or iMovie
- [ ] Add text overlays/annotations
- [ ] Add background music (-18dB)
- [ ] Export: 1080p MP4 for Videos 1&2, optimized GIF for Video 3
