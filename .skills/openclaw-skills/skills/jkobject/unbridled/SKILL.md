# unbridled

Unified messaging for agents via a personal Beeper account.

## What it does

- Connects to the user's **Beeper Cloud** account (`https://matrix.beeper.com/_hungryserv/<user>`).
- Uses the **hungryserv Matrix homeserver** that Beeper exposes per-user.
- Reads / sends messages across all networks bridged inside Beeper (Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Signal, Telegram, Discord, Google Messages, …).
- Handles **Olm/Megolm E2EE** via `matrix-nio[e2e]`.
- Bootstraps **cross-signing** from the user's Beeper Recovery Key, so Beeper's bridges trust the agent's device and actually relay messages to the external networks.

Under the hood it is a thin, dependency-minimal layer:

```
agent / clawd
    │
    │ CLI / Python import
    ▼
scripts/
    ├── nio_client.py          ← async send / list / history (E2EE)
    ├── client.py              ← sync HTTP wrapper (no e2ee; list + bridge state)
    ├── bootstrap_crosssign.py ← one-shot: recovery key → cross-sign device
    ├── import_key_backup.py   ← one-shot: recovery key → import Megolm key backup
    ├── sync_daemon.py         ← long-running sync (systemd) → new Megolm sessions
    └── verify_interactive.py  ← fallback: SAS verification via Beeper Desktop
    ▼
bbctl + access token (~/.config/bbctl/config.json)
    ▼
https://matrix.beeper.com/_hungryserv/<user>   (Matrix CS API)
    ▼
Beeper bridges (cloud) → Messenger / WhatsApp / IG / LinkedIn / Twitter / …
```

## When to use this skill

Use **beeper-matrix** when the user asks to:
- Send a Messenger / WhatsApp / IG / LinkedIn / Twitter DM from an agent context.
- Read or search their chats across networks.
- Build a recap, auto-reply, digest, or cron job that touches personal chats.

Do **not** use it to blast messages to many contacts or to automate replies without explicit consent per-thread.

## Prerequisites (user-side)

The user must have:
1. A **Beeper account** (beeper.com) with the desired networks bridged (Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.).
2. Their **Beeper Recovery Key** — a phrase like `EsUC HBcy scrf uiTy DTU2 rvEB Jmgj 9Cpa D6V2 z7Vk ZrU9 9RMh`.

### Where to find the Beeper Recovery Key

In **Beeper Desktop**:
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Click on **your name** at the top
3. Click the **arrow (⌄)** next to your name to expand
4. Click **"Show Recovery Code"**

The code is shown as 12 groups of 4 base58 characters.

⚠️ It's a full account recovery secret — treat it like a password. If it's ever exposed, regenerate it from the same menu.

## Prerequisites (host-side, agent)

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu 24.04). macOS should work too.
- `python3` with `venv`
- `uv` (or plain `pip`) to create the venv
- `libolm-dev` (package for Olm/Megolm crypto)
- `ffmpeg` (optional, for media attachments later)

## Setup (one-time, ~5 min)

Follow these steps once on the agent host.

### 1. Install `bbctl` and deps

```bash
# bbctl binary (Beeper Bridge Manager)
mkdir -p ~/bin
curl -sL -o ~/bin/bbctl https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager/releases/latest/download/bbctl-linux-amd64
chmod +x ~/bin/bbctl

# System deps
sudo apt install -y libolm-dev ffmpeg python3-venv

# Agent Python venv (dedicated, not global)
uv venv ~/.venvs/beeper --python 3.12
VIRTUAL_ENV=~/.venvs/beeper uv pip install 'matrix-nio[e2e]' aiohttp pycryptodome cryptography pynacl unpaddedbase64 canonicaljson
```

### 2. Log into Beeper from `bbctl`

```bash
bbctl login
```

The user enters their Beeper credentials. This stores an access token at `~/.config/bbctl/config.json`. That token is all the nio client needs.

Verify:
```bash
bbctl whoami
# Should show: User ID: @<user>:beeper.com, all bridges RUNNING
```

### 3. Save the Beeper Recovery Key

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.secrets && chmod 700 ~/.secrets
cat > ~/.secrets/beeper-recovery-key.txt <<EOF
EsUC HBcy scrf uiTy DTU2 rvEB Jmgj 9Cpa D6V2 z7Vk ZrU9 9RMh
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.secrets/beeper-recovery-key.txt
```

Replace the sample with the actual recovery key. Never commit to git.

### 4. Copy skill scripts into place

The 4 scripts live at `scripts/beeper/` in the workspace (they come with the skill — see `scripts/` subfolder). Ensure:

```bash
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/beeper/
# client.py  nio_client.py  bootstrap_crosssign.py  verify_interactive.py
```

### 5. Bootstrap nio store + cross-sign the device

```bash
# First run initializes the Olm store (~/.local/share/clawd-matrix/)
~/.venvs/beeper/bin/python ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/beeper/nio_client.py whoami
# Should print: e2ee: enabled=True

# Sign the device using the recovery key
~/.venvs/beeper/bin/python ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/beeper/bootstrap_crosssign.py
# Expected output ends with:
#   🎉 SUCCESS — device is now cross-signed. Bridge should accept our messages.
```

After this step, Beeper's bridges trust the agent's device and will relay messages to the external networks.

### 6. Import the Matrix key backup (required for reading history)

Cross-signing only handles *outgoing* messages. To decrypt *incoming* history,
import the server-side Megolm key backup into the local Olm store. Stop the
sync daemon first to avoid a write conflict on the sqlite store.

```bash
systemctl --user stop clawd-beeper-sync 2>/dev/null || true
~/.venvs/beeper/bin/python ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/beeper/import_key_backup.py
systemctl --user start clawd-beeper-sync
# Expected: "✓ Imported N sessions into ~/.local/share/clawd-matrix/"
```

You only need to run this once per device (sessions accumulate in the store).
Re-run it after any `bbctl login` that issued a new device id.

## Daily usage

All commands run inside the venv. `$SKILL_DIR` is wherever this skill is
installed (e.g. `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/unbridled` when installed via
ClawHub, or the repo root if cloned from GitHub).

```bash
NIO=~/.venvs/beeper/bin/python
SCRIPT="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/nio_client.py"

# Identity check
$NIO $SCRIPT whoami

# List chats for a specific network (shows room name, which is often missing for DMs)
$NIO $SCRIPT list-chats --network messenger --limit 25
$NIO $SCRIPT list-chats --network whatsapp  --limit 50
$NIO $SCRIPT list-chats --network linkedin

# Aliases accepted: messenger/facebook/fb, whatsapp/wa, instagram/ig,
# linkedin, twitter/x, signal, telegram, discord

# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: DMs on Beeper usually have NO room name (listed as !xxx:beeper.local).
# The contact name lives in a member's display_name. To find a chat by contact, use:
$NIO $SCRIPT search-chats baptiste                     # scans all 344 rooms + members
$NIO $SCRIPT search-chats juliette --network messenger # restrict to one bridge
$NIO $SCRIPT search-chats "jean-baptiste" --json        # structured output

# Send a message (E2EE handled automatically)
$NIO $SCRIPT send --room '!xxx:beeper.local' --text "Hello from clawd"

# Read recent history in a room (requires megolm session in the store)
$NIO $SCRIPT history --room '!xxx:beeper.local' --limit 20
```

Python import usage (recommended for cron / scripts):

```python
import os, sys, asyncio
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser(os.environ["SKILL_DIR"]) + "/scripts")
from nio_client import make_client

async def ping():
    c = await make_client()
    try:
        # ... use c.room_send / c.joined_rooms / etc.
        pass
    finally:
        await c.close()

asyncio.run(ping())
```

## Quirks to know about

- **Lazy sync**: Beeper hungryserv doesn't ship all rooms on `sync(full_state=True)`. nio's `client.rooms` will be mostly empty. The wrapper sidesteps this by calling `joined_rooms()` directly and manually injecting a minimal `MatrixRoom` before `room_send`. Don't rely on `client.rooms` being complete.
- **Lots of decryption warnings**: nio tries to decrypt every event across all 300+ rooms during sync and prints warnings for rooms where the group session is missing. The wrapper silences them via `logging.getLogger("nio").setLevel(ERROR)`.
- **Schema warning flood** (`'events' is a required property`): hungryserv returns sync responses with fields nio doesn't fully recognize. Safe to ignore; already silenced.
- **Bridge trust**: without cross-signing, Beeper bridges reject outgoing messages with `com.beeper.undecryptable_event` / `your device is not trusted (unverified)`. `bootstrap_crosssign.py` fixes this once and for all for this device.
- **"Notes to self" chats don't relay**: the `Facebook Messenger (Jérémie Kalfon)` auto-chat has no external recipient. Test sends on a chat with a real other user.
- **First message to a new chat**: may take 1-2 seconds extra as nio establishes the Megolm group session.
- **Small recent-activity counts can be misleading**: when a room has only 1 recent raw Matrix event, that event may be a reaction or bridge/meta event rather than the actual text message. Digest/collector code should over-fetch (`history --limit >= 10`) instead of mirroring the raw count, otherwise it can report a false `decryption unavailable`.
- **Recovery key != SSH key**: this is a secret that lets *anyone with it* impersonate the user on all Beeper-bridged networks. Handle accordingly.

## Safety rules for the agent

This skill gives the agent direct write access to the user's personal chats
on every bridged network. The agent MUST treat every `send` as a privileged
operation:

- **Never send a DM on a new thread without explicit user confirmation.**
  One-line acks like "go ahead" count; inferred intent does not.
- **Never mass-send or loop over contacts.** Even mundane messages become
  spam at N≥3 recipients; users get banned from WhatsApp / Messenger for this.
- **In group chats, the agent is not the user's voice.** Stay silent unless
  directly addressed by name. If unsure, don't post.
- **Never paraphrase emotional/sensitive messages on the user's behalf** —
  show the draft to the user first and let them approve or rewrite.
- **Never forward messages from one private thread into another** without
  explicit permission.
- **Log every outgoing send** in the workspace journal (e.g.
  `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) so the user can audit after the fact.
- **Respect quiet hours.** Midnight sends look like the user is chaotic,
  not like an assistant is helpful.
- **Never share or paste the recovery key, access token, or Olm store path**
  in any external output (message bodies, issues, logs the user didn't ask
  for). These are the keys to the whole kingdom.
- **If the user revokes the Beeper session** (logout device), the Olm store
  becomes stale — re-run `bootstrap_crosssign.py` and `import_key_backup.py`
  after the next `bbctl login`.

## Status

- v0.2.2 — 2026-04-21 — Fix packaged-skill path resolution in `collect_beeper_daily.py` (`scripts/client.py` and `scripts/nio_client.py` live next to the collector, not under `scripts/beeper/`). Validated by running the collector directly from the published skill layout.
- v0.2.1 — 2026-04-21 — Fix false `decryption unavailable` in `collect_beeper_daily.py` by over-fetching a small history window instead of using the raw recent-event count as the decrypt limit. Validated on Messenger + WhatsApp groups where the latest raw event was reaction/meta noise.
- v0.2.0 — 2026-04-18 — Full send + read across Messenger / WhatsApp / IG / LinkedIn / Twitter after `import_key_backup.py` was added. Confirmed decrypting >95% of joined rooms on an active Beeper account (357/357 backup sessions imported, 0 errors).
- v0.1.0 — 2026-04-18 — Works for send on cross-signed device. History (megolm decrypt) partial.

## Inbound decryption — key backup + sync daemon

Two complementary mechanisms feed Megolm group sessions into the local Olm
store so inbound history can be decrypted:

1. **Matrix key backup** (`m.megolm_backup.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2`): Beeper
   keeps a server-side, encrypted-at-rest backup of every Megolm session the
   user has ever held. `import_key_backup.py` downloads those, decrypts them
   with the recovery key (same key used for cross-signing), and injects each
   one into the nio sqlite store. One-shot, imports the entire history.
2. **Live sync daemon** (`sync_daemon.py`, systemd-supervised): runs
   `sync_forever` against hungryserv. Beeper's bridges push new sessions via
   `to_device` events as they're created, which the daemon stores. Keeps
   everything up-to-date for future messages.

After the one-shot backup import and a minute or two of the daemon running,
`history` and `collect_beeper_daily.py` decrypt nearly all traffic. Coverage
is typically ≥ 95% of joined rooms (the rest being inactive rooms that had
no session in the backup).

Install:
```bash
bash systemd/install.sh
systemctl --user enable --now clawd-beeper-sync.service
systemctl --user status clawd-beeper-sync
journalctl --user -u clawd-beeper-sync -f
```

Resource footprint: ~35 MB RAM idle, negligible CPU.

## Roadmap

- [ ] `unread --network X` helper (summarize unread chats)
- [ ] `reply --to <event_id>` with proper Matrix reply threading
- [ ] `mark-read` on inbound messages
- [ ] Media / attachments (image send)
- [ ] Publish v1.0 on ClawHub
