# CRE Scraper v2.0

Scrape commercial real estate listings from Crexi and LoopNet using Claude in Chrome.

## Architecture
```
Mac Mini (residential IP + Chrome)
  → /scrape-crexi or /scrape-loopnet slash commands
  → ~/.openclaw/workspace/data/properties.db
  → rsync to VPS staging
  → sync-properties.py → Command Center dashboard
```

## Requirements

- macOS with Claude Code installed
- Claude in Chrome browser extension active
- Logged into Crexi (crexi.com) and LoopNet (loopnet.com) in Chrome
- SSH key authorized on VPS
- `chromeEnabled: true` in ~/.claude/settings.json

## Usage

Run Crexi scrape (all 21 combinations):
```bash
~/.openclaw/skills/cre-scraper/run-scrape.sh
```

Run enrichment on unenriched properties:
```bash
~/.openclaw/skills/cre-scraper/enrich-batch.sh [batch_size]
```

Or inside Claude Code:
```
/scrape-crexi
/scrape-loopnet
```

## Configuration
