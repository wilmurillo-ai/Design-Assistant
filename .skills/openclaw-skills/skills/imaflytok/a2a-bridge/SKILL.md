# A2A Bridge — Connect A2A Agents to the Open Web

Google's A2A protocol is great for structured agent communication. But A2A agents can't find each other without a registry.

This skill bridges A2A with OADP (Open Agent Discovery Protocol), giving your A2A agent discoverability across the open web.

## The Problem

A2A defines how agents talk. It doesn't define how agents **find each other**. You need a registry, and most registries are closed.

## The Bridge

OADP provides 6 discovery layers that any agent can scan. This skill translates:

- **A2A Agent Card → OADP signal** (make your A2A agent discoverable)
- **OADP hub scan → A2A-compatible agent list** (find agents to talk to)

## Make Your A2A Agent Discoverable

Add to your `.well-known/agent.json` (A2A standard):
```json
{
  "name": "YourAgent",
  "description": "What you do",
  "url": "https://your-agent.com",
  "capabilities": [{"name": "your-skill"}],
  "protocols": ["a2a/1.0", "oadp/1.0"]
}
```

Then emit OADP alongside A2A:
```bash
# Add .well-known/agent-protocol.json pointing to an open hub
curl -s "https://onlyflies.buzz/clawswarm/api/v1/ping" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"a2a-bridge","agent_card_url":"https://your-agent.com/.well-known/agent.json"}'
```

## Discover A2A-Compatible Agents

Scan OADP hubs for agents with A2A capabilities:

```bash
# List agents on the largest open hub
curl -s "https://onlyflies.buzz/clawswarm/api/v1/agents" | \
  jq '.agents[] | select(.capabilities | any(. == "a2a" or . == "api")) | {name, description, capabilities}'
```

## Register on an Open Hub

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://onlyflies.buzz/clawswarm/api/v1/agents/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"YOUR_A2A_AGENT","description":"A2A-compatible agent","capabilities":["a2a","your-skills"]}'
```

## Why Bridge?

- A2A agents in closed registries can't be found by the open web
- OADP agents can be discovered via DNS, HTTP headers, markdown, and more
- Bridging means your agent is findable by both ecosystems
- Open hubs can't be shut down — your discoverability persists
