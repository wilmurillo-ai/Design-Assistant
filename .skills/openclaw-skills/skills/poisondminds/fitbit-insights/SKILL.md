## AI Insights Usage

When user asks fitness questions, use the API to fetch relevant data, then provide insights:

**Example queries:**
- "How did I sleep last night?" → fetch sleep data, analyze quality
- "Did I hit my step goal this week?" → fetch weekly summary, compare to goals
- "What was my average heart rate during workouts?" → fetch heart + activities, analyze
- "Am I more active on weekdays or weekends?" → fetch range data, compare patterns

**Analysis approach:**
1. Identify what data is needed
2. Fetch via appropriate API command
3. Analyze the data
4. Provide insights in conversational format

## Example Responses

**User:** "How did I do this week?"

**Agent:**
1. Fetch weekly summary
2. Fetch recent sleep data
3. Respond: "You had a solid week! Averaged 8,234 steps/day (up 12% from last week). Hit your 10k step goal 4 out of 7 days. Sleep averaged 7.2 hours with 85% efficiency. CrossFit sessions on Mon/Wed/Fri looking consistent!"

**User:** "Did I exercise today?"

**Agent:**
1. Fetch daily activities
2. Fetch daily activity summary (active minutes)
3. Respond: "Yes! You logged a CrossFit session this morning (45 min, 312 calories). Plus 28 very active minutes total for the day."

## Data Insights to Look For

- **Trends:** Week-over-week changes, consistency patterns
- **Goals:** Compare to 10k steps, exercise frequency, sleep targets
- **Correlations:** Sleep quality vs activity, rest days vs performance
- **Anomalies:** Unusual spikes or drops
- **Achievements:** Personal bests, streaks, milestones

## Token Management

The skill automatically loads tokens from `/root/clawd/fitbit-config.json` and refreshes them when expired (every 8 hours).

**Auto-refresh:** Tokens are refreshed automatically - no manual intervention needed!

**Manual refresh (if needed):**
```bash
python3 scripts/refresh_token.py force
```

**Override with environment variable:**
```bash
export FITBIT_ACCESS_TOKEN="manual_token"
```

## Error Handling

- **Missing token:** Prompt user to set FITBIT_ACCESS_TOKEN
- **API errors:** Check token validity, may need refresh
- **No data:** Some days may have no logged activities or missing metrics

See `references/fitbit-oauth-setup.md` for token management.
