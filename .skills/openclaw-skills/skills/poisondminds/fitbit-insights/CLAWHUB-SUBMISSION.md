## Short Description (1 line)

AI-powered Fitbit insights with natural language Q&A - ask about your fitness, get intelligent answers.

## Long Description

Fitbit Fitness Insights brings AI-powered analysis to your fitness data. Instead of checking graphs and numbers in the Fitbit app, simply ask questions and get conversational insights.

**Key Features:**
- 🤖 Natural language Q&A - "How did I sleep?" "Did I hit my goals?"
- 📊 Activity insights - Steps, calories, active minutes, distance
- 💓 Heart rate analysis - Resting HR, zones, workout intensity
- 😴 Sleep tracking - Duration, efficiency, wake-ups, sleep stages
- 🏃 Workout analysis - Logged activities, duration, calories
- 📈 Trend detection - Week-over-week, patterns, achievements

**How It Works:**
1. Ask your AI assistant fitness questions
2. Skill fetches data from Fitbit API
3. AI analyzes and generates insights
4. Get conversational answers, not just numbers

**Example Conversations:**

*"How did I sleep last night?"*
→ "You slept 7.9 hours with 96% efficiency. Only woke up twice for 2 minutes total. That's excellent sleep quality! 😴"

*"How active was I this week?"*
→ "You averaged 8,234 steps/day (up 12% from last week!). Hit your 10k goal 4/7 days. CrossFit 3x with 156 very active minutes. Solid week! 💪"

**Perfect for:**
- Fitness enthusiasts who want deeper insights
- People tracking health goals
- Anyone tired of checking the Fitbit app constantly
- Those who prefer conversational data over charts
