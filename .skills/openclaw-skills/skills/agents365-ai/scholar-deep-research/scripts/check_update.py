"""check_update.py — check for and apply skill updates.

Runs once per 24 hours at Phase 0 Step 0. Fast-forwards the skill's git
checkout against its upstream remote when an update is available, and
surfaces what happened through the standard JSON envelope so SKILL.md
can tell the user in one line.

The throttle (24h, via `.last_update_check` timestamp in the skill
root) mirrors the asta-skill pattern: a research session should not
spend a network round-trip every single time the skill activates —
daily is enough for git fast-forwards, and the user can always pass
`--force` to bypass the throttle when they know something upstream
changed.

Design constraints (see CLAUDE.md, "The CLI contract"):
  - Never fails the workflow. Any error (offline, no remote, dirty tree,
    non-git install) becomes a structured envelope with exit 0.
  - Respects SCHOLAR_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1 as an opt-out escape hatch for
    users who want to pin a version.
  - Honors --ff-only semantics: local modifications are never clobbered.
    When the working tree is dirty the update is skipped and the user is
    informed, so they know auto-update did not run.
  - Does not pip-install. Detects requirements.txt drift and surfaces a
    hint; the host environment (which venv, which python) is the user's
    to manage, not this script's.
  - The only script in this repo allowed to touch the skill's own files.

Action values:
  up_to_date         local HEAD == upstream HEAD
  updated            fast-forward pull succeeded
  update_available   --dry-run only; pull would succeed
  skipped_dirty      working tree has uncommitted changes
  skipped_disabled   SCHOLAR_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK is set
  skipped_throttled  last check was within the 24h throttle window
  not_a_git_repo     installed without .git (tarball, package manager)
  check_failed       git/network error; `reason` field explains
