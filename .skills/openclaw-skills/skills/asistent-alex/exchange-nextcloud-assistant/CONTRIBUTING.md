# Contributing to OpenClaw IMM-Romania

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Development Standards

This project follows the [Hardshell Coding Standards](https://github.com/asistent-alex/openclaw-hardshell).

### Quick Reference

- **Security**: Validate all input, no secrets in code, HTTPS everywhere
- **Architecture**: SOLID principles, separation of concerns
- **Testing**: TDD with 70% minimum coverage
- **Git**: Conventional commits, feature branches

## Running Checks

```bash
# Format code
black modules/ tests/

# Lint
ruff check modules/ tests/

# Type check (optional)
mypy modules/

# Run tests
PYTHONPATH=modules/exchange pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage
PYTHONPATH=modules/exchange pytest tests/ --cov=modules --cov-report=html
```

## Branch Strategy

- `main` - always deployable, protected
- `feature/<slug>` - short-lived feature branches
- `fix/<slug>` - bug fix branches
- `alpha-testing` - integration testing

## Commit Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
```

Examples:
- `feat(mail): add attachment support`
- `fix(calendar): handle timezone correctly`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## Pull Request Process
