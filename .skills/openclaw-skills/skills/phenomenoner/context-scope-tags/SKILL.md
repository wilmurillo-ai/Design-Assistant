# Context Scope Tags (Chat Protocol)

A lightweight, portable convention for **explicit context boundaries** in chat.

## Copy/paste cheat sheet (one screen)

- `[ISO: <topic>]` fresh slate for this message (no prior project/topic context)
- `[SCOPE: <topic>]` restrict to one named scope
- `[GLOBAL]` cross-topic reuse allowed (call out what was reused)
- `[NOMEM]` do not store long-term memory from this exchange
- `[REM]` persist preferences/decisions (requires a memory backend; otherwise advisory)

Examples:
- `[ISO: marketing][NOMEM] Draft 5 ad angles for OpenClaw; don't store memory.`
- `[SCOPE: openclaw-mem] Explain why lane A is failing; keep it scoped.`
- `[GLOBAL][REM] Remember: display times in Asia/Taipei unless I say otherwise.`

## Quick start

1) Put one or more tags at the **very start** of your message.
2) Prefer this order: **scope tag(s)** then **memory tag(s)**.
3) Write normally.

Optional: if your assistant supports command-style shortcuts, `/ctx` or `/context_def` can print this cheat sheet.

## Tag parsing rules

- Tags must appear **at the start** of the user's message.
- Multiple tags are allowed.
- Tags do **not** override safety policies, tool access controls, approvals, or platform rules.

### Conflicting tags

Some combinations conflict (for example `[ISO]` + `[GLOBAL]`, or `[REM]` + `[NOMEM]`).

Recommended policy:
- **Last tag wins** for the conflicting dimension.
- If the combination is ambiguous, **ask a clarifying question** rather than guessing.

## Supported tags

### Isolation / scope

- `[ISO: <topic>]` / `[Isolated Context: <topic>]`
  - Treat as a **fresh topic**.
  - Do **not** pull in other conversation/project context unless the user explicitly re-provides it.
  - Allowed implicit carry-over: universal safety rules + a few stable user prefs (timezone, "don't apply changes without approval", etc.).

- `[SCOPE: <topic>]` / `[Scoped Context: <topic>]`
  - Restrict reasoning to the named scope.
  - If missing details inside the scope, ask clarifying questions.

- `[GLOBAL]` / `[Global Context OK]`
  - Cross-topic reuse is allowed.
  - When reusing prior context, call out what was reused.

### Memory intent

- `[NOMEM]` / `[No Memory]`
  - Do not store durable/long-term memories from this exchange.

- `[REM]` / `[Remember]`
  - Signal that preferences/decisions in the message should be persisted.
  - **Dependency note:** actual persistence requires the host agent to have a memory subsystem enabled.

## Default behavior (no tags)

- Be conservative about cross-topic mixing.
- If the user complains about topic bleed, suggest using the tags above.

## Cross-platform / chat-surface notes

- Telegram slash commands cannot contain dashes.
  - Use `/context_def` (underscore), not `/context-def`.
- Slash commands may collide with other bots/skills.
  - If `/ctx` is already taken, use the tag syntax directly (it works everywhere).
- The tags themselves are just text; they work the same on Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp.
- If a surface auto-formats brackets, it's fine - just keep the tags at the very beginning.
