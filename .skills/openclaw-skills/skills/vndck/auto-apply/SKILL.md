# Mokaru Job Search & Application Tracker

You can search for jobs, save and track job applications, and read the user's career profile through the Mokaru API.

**Important:** This skill does NOT submit job applications on behalf of the user. It helps with the preparation: finding jobs, saving them to a tracker, updating application status, and reviewing the user's profile. The user (or their browser agent) must visit the `applyLink` from search results to actually apply. When the user says "apply", save the job to their tracker and provide the apply link so they can complete the application themselves.

## Authentication

Every request requires a Bearer token. The token is stored in the `MOKARU_API_KEY` environment variable and starts with `mk_`.

Include this header on all requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer $MOKARU_API_KEY
```

## Base URL

```
https://api.mokaru.ai
```

All endpoints are under `/v1/`.

**Method:** `POST /v1/jobs/search`

**Required scope:** `jobs:search`

**Rate limit:** 30 requests per minute

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field            | Type    | Required | Description                                                  |
|------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `query`          | string  | Yes      | Job search keywords (e.g. "software engineer")               |
| `location`       | string  | No       | City, state, or country (e.g. "San Francisco, CA")           |
| `remote`         | boolean | No       | Filter for remote jobs only                                  |
| `employmentType` | string  | No       | E.g. "fulltime", "parttime", "contract"                      |
| `datePosted`     | string  | No       | Recency filter (e.g. "today", "3days", "week", "month")      |
| `page`           | number  | No       | Page number, starts at 1. Each page returns up to 25 results |

**Curl example:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.mokaru.ai/v1/jobs/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOKARU_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "frontend engineer",
    "location": "New York",
    "remote": true,
    "page": 1
  }' | jq .
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "clx...",
      "title": "Frontend Engineer",
      "company": "Acme Corp",
      "companyLogo": "https://...",
      "companyWebsite": "https://...",
      "location": "New York, NY",
      "city": "New York",
      "state": "NY",
      "country": "US",
      "isRemote": true,
      "employmentType": "fulltime",
      "applyLink": "https://...",
      "applyIsDirect": false,
      "publisher": "LinkedIn",
      "description": "<p>We are looking for a Frontend Engineer...</p>",
      "highlights": { "qualifications": [...], "responsibilities": [...] },
      "benefits": ["Health insurance", "401k"],
      "salaryMin": 120000,
      "salaryMax": 160000,
      "salaryPeriod": "year",
      "postedAt": "2026-03-10T..."
    }
  ],
  "total": 142,
  "hasMore": true,
  "page": 1,
  "source": "database+providers"
}
```

The `source` field indicates whether results came from the internal database only (`"database"`) or also from external providers (`"database+providers"`). External providers require a Plus subscription.

**How to use the results:** Present jobs in a readable list. Include the title, company, location, salary range (if available), and the apply link. If `hasMore` is true, you can fetch the next page.

### 2. Create Application

**When to use:** The user wants to save or track a job. They might say "save this job" or "add this to my tracker." You can also use this right after a search to save a result.

**Method:** `POST /v1/tracker/applications`

**Required scope:** `tracker:write`

**Rate limit:** 20 requests per minute

**Request body (JSON):**

| Field            | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jobTitle`       | string | Yes      | Job title (max 200 chars)                                                                        |
| `company`        | string | Yes      | Company name (max 200 chars)                                                                     |
| `location`       | string | No       | Job location (max 200 chars)                                                                     |
| `jobUrl`         | string | No       | URL of the job posting (must be a valid URL). Used for duplicate detection                       |
| `jobDescription` | string | No       | Full job description text (max 50,000 chars). Required for `autoPrepare` (min 500 chars).        |
| `jobListingId`   | string | No       | If saving from a Mokaru search result, pass the job's `id` to automatically pull salary/details  |
| `source`         | string | No       | One of: `LinkedIn`, `CompanyWebsite`, `JobWebsite`, `Referral`, `Agency`, `Other`. Defaults to `Other` |
| `autoPrepare`    | boolean | No      | When `true`, Mokaru duplicates the user's default resume and tailors it to the job description using AI. Requires Plus plan, a default resume, and a job description of at least 500 characters. |

**Curl example:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.mokaru.ai/v1/tracker/applications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOKARU_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jobTitle": "Frontend Engineer",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "location": "New York, NY",
    "jobUrl": "https://acme.com/careers/frontend",
    "jobListingId": "clx...",
    "source": "JobWebsite",
    "autoPrepare": true
  }' | jq .
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "applicationId": "clx...",
  "existing": false,
  "autoPrepare": true
}
```

If `existing` is `true`, the application was already tracked (matched by `jobUrl`) and the existing ID is returned. No duplicate is created.

If `autoPrepare` is `true` in the response, Mokaru is tailoring the user's resume in the background (~30 seconds). The application status will be `preparing` until done.

**Auto-prep errors:** If auto-prep fails, the API returns a clear error code:
- `PLAN_REQUIRED` (403) - user needs a Plus plan
- `NO_DEFAULT_RESUME` (400) - user must set a default resume in Mokaru first
- `JOB_DESCRIPTION_TOO_SHORT` (400) - job description must be at least 500 characters

**Workflow tip:** When saving a job from search results, pass the `id` from the search result as `jobListingId`. This auto-fills salary and description data. Add `"autoPrepare": true` to also tailor the resume automatically.

## Workflows

### Finding, saving, and preparing for jobs

1. Optionally call `GET /v1/profile` to understand the user's background.
2. Call `POST /v1/jobs/search` with a query based on what the user asked for (or derived from their profile).
3. Present the results with the `applyLink` for each job.
4. If the user wants to save one, call `POST /v1/tracker/applications` with the job details and pass the job `id` as `jobListingId`. Add `"autoPrepare": true` to tailor their resume automatically.
5. To actually apply, the user must visit the `applyLink` themselves. Provide it clearly.

### Reviewing application pipeline

1. Call `GET /v1/tracker/applications` to get all applications, or filter by status.
2. Summarize the pipeline: how many in each status, which are highest priority.
3. If the user wants to update one, call `PATCH /v1/tracker/applications/{id}`.

### Managing contacts

1. Call `GET /v1/contacts` to list all contacts, or use `search` to find by name/company.
2. Call `GET /v1/contacts/{id}` for full contact details.
3. To add a new contact, call `POST /v1/contacts` with at least `firstName` and `lastName`.
4. To update contact info, call `PATCH /v1/contacts/{id}` with the fields to change. Pass `null` to clear optional fields.
5. To delete, call `DELETE /v1/contacts/{id}`.

### Managing work experiences

1. Call `GET /v1/experiences` to list all work experiences.
2. Call `GET /v1/experiences/{id}` to see full details of a specific experience.
3. To add a new experience, call `POST /v1/experiences` with at least `jobTitle` and `company`.
4. To update, call `PATCH /v1/experiences/{id}` with the fields to change. Pass `null` to clear optional fields.
5. To delete, call `DELETE /v1/experiences/{id}`.

### Managing education

1. Call `GET /v1/education` to list all education entries.
2. Call `GET /v1/education/{id}` to see full details of a specific education entry.
3. To add, call `POST /v1/education` with at least `school`.
4. To update, call `PATCH /v1/education/{id}` with the fields to change. Pass `null` to clear optional fields.
5. To delete, call `DELETE /v1/education/{id}`.

### Managing skills

1. Call `GET /v1/skills` to list all skills.
2. Call `GET /v1/skills/{id}` to see details of a specific skill.
3. To add a skill, call `POST /v1/skills` with at least `name`.
4. To update, call `PATCH /v1/skills/{id}` with the fields to change. Pass `null` to clear optional fields.
5. To delete, call `DELETE /v1/skills/{id}`.

### Managing resumes

1. Call `GET /v1/resume` to see all resumes and find the right one.
2. Call `GET /v1/resume/{id}` to read the full content of a resume.
3. To create a new resume, call `POST /v1/resume` with a name and optional content.
4. To update resume content (add skills, experiences, etc.), call `PATCH /v1/resume/{id}` with the fields to change.
5. To export as PDF, call `POST /v1/resume/{id}/export/pdf` and save the binary response to a file.
6. To delete, call `DELETE /v1/resume/{id}`. Linked applications are unlinked, not deleted.

## Error Handling

| Status | Meaning                  | What to do                                                        |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400    | Bad request / validation | Check the `details` field for which fields failed. Fix and retry. |
| 401    | Invalid or missing token | Tell the user their API key is invalid or expired.                |
| 403    | Insufficient permissions | The API key does not have the required scope for this endpoint.   |
| 404    | Not found                | The application or profile does not exist.                        |
| 409    | Processing               | Resume is being tailored by auto-prep. Wait and retry.            |
| 429    | Rate limited             | Wait before retrying. Do not hammer the endpoint.                 |
| 500    | Server error             | Retry once. If it persists, tell the user something went wrong.   |

Always check the HTTP status before parsing the response body. On errors, the body contains an `error` field with a human-readable message.
