---

## Structure Template

```markdown
<img
  src="{logo_url}"

  style="display:block; margin:0 auto; max-width:200px; background: transparent;"
/>

# {Company Name}

📍 {Location} · 📧 {email} · 🌐 [{website}]({url})

---

## About

{2-3 paragraphs covering: what the company does, who it serves, what makes it different. Lead with customer value, not company history. Founding story only if it adds credibility or emotional connection.}

---

## Services

| Service | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| {Service 1} | {What it is — 1 sentence} | {What the customer gets} |
| {Service 2} | {What it is} | {Customer benefit} |
| {Service 3} | {What it is} | {Customer benefit} |

---

## Why {Company Name}

- ✅ {Value proposition 1 — specific, not generic}
- ✅ {Value proposition 2 — backed by evidence if possible}
- ✅ {Value proposition 3}
- ✅ {Value proposition 4}

---

## Our Work

{Brief case studies, notable clients, or portfolio highlights}

| Client / Project | What We Did | Result |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|

## Styling Guidelines

- **Logo**: Use `<img>` with `max-width:200px`, centered. Only include if user provides URL.
- **Tagline under H1**: Bold, one sentence. Should communicate what + for whom.
- **Services as a table**: Three columns — Service, Description, Benefit. Tables are scannable; paragraphs are not.
- **Value propositions**: Use ✅ emoji bullets for "Why Us" to make them feel like checkmarks/guarantees.
- **Contact CTA**: End with a clear call to action, not just listed contact info.
- **Omit sections freely**: Team, Our Work, and other sections are optional. Never include them with placeholder content.

## Chart Recommendations

Charts are **occasionally useful** in company profiles, typically for demonstrating traction or market position.

**Growth/traction bar chart** (for startups or growth-stage companies):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-bar
title: Clients Served by Year
Year,Clients
2022,24
2023,58
2024,112
2025,185
```
```

**Service distribution pie chart** (to show service mix):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-pie
title: Revenue by Service Line
Service,Share
Consulting,40
Development,35
"Managed Services",15
Training,10
```
```

Limit to 1-2 charts maximum. Company profiles should be text-forward.

## Professional Tips

1. **Lead with customer value, not company history** — "We help X do Y" beats "Founded in 2019 by..."
2. **Services table > services paragraphs** — Nobody reads 5 paragraphs about your services. A table with Description + Benefit columns is 10x more effective.
3. **Specific value props** — "99.9% uptime SLA" beats "Reliable service". "Avg response time: 2 hours" beats "Fast support".
4. **Social proof matters** — Client names, case study results, or testimonial quotes add instant credibility
5. **One clear CTA** — End with exactly one thing you want the visitor to do: email, call, book a demo
6. **Keep team bios short** — 1-2 sentences per person. Focus on relevant expertise, not life story
7. **Mobile-friendly structure** — Short paragraphs, tables, bullet points. No walls of text.
