## Styling Guidelines

- **Date and location immediately visible** — Use the key-value table at the top. These are the two things every visitor looks for first.
- **Banner image**: Full-width markdown image at the very top if available. Sets the mood.
- **Schedule as a table** — Time, Session, Speaker columns. Include breaks and networking slots.
- **Speaker bios: 1-2 sentences max** — Name, title, company, and what they'll talk about. No life stories.
- **Registration CTA is prominent** — Use bold link, H2 section header, and add urgency if applicable ("Only 30 spots")
- **Emoji section headers** — 📅 📋 🎤 📍 🎟 help with visual scanning on event pages

---

## Chart Recommendations

Charts are **rarely used** in event pages. One exception:

**Schedule timeline bar chart** (for multi-day or long events):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-bar
title: Conference Day 1 — Session Duration (min)
Session,Duration
"Opening Keynote",45
"Workshop A",90
"Lunch Break",60
"Panel Discussion",60
"Lightning Talks",30
"Networking Social",90
```
```

In general, tables are better than charts for event schedules.

## Professional Tips

1. **Date + location in the first 5 seconds** — If a visitor can't immediately find when and where, they'll leave
2. **Clear registration action** — One button or link. Don't make people search for how to sign up.
3. **Schedule with times** — "Afternoon session" is useless. "14:00–15:30" lets people plan their day.
4. **Speaker bios: 1-2 sentences** — Focus on why this person is qualified to speak on this topic. Not their full CV.
5. **Include practical details** — Parking, transit, Wi-Fi, what to bring, dress code. These reduce friction.
6. **Add urgency if real** — "Limited to 50 spots" or "Early bird ends March 20" drives action. But never fake scarcity.
7. **Virtual event details** — For online events, specify the platform (Zoom, Google Meet), whether it will be recorded, and time zone clearly.
