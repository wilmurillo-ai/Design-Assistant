# Dashboard / Metrics Template

## When to Use This Template

- User asks for a dashboard, KPI overview, metrics snapshot, or scorecard
- Keywords: dashboard, KPIs, metrics, scorecard, performance overview, stats, analytics summary
- Output is a data-dense overview with multiple metrics and visualizations
- Periodic snapshots (daily, weekly, monthly) of key business or system metrics

## Structure Template

## Styling Guidelines

- **At a Glance table is mandatory** — This is the dashboard's hero section. Bold the current values. Use ↑/↓ arrows with color indicators.
- **Change indicators**: `↑ 12%` for positive, `↓ 8%` for negative. Context determines whether up/down is good or bad (e.g., churn ↓ is good).
- **Status labels**: Use "On track" / "At risk" / "Off track" after each major metric chart.
- **Timestamp everything** — Dashboards without timestamps are untrustworthy.
- **Dense layout** — Dashboards should feel packed with information, not spacious. Minimize prose between charts.
- **Footer with schedule** — Tell the reader when the next update will be.

## Chart Recommendations

Dashboards are the **most chart-dense** content type. Use 3-6 charts.

**Trend line chart** (most common — show metric over time):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-line
title: Daily Active Users (Last 14 Days)
Date,DAU
"Mar 1",4200
"Mar 3",4350
"Mar 5",4100
"Mar 7",4500
"Mar 9",4680
"Mar 11",4450
"Mar 13",4720
"Mar 15",4890
```
```

**Multi-metric line chart** (compare related metrics):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-line
title: Signups vs Activations vs Paying
Week,Signups,Activated,Paying
W1,520,340,85
W2,580,365,92
W3,610,400,105
W4,650,425,118
```
```

**Breakdown bar chart** (category comparisons):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-bar
title: Support Tickets by Priority
Priority,Open,Resolved
Critical,8,42
High,24,89
Medium,56,134
Low,32,98
```
```

**Composition pie chart** (distribution of a whole):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-pie
title: Traffic by Channel
Channel,Sessions
Organic,4200
Direct,2800
Paid,1900
Social,850
Referral,620
```
```

**Scatter chart** (correlation between two metrics):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-scatter
title: Feature Usage vs Retention
"Usage Score","Retention %"
12,45
28,62
35,58
48,71
55,74
62,78
75,85
88,91
```
```

## Professional Tips

1. **Most important metric first** — Lead with the KPI the audience cares about most
2. **Always include comparison periods** — A number without context is meaningless. Show vs. last period, vs. target, or vs. benchmark.
3. **Use ↑↓ arrows consistently** — Up arrow for increases, down arrow for decreases. Let context determine if it's good (revenue ↑) or bad (churn ↑).
4. **Keep it scannable** — If someone can't get the story in 10 seconds from the At a Glance table, the dashboard has failed
5. **Chart + table pairing** — Charts show trends and patterns; tables provide exact numbers. Use both for important metrics.
6. **Flag anomalies explicitly** — Don't let the reader wonder why there's a spike. Call it out in the Notes section.
7. **Consistent time periods** — Don't mix daily and weekly data in the same chart. Keep time scales uniform.
8. **Limit to 6 charts max** — More than 6 charts in a single page becomes overwhelming. Prioritize ruthlessly.

## Anomalies & Notes

- ⚠️ DAU spike on Mar 13 (+8% single-day) traced to HackerNews front page mention
- ℹ️ Churn decrease partly seasonal — March historically has lower churn
- 📌 Action: investigate Add-ons revenue jump (+12%) — may indicate pricing page A/B test working
