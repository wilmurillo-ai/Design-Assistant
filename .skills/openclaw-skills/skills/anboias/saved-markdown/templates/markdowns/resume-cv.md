## Styling Guidelines

- **Profile photo**: Always use the circular `<img>` tag with `border-radius:50%` when user provides a photo URL. Center it above the name.
- **Contact row**: Keep all contact info on 1-2 lines using `·` as separators. Use emoji prefixes (📧, 📱, 📍, 🔗).
- **Section headers**: Use emoji-prefixed H2s (💼, 🛠, 🎓, 🏆, 📬) for visual scanning.
- **Skills table**: Always use a table, never a comma-separated list — tables scan faster.
- **Horizontal rules** (`---`): Use between major sections for visual breathing room.
- **Bold company names and dates**: Makes the career timeline scannable.

---

## Chart Recommendations

Charts are **rarely used** in resumes. Exceptions:

- **Skills proficiency bar chart** (only if user specifically requests a visual skills rating):
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-bar
title: Technical Skills Proficiency
Skill,Proficiency
Python,95
TypeScript,88
React,82
Docker,78
AWS,85
```
```

- **Career timeline** (only for visual portfolios, not standard resumes)

In general, prefer tables over charts for resumes — they're more professional and information-dense.

## Professional Tips

1. **Lead with achievements, not responsibilities** — "Increased revenue by 40%" beats "Responsible for revenue growth"
2. **Quantify everything** — Numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes, timelines make claims credible
3. **Action verbs first** — Start every bullet with: Led, Built, Designed, Reduced, Increased, Launched, Automated, Delivered
4. **One-page equivalent** — Keep total content to what would fit on 1-2 printed pages. Ruthlessly cut filler.
5. **Omit empty sections** — No education? Skip it. No certifications? Skip it. Never include placeholder text.
6. **Tailor the tagline** — The line under the name should communicate role + unique value, not just a job title
7. **Most recent first** — Always reverse chronological order for experience and education
8. **Contact CTA at the end** — Close with a warm, actionable invitation to connect
