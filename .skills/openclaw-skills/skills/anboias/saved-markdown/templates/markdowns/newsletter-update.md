---

## Structure Template

```markdown
# {Newsletter Title}

**{Edition label}** · {Date or date range}

{One-sentence hook or theme for this edition.}

---

## 🔑 Highlights

- **{Headline 1}** — {One sentence summary}
- **{Headline 2}** — {One sentence summary}
- **{Headline 3}** — {One sentence summary}

---

## {Main Story 1 Title}

{2-3 paragraphs covering the most important item. Include context, what happened, and why it matters.}

---

## {Main Story 2 Title}

{2-3 paragraphs for the second most important item.}

---

## Quick Updates

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| {Update 1} | {✅ Done / 🔄 In Progress / 📋 Planned} | {One-line detail} |
| {Update 2} | {Status} | {Detail} |
| {Update 3} | {Status} | {Detail} |

---

- **{Date}** — {Event or milestone}
- **{Date}** — {Event or milestone}
- **{Date}** — {Event or milestone}

---

## 💬 Quote / Spotlight

> — {Attribution}

---

*{Sign-off or CTA. E.g., "Questions? Reply to this page." or "See you next week!"}*
```

---

## Styling Guidelines

- **Highlights section is the TL;DR** — Write it so skimmers get the full picture without reading anything else
- **Bold the item name in highlights** — "**New API launched** — REST endpoints for billing now live" is scannable
- **Status emoji in quick updates** — ✅ Done, 🔄 In Progress, 📋 Planned, ⚠️ Blocked
- **Upcoming section with bold dates** — Dates should be the most visible element in each line
- **Consistent structure across issues** — Readers learn the layout and find information faster
- **Edition labels** — "Issue #12", "Week of March 10", "Q1 2026" — helps readers orient in a series

---

## Chart Recommendations

Charts are **occasionally useful** in newsletters, especially for metric-focused updates.

**Progress/milestone bar chart:**
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-bar
title: Q1 Goals Progress (%)
Goal,Progress
"Launch v2.0",100
"Hire 3 engineers",67
"1000 paying users",82
"SOC 2 certification",45
```
```

**Trend line for key metric:**
```
```markdown-ui-widget
chart-line
title: Weekly Active Users
Week,WAU
W1,2400
W2,2650
W3,2800
W4,3100
W5,3350
```
```

Limit to 1-2 charts. Newsletters should be text-forward and quick to scan.

---

## Professional Tips

1. **Highlights must stand alone** — If someone reads only the top 3 bullets, they should know everything important
2. **Consistent structure across issues** — Same sections in the same order every time. Readers learn the format.
3. **One voice, one tone** — Newsletters feel personal. Pick a voice (casual, professional, enthusiastic) and stick with it.
4. **Quick Updates table for low-priority items** — Not everything deserves a paragraph. Status tables are perfect for "need to mention but not elaborate" items.
5. **Include a forward-looking section** — "Upcoming" creates anticipation and gives readers a reason to come back
6. **Keep editions focused** — 2-3 main stories max. If you have 10 things to say, most belong in Quick Updates.
7. **Sign-off creates connection** — A brief personal note or CTA at the end makes it feel less like a broadcast
