# CN→EN Amazon Listing Writer ✍️

**Turn Chinese product info into Amazon-ready English listings.**

Stop paying translators for word-for-word copy that doesn't convert. Paste your Chinese product details — supplier specs, 1688 listings, your own notes — and get 3 complete Amazon listing variations written for Western buyers.

No translation services needed. No API keys required.

---

## Usage

```
Write an Amazon listing for this product:

[Paste Chinese product info, specs, or description here]

Category: [e.g. kitchen tools / pet supplies / electronics]
Target market: [e.g. US / UK / both]
Key selling points: [optional — anything you want emphasized]
Price point: [optional — e.g. budget / mid-range / premium]
```

English input works too — just describe the product and the agent will write the listing.

---

## What You Get

For each of the 3 variations:

- **Title** — keyword-optimized, benefit-forward, within Amazon character limits
- **5 Bullet Points** — benefit-first framing, secondary keywords distributed, mobile-safe length
- **Product Description** — 2000-char narrative version for non-A+ sellers
- **Backend Keyword Suggestions** — 250-byte search terms field, no repetition

Variations are differentiated by angle:
1. **Conversion-focused** — benefit-heavy, emotional hooks, trust signals
2. **SEO-focused** — keyword density maximized while staying readable
3. **Brand-focused** — cleaner voice, premium positioning, lifestyle framing

---

## Cultural Adaptation Built In

This isn't a translation tool. It rewrites for Western buyers:

- Reframes Chinese-market selling points into Western buyer priorities
- Adds trust signals Western buyers expect (warranty language, safety certs, customer support)
- Adjusts size/measurement references for target market conventions
- Removes hyperbolic claims that reduce trust with EN audiences
- Writes in natural, native-sounding English — not translated English

---

## How It Works

**Step 1:** Parse the input — product type, key features, specs, and any selling points provided.

**Step 2:** If input is Chinese, extract and interpret key product attributes. Do not translate literally — interpret intent and benefits.

**Step 3:** Research the category context — typical buyer personas, common objections, competitor listing patterns (based on trained knowledge).

**Step 4:** Generate 3 listing variations using the output framework below.

**Step 5:** For each variation, validate: keyword placement, character limits, Amazon policy compliance, benefit-vs-feature balance.

**Step 6:** Deliver all 3 with brief notes on when to use each variation.

---

## Output Format

```
## Variation 1 — Conversion-Focused

**Title:** [title here]

**Bullets:**
• [bullet 1]
• [bullet 2]
• [bullet 3]
• [bullet 4]
• [bullet 5]

**Description:**
[description here]

**Backend Keywords:**
[keyword suggestions here]

---
*Best for: [when to use this variation]*
```

Repeated for all 3 variations.

---

## Amazon Compliance Checks

Every listing is checked against:
- Title: no promotional phrases, no ALL CAPS beyond brand/acronym
- Bullets: no shipping claims, no seller-specific info, no price references
- Description: no external links, no contact info
- Character limits: title ≤200, bullets ≤500 each, description ≤2000
