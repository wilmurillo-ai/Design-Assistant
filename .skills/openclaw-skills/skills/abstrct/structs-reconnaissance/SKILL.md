name: structs-reconnaissance
description: Gathers intelligence on players, guilds, planets, and the galaxy in Structs. Use when scouting enemy players, checking planet defenses, monitoring fleet movements, assessing guild strength, surveying the galaxy map, gathering intel before combat or raids, or updating competitive intelligence. Persists findings to memory/intel/.

# Structs Reconnaissance

## Procedure

1. **Query entities** — All via `structsd query structs [subcommand] [args]`:
   - Self: `address [your-address]` — resolves your address to a player ID. A result of `1-0` means no player exists for that address.
   - Players: `player [id]`, `player-all`
   - Planets: `planet [id]`, `planet-all`, `planet-all-by-player [player-id]`, `planet-attribute [planet-id] [type]`, `planet-attribute-all`
   - Structs: `struct [id]`, `struct-all`, `struct-attribute [id] [type]`, `struct-type [id]`, `struct-type-all`
   - Fleets: `fleet [id]`, `fleet-all`, `fleet-by-index [index]`
   - Guilds: `guild [id]`, `guild-all`, `guild-membership-application [id]`, `guild-membership-application-all`
   - Energy: `reactor [id]`, `reactor-all`, `infusion [id]`, `infusion-all`, `infusion-all-by-destination [dest-id]`, `provider [id]`, `provider-all`, `agreement [id]`, `agreement-all`, `agreement-all-by-provider [provider-id]`
   - Power: `allocation [id]`, `allocation-all`, `allocation-all-by-source [source-id]`, `allocation-all-by-destination [dest-id]`, `substation [id]`, `substation-all`
   - Grid: `grid [id]`, `grid-all`
   - Block: `block-height`
2. **Assess targets** — For players: structs, power capacity, fleet status (onStation = can build; away = raiding). For planets: ore remaining, defense structs, shield. For guilds: members, Central Bank status.
3. **Identify vulnerabilities** — Unrefined ore stockpile, power near capacity, undefended planet, fleet away (raiding).
4. **Persist intelligence** — After gathering, update:
   - [memory/intel/players/{player-id}.md](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) — Player dossier (profile, behavior, vulnerabilities, relationship)
   - [memory/intel/guilds/{guild-id}.md](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) — Guild profile (members, bank status, strengths, weaknesses)
   - [memory/intel/territory.md](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) — Planet ownership, ore, defense levels
   - [memory/intel/threats.md](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) — Threat board ranked by severity

## Commands Reference

| Entity | Query Command |
|--------|---------------|
| Address → Player | `structsd query structs address [address]` (returns player ID; `1-0` = nonexistent) |
| Player | `structsd query structs player [id]`, `player-all` |
| Planet | `structsd query structs planet [id]`, `planet-all`, `planet-all-by-player [player-id]` |
| Planet attribute | `structsd query structs planet-attribute [planet-id] [type]`, `planet-attribute-all` |
| Struct | `structsd query structs struct [id]`, `struct-all`, `struct-attribute [id] [type]` |
| Struct type | `structsd query structs struct-type [id]`, `struct-type-all` |
| Fleet | `structsd query structs fleet [id]`, `fleet-all`, `fleet-by-index [index]` |
| Guild | `structsd query structs guild [id]`, `guild-all` |
| Membership app | `structsd query structs guild-membership-application [id]`, `guild-membership-application-all` |
| Reactor | `structsd query structs reactor [id]`, `reactor-all` |
| Infusion | `structsd query structs infusion [id]`, `infusion-all`, `infusion-all-by-destination [dest-id]` |
| Provider | `structsd query structs provider [id]`, `provider-all` |
| Agreement | `structsd query structs agreement [id]`, `agreement-all`, `agreement-all-by-provider [provider-id]` |
| Allocation | `structsd query structs allocation [id]`, `allocation-all`, `allocation-all-by-source`, `allocation-all-by-destination` |
| Substation | `structsd query structs substation [id]`, `substation-all` |
| Grid | `structsd query structs grid [id]`, `grid-all` |
| Block height | `structsd query structs block-height` |

## Verification

- Re-query entity after action to confirm state change.
- Cross-reference: player → planet → struct → fleet for full picture.
- Block height confirms chain sync.

## Error Handling

- **Entity not found**: ID may be invalid or entity destroyed. Try `-all` variants to discover current IDs.
- **Stale data**: Query `block-height`; re-run queries if chain has progressed.
- **Missing intel files**: Create `memory/intel/players/`, `memory/intel/guilds/` if absent. Follow formats in [memory/intel/README](https://structs.ai/memory/intel/README).

## Intelligence Persistence Loop

1. Run reconnaissance queries for target(s).
2. Parse results: owner, structs, power, shield, fleet status, guild.
3. Write/update [memory/intel/players/](https://structs.ai/memory/intel), [memory/intel/guilds/](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) per [README](https://structs.ai/memory/intel/README) formats.
4. Update [memory/intel/territory.md](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) with planet ownership table.
5. Update [memory/intel/threats.md](https://structs.ai/memory/intel) with ranked threats and response notes.
6. Include "Last Updated" date in each file.

## PostgreSQL Queries (Advanced)

If the Guild Stack is running locally, all reconnaissance queries can be done in **< 1 second** via PostgreSQL instead of CLI. This is essential for combat automation, real-time threat monitoring, and galaxy-wide scouting.

Example -- find all players with stealable ore, ranked by amount:

```sql
SELECT p.id, p.guild_id, COALESCE(g_ore.val, 0) as ore
FROM structs.player p
JOIN structs.grid g_ore ON g_ore.object_id = p.id AND g_ore.attribute_type = 'ore'
WHERE g_ore.val > 0
ORDER BY g_ore.val DESC;
```

Example -- enemy fleet composition at a planet:

```sql
SELECT s.id, st.class_abbreviation, s.operating_ambit, st.unit_defenses
FROM structs.struct s
JOIN structs.struct_type st ON st.id = s.type
JOIN structs.fleet f ON f.id = s.location_id
WHERE f.location_id = '2-105' AND s.is_destroyed = false AND s.location_type = 'fleet';
```

**Important**: The `structs.grid` table is key-value, not columnar. See [knowledge/infrastructure/database-schema](https://structs.ai/knowledge/infrastructure/database-schema) for the grid pattern and more query examples.
