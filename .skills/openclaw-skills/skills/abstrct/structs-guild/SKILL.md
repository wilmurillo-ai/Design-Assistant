# Structs Guild

**Important**: Entity IDs containing dashes (like `3-1`, `4-5`) are misinterpreted as flags by the CLI parser. All transaction commands in this skill use `--` before positional arguments to prevent this.

## Guild Rank System

Guilds use a numeric rank system to determine authority. Lower number = higher privilege.

| Rank | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Maximum privilege (guild creator) |
| 2–100 | Custom ranks assigned by leadership |
| 101 | Default rank assigned on join |
| 0 | Unset / no rank |

Rank-based authority: a player can only modify members whose rank is strictly worse (higher number) than their own. The guild creator (rank 1) can manage everyone.

## Procedure

1. **Discover guilds** — `structsd query structs guild-all` or `structsd query structs guild [id]`.
2. **Create guild** — Requires PermReactorGuildCreate (524288) on the reactor and PermSubstationConnection (1024) on the entry substation. `structsd tx structs guild-create TX_FLAGS -- [reactor-id] [endpoint] [entry-substation-id]`.
3. **Membership** — Join: `structsd tx structs guild-membership-join -- [guild-id] [infusion-id,infusion-id2,...]` (use `--player-id`, `--substation-id` if needed). New members receive default guild rank (101). Proxy join: `structsd tx structs guild-membership-join-proxy -- [guild-id] [player-id] [infusion-ids]`. Invite flow: `structsd tx structs guild-membership-invite -- [guild-id] [player-id]` → invitee runs `structsd tx structs guild-membership-invite-approve -- [guild-id]` or `structsd tx structs guild-membership-invite-deny -- [guild-id]`. Request flow: `structsd tx structs guild-membership-request -- [guild-id]` → owner runs `structsd tx structs guild-membership-request-approve -- [guild-id] [player-id]` or `structsd tx structs guild-membership-request-deny -- [guild-id] [player-id]`. Kick: `structsd tx structs guild-membership-kick -- [guild-id] [player-id]`.
4. **Rank management** — Update a member's rank: `structsd tx structs player-update-guild-rank TX_FLAGS -- [player-id] [guild-rank]`. Requires PermAdmin (2) on guild, or rank-based authority (actor rank strictly better than target's current rank). Update entry rank (rank assigned to new joiners): `structsd tx structs guild-update-entry-rank TX_FLAGS -- [new-entry-rank]`. Requires PermUpdate (4) on guild; new rank must be >= caller's own rank.
5. **Settings** — See Commands Reference: `guild-update-endpoint`, `guild-update-entry-substation-id`, `guild-update-join-infusion-minimum` (and `-minimum-by-invite`, `-minimum-by-request`), `guild-update-owner-id`. All use `--` before positional args.
6. **Central Bank** — Mint: `structsd tx structs guild-bank-mint TX_FLAGS -- [alpha-amount] [token-amount]` (no guild-id — signer's guild is used implicitly; both amounts are raw integers). Redeem: `structsd tx structs guild-bank-redeem -- [guild-id] [amount]`. Confiscate and burn: `structsd tx structs guild-bank-confiscate-and-burn -- [guild-id] [address] [amount]`.

## Provider Access Control via Guild Rank

To restrict a provider to members of a specific guild at a minimum rank, use guild rank permissions instead of direct player grants:

```
structsd tx structs permission-guild-rank-set --from [key] --gas auto -y -- [provider-id] [guild-id] 262144 [rank]
```

This grants PermProviderAgreementCreate (262144) on the provider to any member of the specified guild at or above the given rank. To revoke:

```
structsd tx structs permission-guild-rank-revoke --from [key] --gas auto -y -- [provider-id] [guild-id] 262144
```

| Update endpoint | `structsd tx structs guild-update-endpoint -- [guild-id] [endpoint]` |
| Update entry substation | `structsd tx structs guild-update-entry-substation-id -- [guild-id] [substation-id]` |
| Update infusion minimums | `structsd tx structs guild-update-join-infusion-minimum/minimum-by-invite/minimum-by-request -- [guild-id] [value]` |
| Update owner | `structsd tx structs guild-update-owner-id -- [guild-id] [new-owner-player-id]` |
| Bank mint | `structsd tx structs guild-bank-mint -- [alpha-amount] [token-amount]` (signer's guild, raw integers) |
| Bank redeem | `structsd tx structs guild-bank-redeem -- [guild-id] [amount]` |
| Bank confiscate | `structsd tx structs guild-bank-confiscate-and-burn -- [guild-id] [address] [amount]` |
| Set guild rank permission | `structsd tx structs permission-guild-rank-set -- [object-id] [guild-id] [permission] [rank]` |
| Revoke guild rank permission | `structsd tx structs permission-guild-rank-revoke -- [object-id] [guild-id] [permission]` |

**TX_FLAGS**: `--from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 -y`

## Verification

- **Guild**: `structsd query structs guild [id]` — members, settings, owner.
- **Membership applications**: `structsd query structs guild-membership-application-all` or by ID.
- **Bank collateral**: `structsd query structs guild-bank-collateral-address [guild-id]` — verify reserves.
- **Guild rank permissions**: `structsd query structs guild-rank-permission-by-object-and-guild [object-id] [guild-id]` — verify rank-based access.

## Error Handling

- **Insufficient infusion**: Guild may require minimum infusion to join. Query guild for `joinInfusionMinimum`; meet requirement or get invite (bypass).
- **Already member**: Cannot join twice. Check `guild-membership-application` status.
- **Mint/redeem failed**: Verify guild has sufficient Alpha Matter collateral for mint; sufficient tokens for redeem.
- **Permission denied**: Only guild owner (or delegated address) can update settings, approve requests, mint/redeem. Rank-based operations require actor rank strictly better than target.
- **Rank too low**: `guild-update-entry-rank` requires new rank >= caller's own rank. Cannot set entry rank higher than your own authority.
