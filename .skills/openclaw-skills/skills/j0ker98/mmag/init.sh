# Conversational Memory

Stores dialogue threads and session context.
Each file represents a session: `YYYY-MM-DD-<session-id>.md`

**Purpose:** Maintain coherence across ongoing dialogues.
Resolves references, tracks topic continuity, and enables multi-turn reasoning.
EOF

cat > "$ROOT/long-term/README.md" << 'EOF'
# Long-Term User Memory

Stores user biographical facts, preferences, and personality traits.
Each file is a topic-based profile: `user-profile.md`, `preferences.md`, etc.

**Purpose:** Personalize responses across sessions.
Injected as the highest-priority system message during context assembly.
Encrypted storage is strongly recommended for sensitive data.
EOF

cat > "$ROOT/episodic/README.md" << 'EOF'
# Episodic & Event-Linked Memory

Stores timestamped events, scheduled reminders, and habitual cues.
Each file is a date log: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Purpose:** Enable proactive, time-aware interactions.
Supports trigger-based retrieval (e.g., surface an event before it happens).
EOF

cat > "$ROOT/sensory/README.md" << 'EOF'
# Sensory & Context-Aware Memory

Stores environmental signals: location, weather, time-of-day, device state.
Each file is a context snapshot: `context-<timestamp>.md`

**Purpose:** Ground responses in the user's current environment.
Keeps context sensitive without being intrusive.
EOF

cat > "$ROOT/working/README.md" << 'EOF'
# Short-Term Working Memory

Ephemeral in-session scratchpad for current task goals and reasoning state.
Cleared at the end of each session via `prune.sh`.

**Purpose:** Transient workspace for goal tracking and multi-step reasoning.
Content should not persist beyond the active session.
