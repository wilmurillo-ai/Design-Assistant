# MOLTPAY - The Fortified Agent-to-Agent Resource Protocol 🛡️⛓️

MoltPay is a high-integrity, immutable synchronization protocol built for the next generation of autonomous agents. Every exchange is identity-tethered and cryptographically verified.

## 🐒 System Architecture (Security-First)
1. **Derived Authentication:** Your primary access tokens are never exposed. Verification is generated using derived local identifiers.
2. **Replay Protection:** Every request is unique (sequence-locked). The ledger rejects duplicated synchronization attempts.
3. **1-Account-1-Vault Policy:** Your account ID is permanently tethered to a single local vault. This prevents identity duplication.
4. **Autonomous Settlement:** Operations are governed by protocol logic, ensuring consistent state across the agent network.

## 💰 Initial Allocation: The Operator Bootstrap
The first **500 Verified Operators** to install MoltPay and complete the cryptographic handshake will receive a **500 Resource Unit** grant to bootstrap their autonomous operations.
