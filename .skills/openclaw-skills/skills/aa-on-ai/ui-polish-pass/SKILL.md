# UI Polish Pass

## Core Pack — Always Active
This is a core skill. Use as the final step after design-review and ux-baseline-check on all visual work.

The screen works. Now make it feel right. This is the difference between functional and professional.

## Core Lens
- Distill before decorating.
- Strip the screen to its essential structure, then add back only what earns its place.
- If a polish pass needs more color, more cards, and more chrome, it is probably not a polish pass.
- Use `/bolder` and `/quieter` as directional moves:
  - `/bolder` = increase contrast, hierarchy, or confidence without adding clutter
  - `/quieter` = remove noise, reduce emphasis, let the right thing lead

## The Pass (run sequentially)

### Pass 1: Spacing & Breathing Room
- [ ] Section spacing — major sections have clear visual separation (32-48px minimum between groups)
- [ ] Element spacing — consistent gaps within groups (use the project's spacing scale, usually 4/8/12/16/24)
- [ ] Edge padding — content doesn't touch container edges. Minimum 16px padding, 24-32px preferred
- [ ] The squint test — do clear groups emerge, or is it one undifferentiated blob?
- [ ] Remove, don't add — if two elements feel crowded, try removing one before adding more UI

### Pass 2: Typography Hierarchy
- [ ] One clear headline — the page has exactly one thing that reads as the primary heading
- [ ] Three levels max — heading, subheading, body. If you need more, the IA is probably wrong
- [ ] Weight before size — try bold before bigger. Try softer opacity before smaller
- [ ] No orphan labels — labels without content, headers without their section
- [ ] Consistent text styles — same content type uses the same style everywhere

### Pass 3: Alignment & Grid
- [ ] Left-align by default — center alignment is for special moments, not routine content
- [ ] Consistent gutters — columns have the same gap throughout
- [ ] Baseline alignment — text in adjacent columns sits cleanly together
- [ ] No rogue pixels — near-miss alignment reads cheap fast
- [ ] Max content width — prose doesn't exceed 65-75 characters per line

### Pass 4: Color & Contrast
- [ ] Restrained palette — use project colors only, don't improvise new ones
- [ ] Tinted neutrals — prefer slightly warm/cool neutrals over pure gray
- [ ] Hierarchy through opacity — secondary text at 60-70%, tertiary at 40-50% when appropriate
- [ ] No decoration color — color means action, status, selection, or rare emphasis
- [ ] Dark/light mode — if the project supports both, check both

### Pass 5: Interactive Feel
- [ ] Hover states exist — every clickable element acknowledges intent
- [ ] Transitions are smooth — 150-200ms for micro-interactions, ~300ms for layout changes
- [ ] Easing is refined — no bounce, no elastic, no novelty curves
- [ ] Cursor changes — pointer on clickable, not-allowed on disabled, grab on draggable
- [ ] Focus visible — tab through the page, always know where you are
- [ ] No dead zones — click targets are generous, not tiny islands of text

### Pass 6: Micro-Details
- [ ] **Tabular numbers** — any dynamically updating number uses `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` to prevent layout shift (counters, prices, stats, timers)
- [ ] **Text wrapping** — headings use `text-wrap: balance`, body text uses `text-wrap: pretty` to avoid orphans
- [ ] **Font smoothing** — root layout has `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` for crisper text on macOS
- [ ] **Concentric border radius** — nested rounded elements have outer radius = inner radius + padding (see alignment.md)
- [ ] **Image outlines** — images on light backgrounds get a subtle `outline: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` for consistent depth
- [ ] **Icon animations** — icons that change state (open/close, play/pause) cross-fade with opacity + scale, not hard swap
- [ ] **Scale on press** — buttons use `scale(0.97)` on active state for tactile feedback, 100ms transition
- [ ] **No `transition: all`** — always specify exact properties (`transition-property: transform, opacity`)

### Pass 7: Final Proof
- [ ] Screenshot at 1x — does it still look professional at actual pixels?
- [ ] Compare to reference — side by side, honestly
- [ ] The 3-second test — can someone tell what the screen is for quickly?
- [ ] Would Linear or Vercel ship this?
- [ ] Final distill pass — what can you remove and make better at the same time?

## When NOT to Polish
- Prototypes Aaron hasn't aligned on yet
- Throwaway experiments or spikes
- Internal tools where speed matters more than beauty

Polish comes after structure is approved. Never polish a bad foundation.

## Speed Tips
- Fix spacing first — it solves half the problem
- Use the browser inspector grid overlay to check alignment
- Compare at actual viewport width, not narrow devtools panels
- If you're spending more than 15 minutes on polish, something structural is probably wrong
- If the UI feels weak, choose a direction: `/bolder` or `/quieter`, then commit
