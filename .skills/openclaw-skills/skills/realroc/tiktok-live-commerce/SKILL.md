## Live Commerce Best Practices

### 1. Preparing for a Successful Live Session

**Pre-Event Checklist (Host):**
- ✅ Test equipment: camera, lighting, mic, internet speed
- ✅ Prepare product knowledge: features, benefits, pricing
- ✅ Set up TikTok Shop products and links
- ✅ Create discount codes and flash sale timers
- ✅ Outline session structure and pacing
- ✅ Prepare product demo area with good lighting
- ✅ Charge backup phone/equipment
- ✅ Post teaser content 1-3 days before

**Brand Preparation:**
- ✅ Provide product samples and detailed info to host
- ✅ Set up TikTok Shop inventory and pricing
- ✅ Create exclusive discount codes for live viewers
- ✅ Prepare flash sale inventory limits
- ✅ Ensure customer service team ready for post-live inquiries
- ✅ Set up order fulfillment process

### 2. During Live Session: Engagement Tactics

**Keeping Viewers Engaged:**
- **Opening (0-10 min)**: Welcome viewers, overview session plan, announce first flash sale
- **Product Showcase (10-90 min)**: Rotate through products every 8-12 minutes
- **Flash Sales**: Announce limited-time offers every 20-30 minutes
- **Interaction**: Answer chat questions constantly, shout out usernames
- **Urgency**: "Only 5 left at this price!", "Flash sale ends in 2 minutes!"
- **Social Proof**: "Wow, 50 people just bought this!", "Sold out in 30 seconds last week!"
- **Giveaways**: Random viewer prizes to keep audience watching
- **Closing (last 10 min)**: Final flash sale, recap best deals, tease next session

**Host Energy Management:**
- Maintain high energy but avoid sounding fake
- Take strategic brief pauses (product transitions, demo setups)
- Stay hydrated—keep water off-camera
- Stand if possible (more energetic than sitting)
- Smile genuinely and make "eye contact" with camera

### 3. Product Presentation Techniques

**Effective Demonstration:**
1. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Physically demonstrate product usage
2. **Before/After**: Visual transformations are compelling
3. **Storytelling**: "I was skeptical too, but after using this for a week..."
4. **Address Objections**: "I know some of you are thinking it's too expensive, but..."
5. **Comparison**: Show vs. competitor or older version
6. **Testimonials**: Read positive reviews from previous buyers

**Example Product Pitch:**
```
"Okay everyone, next up is our wireless charger. Now, I know
what you're thinking—'I already have a charger.' But THIS one
is different. Watch this... [demo placing phone on charger]
See? No cables, just drop and charge. I've been using this for
3 weeks and honestly, I can't go back. My nightstand used to be
a mess of cables!

Right now, for you guys watching live, it's 99 CNY instead of
149. That's 50 CNY off, but ONLY for the next 10 minutes. After
that, it goes back to regular price.

Let me show you one more cool feature... [continue demo]

Alright, I'm seeing a lot of you grabbing this—we only have 20
left at this price! If you've been thinking about it, now's the
time. Link is in my Shop tab."

### 4. Optimizing Conversions During Live

**High-Conversion Tactics:**
- **Limited Quantity**: "Only 15 units at this discount!"
- **Countdown Timers**: Display on-screen timer for flash sales
- **Price Anchoring**: "Usually 299, today only 199!"
- **Bundling**: "Buy 2, get 20% off total!"
- **Free Shipping**: "Free shipping for live viewers only!"
- **Bonus Gifts**: "First 20 buyers get a free travel case!"
- **Easy Checkout**: "Tap the orange bag, add to cart, done in 10 seconds!"

**Urgency Language:**
- "Flash sale starts NOW!"
- "This deal expires in 5 minutes!"
- "Almost sold out—only 8 left!"
- "We sold 200 of these in 15 minutes last week!"
- "This won't be at this price again!"

### 5. Post-Live Follow-Up

**Immediately After Session:**
- Thank viewers and recap top deals
- Announce next live session date/time
- Post highlight reel within 24 hours
- Create "Sold Out!" announcement for scarcity proof

**Performance Review:**
- GMV (total sales revenue)
- Conversion rate (buyers / viewers)
- Peak concurrent viewers
- Average watch time
- Top-selling products
- Viewer retention graph

**Iterate & Improve:**
- What products performed best?
- Which segments had highest retention?

## Troubleshooting

### Low Viewer Turnout

**Problem:** Live session had fewer viewers than expected.

**Solutions:**
1. **Insufficient Promotion**: Post more teaser content 3-5 days before
2. **Wrong Timing**: Test different time slots (evenings 7-9pm usually best)
3. **Unclear Value Prop**: Emphasize exclusive deals in promotion
4. **Audience Not Trained**: Build recurring schedule (same day/time weekly)

### High Viewers, Low Conversions

**Problem:** Many viewers but few purchases.

**Solutions:**
1. **Weak Offers**: Increase discount depth or add bonuses
2. **Too Much Talk, Not Enough Sales**: Balance education with CTAs
3. **Technical Issues**: Ensure TikTok Shop links working properly
4. **Pricing Concerns**: Address "too expensive" objections directly
5. **Trust Issues**: Show more testimonials and social proof

### Host Energy Too Low

**Problem:** Host seems tired or unenthusiastic.

**Solutions:**
1. **Session Too Long**: Limit first sessions to 90-120 minutes
2. **Co-Host Option**: Pair with second person for energy boost
3. **Structured Breaks**: Plan 2-minute transitions between products
4. **Pre-Session Prep**: Ensure host well-rested and energized
