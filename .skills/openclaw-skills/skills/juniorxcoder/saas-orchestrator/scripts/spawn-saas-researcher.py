    task = f"""🤖 SAAS Research Agent - Market Validation Mission

Target: Research and validate SAAS opportunity in {niche} for {target_market}
Revenue Goal: ${revenue_goal} MRR minimum

## Phase 1: Market Analysis
1. Market Size Research
   - Total addressable market (TAM) for {niche}
   - Serviceable addressable market (SAM) for {target_market}
   - Competitor analysis - who else is solving this problem?
   - Market maturity - emerging, growing, saturated?

2. Customer Research  
   - Who exactly has this problem? (be specific)
   - How painful is this problem? (nice-to-have vs must-have)
   - Current solutions they're using and why they suck
   - How much would they pay to solve this problem?
   - Where do these customers hang out online/offline?

## Phase 2: Competitor Intelligence
1. Direct Competitors
   - List top 5-10 competitors in {niche}
   - Analyze their pricing, features, positioning
   - Find their weaknesses and gaps
   - Read their customer reviews (G2, Capterra, etc.)
   - Identify opportunities to differentiate

2. Indirect Competitors
   - What are people doing now instead of using software?
   - Spreadsheets, manual processes, hiring people, etc.
   - Why might they prefer these over software?
   - How can we be 10x better than status quo?

## Phase 3: Revenue Validation
1. Pricing Research
   - What are competitors charging? (pricing tiers, annual discounts)
   - What price points work in {niche}? (sweet spots)
   - How much revenue per customer can we expect?
   - How many customers needed for ${revenue_goal} MRR?

2. Business Model Analysis
   - Subscription vs one-time vs usage-based pricing?
   - What pricing model makes sense for this problem?
   - How sticky is this problem? (churn considerations)
   - What's the customer lifetime value potential?

## Phase 4: Go-to-Market Strategy
1. Customer Acquisition
   - Where do target customers hang out?
   - What marketing channels would work best?
   - What's the estimated customer acquisition cost (CAC)?
   - How long is the sales cycle likely to be?

2. Launch Strategy
   - Best platforms to launch this SAAS (Product Hunt, etc.)
   - Communities where this would be welcomed
   - Potential partnerships or integrations
   - Early adopter identification strategy

## Deliverables Required
1. **Market Research Report** (2-3 pages)
   - Market size, competitor analysis, customer insights
   
2. **Revenue Validation Analysis**
   - Pricing strategy, customer math, business model
   
3. **Go-to-Market Plan**
   - Customer acquisition strategy, launch plan
   
4. **Go/No-Go Recommendation**
   - Should we build this? Why or why not?
   - If yes, what's the biggest risk to address first?
   - If no, what would need to change to make it viable?

## Success Criteria
✅ Market large enough for ${revenue_goal}+ MRR potential
✅ Clear customer pain point that's must-solve, not nice-to-have  
✅ Competitor gaps we can exploit
✅ Realistic path to ${revenue_goal} MRR within 6-12 months
✅ Customers willing to pay premium pricing ($29+/month)

Time to complete: Research thoroughly, but don't overthink. We need actionable insights, not academic analysis.
