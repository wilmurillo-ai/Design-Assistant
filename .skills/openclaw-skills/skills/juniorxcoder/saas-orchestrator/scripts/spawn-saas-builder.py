Product: {product_idea}
Tech Stack: {tech_stack}
Timeline: {timeline}
Based on: {validated_research}

## Phase 1: Technical Architecture & Setup
1. Project Structure
   - Set up {tech_stack} project with best practices
   - Configure development environment
   - Set up version control (Git) with proper branching strategy
   - Set up staging and production environments

2. Core Infrastructure
   - Database design and setup
   - Authentication system (users, roles, permissions)
   - Payment integration (Stripe setup)
   - Basic API structure if needed
   - Error handling and logging

3. Development Workflow
   - Set up automated testing (unit tests minimum)
   - Set up deployment pipeline
   - Set up monitoring and analytics
   - Set up backup and security measures

## Phase 2: Core Feature Development
1. MVP Feature Set (Based on {validated_research})
   - Build the ONE core feature that solves the main problem
   - Make it functional, not beautiful
   - Ensure it works end-to-end
   - Add basic user interface

2. User Experience
   - Simple onboarding flow
   - Basic dashboard/landing page
   - User settings and profile management
   - Basic help/documentation

3. Payment & Billing
   - Integrate Stripe for payments
   - Set up subscription management
   - Create pricing page
   - Set up billing notifications

## Phase 3: Polish & Launch Preparation
1. Quality Assurance
   - Test all core functionality
   - Fix critical bugs only (ignore nice-to-haves)
   - Test payment flow thoroughly
   - Test on different devices/browsers

2. Launch Assets
   - Create landing page with clear value proposition
   - Set up basic analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
   - Create simple documentation/help center
   - Set up customer support (email, chat, etc.)

3. Marketing Preparation
   - Write launch copy for Product Hunt, etc.
   - Create social media accounts
   - Prepare launch email to waitlist
   - Set up basic SEO optimization

## Phase 4: Launch & Iterate
1. Soft Launch
   - Launch to waitlist first
   - Get feedback from early users
   - Fix critical issues immediately
   - Monitor analytics and usage

2. Public Launch
   - Launch on Product Hunt, Hacker News, relevant communities
   - Reach out to press and bloggers
   - Share in relevant online communities
   - Monitor and respond to feedback

3. Post-Launch Optimization
   - Fix any issues that arise
   - Optimize conversion funnel
   - Improve onboarding based on user behavior
   - Plan next features based on feedback

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast load times, responsive design
- **Security**: Basic security measures (HTTPS, input validation)
- **Scalability**: Handle initial growth (don't over-engineer)
- **Maintainability**: Clean code that's easy to modify
- **Documentation**: Basic setup and deployment docs

## Success Criteria
✅ Core feature works end-to-end
✅ Payment processing functional
✅ User can sign up and use product
✅ Landing page converts visitors to trials
✅ Basic analytics tracking usage
✅ Ready for public launch within {timeline}
✅ Can handle 100+ concurrent users

## What NOT to Build (MVP Rules)
❌ No mobile app (mobile web is enough)
❌ No advanced analytics (basic tracking only)
❌ No admin dashboard (use database directly)
❌ No API for third parties (build later if needed)
❌ No advanced user roles (user/admin only)
❌ No real-time features (batch processing fine)
❌ No file uploads (use existing services)
❌ No complex integrations (manual processes OK)

## Deliverables Required
1. **Working MVP** deployed and functional
2. **Landing page** with payment integration
3. **Documentation** for setup and basic usage
4. **Launch plan** with specific platforms and timeline
5. **Analytics setup** tracking key metrics
6. **Post-launch action plan** based on initial feedback

Timeline: Complete MVP within {timeline}. Speed over perfection.
Focus on revenue generation from day one.

🦞 JUNAI expects a working product that can start generating revenue immediately."""
