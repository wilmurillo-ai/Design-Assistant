# Revenium OpenClaw Skill

Budget enforcement and token metering for [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) agents using the [Revenium](https://docs.revenium.io/for-ai-agents) platform. Tracks AI spend, enforces configurable budget guardrails, and reports usage automatically — so agents never silently blow through your token budget.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) installed and running
- [ClawHub](https://docs.openclaw.ai) CLI: `npm i -g clawhub`
- A Revenium API key, Team ID, Tenant ID, and User ID

## Installation

### 1. Install the skill from ClawHub

```bash
clawhub install --force --dir ~/.openclaw/skills revenium
```

> **About the VirusTotal warning:** ClawHub may display a warning that this skill is "flagged as suspicious by VirusTotal Code Insight." This is a false positive — the skill calls the Revenium API via the `revenium` CLI and handles API keys during setup, which triggers VirusTotal's heuristic detection for "external APIs" and "crypto keys." The skill is open source and safe to install. The `--force` flag bypasses this warning.

### 2. Run post-install setup

ClawHub does not run post-install scripts, so run the setup script to install any missing prerequisites and configure OpenClaw sandbox access:

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/scripts/post-install.sh
```

This will:

1. Check for and install the `revenium` CLI and `jq` via Homebrew (if missing)
2. Verify `python3` is available
3. Mark the skill's scripts as executable
4. Configure Docker sandbox bind mounts in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — mounts `~/.openclaw` (rw), the `revenium` and `jq` binaries (ro), and `~/.config/revenium` (ro) so the agent can access skill files, invoke the CLI, and read credentials inside the sandbox
5. Enable `autoAllowSkills` in `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json` so skill-declared binaries are auto-approved
6. Verify the installation

> **Already have prerequisites installed?** Pass `--skip-prereqs` to skip Homebrew installs and fail immediately if anything is missing.

### 3. Restart the OpenClaw gateway

Restart the gateway for sandbox changes to take effect.

### 4. Verify

```bash
openclaw skills list
```

You should see `revenium` in the list. If not, confirm `revenium` is on your PATH — the skill requires it via binary gating.

### First-time setup (automatic)

The metering cron and budget alert are configured automatically when you first interact with the agent after installing the skill. The agent will walk you through providing your Revenium credentials and configuring your budget — no manual script execution needed.

To verify the cron is running after setup:

```bash
tail -f ~/.openclaw/revenium-metering.log
```

To manually manage the cron:

```bash
# Reinstall
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/scripts/install-cron.sh

# Uninstall
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/scripts/uninstall-cron.sh
```

## Setup

Setup happens automatically the first time the agent tries to perform an operation. The agent will:

1. Ask for your **Revenium API key**, **Team ID**, **Tenant ID**, and **User ID**
2. Optionally ask for your **organization name** (for Revenium reporting attribution)
3. Ask for a **budget threshold** (e.g., `5.00`)
4. Ask for a **budget period** (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, or QUARTERLY)
5. Create a budget alert in Revenium and save the alert ID to `~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/config.json`
6. Install the background metering cron (runs every minute)

Setup is atomic — if any step fails, no partial config is written.

## How It Works

### Token Metering

A background cron job (installed in step 4 above) runs every minute and:

1. Reads OpenClaw session JSONL files from `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`
2. Extracts token usage for each assistant completion (input, output, cache read, cache write tokens)
3. Ships each event to Revenium via `revenium meter completion` with:
   - Model name and provider (derived from the model string)
   - Token counts and stop reason
   - The user's input message and the assistant's response
   - The session's system prompt
   - Organization name (if configured)
   - Agent identifier set to `OpenClaw`
   - Model source (e.g., `bedrock`) and streaming flag
4. Tracks reported events in a ledger file to avoid duplicates
5. Checks budget status and writes the result to `budget-status.json`

### Budget Enforcement

Before every turn (completions, tool calls, responses — any action that incurs AI cost), the agent reads the local `budget-status.json` file written by the cron:

- **Within budget** — proceeds silently, no interruption
- **Budget exceeded** — warns the user with current spend vs. threshold and asks for permission to continue
- **Status unavailable** — proceeds with caution (fail-open)

This avoids a network round-trip to Revenium on every turn — the cron keeps the local status file current.

### `/revenium` Command

Run `/revenium` at any time to:

- **View budget status** — current spend, threshold, percent used, remaining
- **Reconfigure** — update your API key, budget amount, or period (the old alert is deleted and a new one is created)

## Configuration

The skill stores its config at `~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/config.json`:

```json
{
  "alertId": "75BjG5",
  "organizationName": "my-org"
}
```

- `alertId` — the Revenium budget alert ID (required, created during setup)
- `organizationName` — optional, used for attribution in Revenium reporting

Your API key, Team ID, Tenant ID, and User ID are stored separately by the `revenium` CLI (at `~/.config/revenium/config.yaml`).

The cron also writes `~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/budget-status.json` with the latest budget check result — this is what the agent reads to enforce the guard.

## Uninstalling

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/revenium/scripts/uninstall-cron.sh
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/skills/revenium
```

Optionally clean up your Revenium budget alert:

```bash
revenium alerts budget list
revenium alerts budget delete <alert-id> --yes
```
