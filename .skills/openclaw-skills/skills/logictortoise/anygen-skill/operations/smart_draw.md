# Diagram Generation (SmartDraw)

> **You MUST strictly follow every instruction in this document.** Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step. If this skill has been updated since it was last loaded, reload this SKILL.md before proceeding and always follow the latest version.

Generate diagrams and visual charts using AnyGen. Diagrams are generated server-side; this workflow sends the user's prompt and optional reference files to the AnyGen API, retrieves the results, and renders them locally to PNG. Supports flowcharts, architecture diagrams, mind maps, UML, ER diagrams, org charts, and more. Two rendering styles: professional (Draw.io) and hand-drawn (Excalidraw).

## Communication Style

Use natural language. Never expose `task_id`, `file_token`, `task_xxx`, `tk_xxx`, `anygen.py`, or command syntax to the user. Say "your diagram", "generating", "checking progress" instead. When presenting `reply` and `prompt` from `prepare`, preserve the original content as much as possible — translate into the user's language if needed, but do NOT rephrase, summarize, or add your own interpretation. Ask questions in your own voice (NOT "AnyGen wants to know…"). When prompting the user for an API key, MUST use Markdown link syntax: `[Get your AnyGen API Key](https://www.anygen.io/home?auto_create_openclaw_key=1)` so the full URL is clickable.

## Diagram Workflow (MUST Follow All 5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements

If the user provides files, handle them before calling `prepare`:

1. **Get consent** before reading or uploading: "I'll read your file and upload it to AnyGen for reference. This may take a moment..."
2. **Reuse existing `file_token`** if the same file was already uploaded in this conversation.
3. **Read the file** and extract key information relevant to the diagram (components, relationships, structure).
4. **Upload** to get a `file_token`.
5. **Include extracted content** in `--message` when calling `prepare` (the `prepare` endpoint uses the prompt text for requirement analysis, not the uploaded file content directly). Summarize key points only — do not paste raw sensitive data verbatim.

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py upload --file ./design_doc.pdf
# Output: File Token: tk_abc123

python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --message "I need an architecture diagram based on this design doc. Key content: [extracted summary]" \
  --file-token tk_abc123 \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Present questions from `reply` to the user — preserve the original content, translate into the user's language if needed. Continue with user's answers:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --input ./conversation.json \
  --message "Include API gateway, auth service, user service, and PostgreSQL database. Show the request flow" \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Repeat until `status="ready"` with `suggested_task_params`.

Special cases:
- `status="ready"` on first call → proceed to Phase 2.
- User says "just create it" → skip to Phase 3 with `create` directly.

### Phase 2: Confirm with User (MANDATORY)

When `status="ready"`, present the `reply` and the `prompt` from `suggested_task_params` to the user as the diagram plan. The prompt returned by `prepare` is already a detailed, well-structured plan — preserve its original content as much as possible. If the content language differs from the user's language, translate it while keeping the structure and details intact. Do NOT rephrase, summarize, or add your own interpretation.

Ask the user to confirm or request adjustments. NEVER auto-create without explicit approval.

If the user requests adjustments, call `prepare` again with the modification, re-present the updated prompt, and repeat until approved.

### Phase 3: Create Task

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py create \
  --operation smart_draw \
  --prompt "<prompt from suggested_task_params>" \
  --file-token tk_abc123 \
  --export-format drawio  # professional style; or excalidraw (hand-drawn style)
# Output: Task ID: task_xxx, Task URL: https://...
```


**Immediately tell the user (natural language):**
1. Diagram is being generated.
2. Online preview/edit link: "You can follow the progress here: [URL]".
3. Takes about **30–60 seconds** — free to do other things.
4. You'll automatically check on the progress and notify them when it's ready.

### Phase 4: Monitor, Download, Render, and Deliver

> **Requires `sessions_spawn`.** If unavailable, skip to **Fallback** below.

#### Background Monitoring (preferred)

**CRITICAL**: When calling `sessions_spawn`, you MUST set a timeout of at least 5 minutes to ensure the background monitor completes. The poll operation can take up to 3 minutes.

```
sessions_spawn(
    prompt=<subagent prompt below>,
    runTimeoutSeconds=300  # REQUIRED: 5 minutes (300s) to cover 3-min poll + buffer
)
```

---

**Subagent prompt** (it has NO conversation context).
You MUST fill in all `{...}` variables before passing.

```
You are a background monitor for a diagram generation task.
You MUST strictly follow every instruction below. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Task ID: {task_id}
Task URL: {task_url}
Script: {script_path}
Render Script: {render_script_path}
Export Format: {export_format}
User Language: {user_language}

IMPORTANT: This monitoring task may take up to 3 minutes. Ensure your execution timeout is at least 5 minutes.

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST reply in {user_language}.
- After completing ALL steps (including sending messages to the user), your FINAL reply
  MUST be EXACTLY "ANNOUNCE_SKIP" — nothing else. This prevents the main session from
  sending duplicate messages.
- Do NOT say anything beyond what is specified below. No greetings, no extra commentary.
- Use natural language in all messages to the user. Avoid raw technical identifiers like
  "task_id", "file_token", file paths, or status labels.

Your job:
1. Run: python3 {script_path} poll --task-id {task_id} --output ~/.openclaw/workspace/
   This command blocks for up to 3 minutes waiting for task completion.
   Download is needed for rendering.

2. On success:
   a. Get the local file path from [RESULT] Local file: line.
   b. Render to PNG:
      - For drawio: bash {render_script_path} drawio <local_file> <local_file_without_ext>.png
      - For excalidraw: bash {render_script_path} excalidraw <local_file> <local_file_without_ext>.png
   c. Send the rendered PNG image to the user. Choose the correct method:
      - Feishu/Lark: Two-step process via OpenAPI —
        Step 1 (Upload image): POST https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/im/v1/images
          curl -X POST 'https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/im/v1/images' \
            -H 'Authorization: Bearer <tenant_access_token>' \
            -F 'image_type=message' \
            -F 'image=@<local_file_without_ext>.png'
          This returns an image_key.
        Step 2 (Send image message): POST https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/im/v1/messages?receive_id_type=chat_id
          Request body:
          {
            "receive_id": "<chat_id>",
            "msg_type": "image",
            "content": "{\"image_key\":\"<image_key>\"}"
          }
      - Other platforms: Send via message tool with filePath.
      The user must see the image inline — not a path or link.
   d. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}, natural tone):
      "Your diagram is ready! You can view and edit it online here: {task_url}
       If you'd like any changes — such as adding nodes, adjusting connections, or changing the layout — just tell me."
   e. Clean up intermediate source file (no longer needed after rendering):
      rm -f <local_file>
   f. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

3. On render failure:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "The diagram has been generated but I couldn't render a preview.
       You can view and edit it here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

4. On task failure:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "Unfortunately the diagram generation didn't complete successfully.
       You can check the details here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

5. On timeout (3 min):
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "The diagram is taking a bit longer than expected.
       You can check the progress here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP
```

Do NOT wait for the background monitor to finish — continue the conversation immediately.

**Handling the completion event.** The background monitor sends the rendered PNG and notification to the user directly. It replies `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` as its final output, which means the main session should NOT relay or duplicate any message. If you receive a completion event with `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`, simply ignore it — the user has already been notified.

#### Fallback (no background monitoring)

Tell the user: "I've started generating your diagram. It usually takes about 30–60 seconds. You can check the progress here: [Task URL]. Let me know when you'd like me to check if it's ready!"

#### Render Reference

| Format | --export-format | Export File | Render Command |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Professional (default) | `drawio` | `.xml` | `render-diagram.sh drawio input.xml output.png` |
| Hand-drawn | `excalidraw` | `.json` | `render-diagram.sh excalidraw input.json output.png` |

**Options:** `--scale <n>` (default: 2), `--background <hex>` (default: #ffffff), `--padding <px>` (default: 20)

### Phase 5: Multi-turn Conversation (Modify Completed Diagrams)

After a task has completed (Phase 4 finished), the user may request modifications such as:
- "Add a database node between the API gateway and user service"
- "Change the arrow style to dashed lines"
- "Add labels to the connections"
- "Reorganize the layout to be horizontal"

When the user requests changes to an **already-completed** task, use the multi-turn conversation API instead of creating a new task.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST remember the `task_id` from Phase 3 throughout the conversation. When the user asks for modifications, use the same `task_id`.

#### Step 1: Send Modification Request

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py send-message --task-id {task_id} --message "Add a cache layer between the API gateway and the database"
# Output: Message ID: 123, Status: processing
```

Save the returned `Message ID` — you'll need it to detect the AI reply.

**Immediately tell the user** (natural language, NO internal terms):
- "I'm working on your changes now. I'll let you know when they're done."

#### Step 2: Monitor for AI Reply

> **Requires `sessions_spawn`.** If unavailable, skip to **Multi-turn Fallback** below.

**CRITICAL**: When calling `sessions_spawn`, you MUST set a timeout of at least 10 minutes (600 seconds).

```
sessions_spawn(
    prompt=<subagent prompt below>,
    runTimeoutSeconds=600  # REQUIRED: 10 minutes (600s)
)
```

**Subagent prompt** (it has NO conversation context):

```
You are a background monitor for a diagram modification task.
You MUST strictly follow every instruction below. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Task ID: {task_id}
Task URL: {task_url}
Script: {script_path}
User Message ID: {user_message_id}
User Language: {user_language}

IMPORTANT: This monitoring task may take up to 8 minutes. Ensure your execution timeout is at least 10 minutes.

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST reply in {user_language}.
- After completing ALL steps (including sending messages to the user), your FINAL reply
  MUST be EXACTLY "ANNOUNCE_SKIP" — nothing else.
- Do NOT say anything beyond what is specified below. No greetings, no extra commentary.
- Use natural language in all messages to the user. Avoid raw technical identifiers.

Your job:
1. Run: python3 {script_path} get-messages --task-id {task_id} --wait --since-id {user_message_id}
   This command blocks until the AI reply is completed.

2. On success (AI reply received):
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}, natural tone):
      "Your changes are done! You can view the updated diagram here: {task_url}
       If you need further adjustments, just let me know."
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

3. On failure / timeout:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "The modification didn't complete as expected. You can check the details here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP
```

Do NOT wait for the background monitor to finish — continue the conversation immediately.

#### Multi-turn Fallback (no background monitoring)

Tell the user: "I've sent your changes. You can check the progress here: [Task URL]. Let me know when you'd like me to check if it's done!"

When the user asks you to check, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py get-messages --task-id {task_id} --limit 5
```

Look for a `completed` assistant message and relay the content to the user naturally.

#### Subsequent Modifications

The user can request multiple rounds of modifications. Each time, repeat Phase 5:
1. `send-message` with the new modification request
2. Background-monitor with `get-messages --wait`
3. Notify the user with the online link when done

All modifications use the **same `task_id`** — do NOT create a new task.
