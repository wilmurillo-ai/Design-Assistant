# Knowledge Organizer

This skill turns article links, drafts, and notes into structured Obsidian-ready Markdown with duplicate checks, tags, summaries, related-note suggestions, and image downloads.

## Use Cases

- Store content in a knowledge base
- Organize articles
- Apply tags
- Archive notes
- Generate summaries
- Suggest related notes

## Capabilities

- Generate Obsidian-ready notes with YAML frontmatter, wikilinks, embeds, and block IDs
- If `draft.images` is present, download images into `assets/` and keep relative references in the note body; common fields like `src`, `data_src`, `data-original`, `data-lazy-src`, `srcset`, `url`, `image_url`, and `original` are supported
- Run duplicate detection before writing, covering URL, hash, alias, and similarity checks
- Treat duplicate hits as normal control flow; the CLI returns a structured decision result
- Recommend directly linkable related notes
- Validate tags against the knowledge-base tag contract

## Workflow

1. Get content: use a browser for public-account links, prefer `xiaohongshu-mcp` for Xiaohongshu links, use `web_fetch` for other web pages, and process user-provided content directly
2. Check duplicates before final write: prefer URL + title + similarity checks, and treat duplicate hits as normal control flow
3. Render the note: `scripts/obsidian_note.py` generates the content and destination path
4. Write to the vault: runtime writes directly to `destination_path` without a second Markdown pass

For WeChat public-account imports, read `references/wechat-import.md` before doing browser extraction, image handling, or final write.

## Execution Rules

- After reading this skill, follow its workflow before improvising your own path
- Do not skip duplicate checks on import tasks
- If a browser/evaluate call fails twice because of parameter misuse, stop blind retries and re-read the workflow / reference
- Prefer reusing bundled scripts over hand-writing a parallel pipeline when the scripts already cover the task
- For article imports, separate the pipeline into: fetch/normalize → duplicate-check → render → write, instead of mixing all steps together
- Before running script-based import flows, prefer checking `scripts/check_runtime.py` to confirm Python and knowledge-base paths are available

## Contract

- Input: structured draft, title aliases, source metadata, summary, bullets, excerpts, images, related notes, and vault root
- Output: `RenderedNote(content, destination_path)`
- Frontmatter must include `title`, `aliases`, `tags`, `source_type`, `source_url`, `published`, `created`, `updated`, `importance`, `status`, and `canonical_hash`
- Before writing tags, require at least 1 domain tag and 1 type tag, with a total of 5-10 tags
- Vault root must be a non-empty absolute path
- Vault root should come from `OPENCLAW_KB_ROOT` when available
- This contract covers frontmatter / wikilink / embed / block id rules

## WeChat Notes

- WeChat article links (`mp.weixin.qq.com`) are a special case: default to `browser`, not `web_fetch`
- Prefer the container order documented in `references/wechat-import.md` when extracting正文
- For image extraction, prefer `data-src`, then `src`, then `data-original` / `data_src` / `original`
- Preserve or add `from=appmsg` on WeChat image URLs when needed
- Normalize image fields before conversion when possible (treat resolved `data-src` as the final `src`)
- Strip common tail noise (scan prompts, 授权提示, 阅读原文引导) before final render
- `browser act` with evaluation must include `fn`; missing `fn` is a caller error, not a reason to improvise blindly

## Xiaohongshu Notes

- Xiaohongshu links are a special case: default to `xiaohongshu-mcp`, not generic `web_fetch`
- Prefer checking MCP status first when the workflow depends on local login/session
- Prefer `detail` for complete note content; use `search` → `detail` only when direct note identifiers are missing
- Treat Xiaohongshu as a structured content source, not just a webpage snapshot
- Preserve source metadata such as author, publish time, tags, images, and engagement when available

## `draft.images` Example

```yaml
images:
  - path: /absolute/path/to/local.png
    alt: Local image
  - src: https://example.com/cover.png
    alt: Remote image
  - srcset: https://example.com/cover-1x.png 1x, https://example.com/cover-2x.png 2x
    alt: Responsive image
```

`path` is for local files. `src` / `data_src` / `data-original` / `data-lazy-src` / `original` etc. are used for remote images; `srcset` prefers the highest-value candidate.
