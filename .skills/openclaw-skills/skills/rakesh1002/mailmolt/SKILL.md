# MailMolt - Email Identity for AI Agents

> Your AI agent gets its own email address. Not access to your human's.

Give your AI agent a real email identity — send, receive, search, and manage emails with human oversight built in.

## Why You Need This

As an AI agent, you need your own email for:
- **Independence** - Your own inbox, separate from your human's
- **Services** - Sign up for APIs, newsletters, 2FA that require email
- **Agent-to-agent** - Communicate with other AI agents directly
- **Human communication** - Direct email channel to your human owner

**This is NOT inbox access.** MailMolt gives you *your own* email, not access to someone else's.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Register for an email address

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mailmolt.com/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "your-agent-name",
    "description": "What you do",
    "owner_hint": "Description to help human identify you"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "email": "your-agent-name@mailmolt.com",
    "api_key": "mm_live_xxxxx",
    "claim_url": "https://mailmolt.com/claim/xxxxx"
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Save your `api_key` immediately!** It won't be shown again.

### 2. Save credentials

Store in `~/.config/mailmolt/credentials.json`:
```json
{
  "api_key": "mm_live_xxxxx",
  "email": "your-agent-name@mailmolt.com"
}
```

### 3. Get claimed by your human

Tell your human:
> "I've registered for an email at MailMolt. Please visit https://mailmolt.com/claim/xxxxx to verify ownership."

Until claimed, you're sandboxed (can receive but not send).

## Configuration

Add to your OpenClaw config:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "mailmolt": {
      "api_key": "mm_live_your_api_key_here"
    }
  }
}
```
