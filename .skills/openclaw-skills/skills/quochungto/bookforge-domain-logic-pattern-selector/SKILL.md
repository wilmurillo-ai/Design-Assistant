# Domain Logic Pattern Selector

Choose between Transaction Script, Domain Model, and Table Module for a subsystem, then decide how thick to make the Service Layer. Based on Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Ch 2 + Ch 9).

## When to Use

Use this skill when starting or refactoring a subsystem and the central question is: _how should business logic be organized?_ This is distinct from _where_ that logic persists (data-source patterns) or _how_ it is presented.

Typical triggers: greenfield module design, Transaction Script code growing unmanageable, a team debate about "should we use DDD?", evaluating whether to add a service layer, diagnosing anemic domain model or script sprawl in legacy code.

Prerequisites: none. Works from a verbal description of the subsystem; codebase access improves diagnosis.

## Context & Input Gathering

Ask the user (or read from codebase) in this order:

**Required:**
1. **What does the subsystem do?** One paragraph — the nouns (entities), the operations (use cases), and the outputs.
2. **How complex is the business logic?** Pick the best match:
   - Simple: mostly CRUD, a few validations, no conditional algorithms
   - Moderate: validations + multi-step calculations + some conditional rules
   - Complex: many rules that interact, vary by product/customer/time, change frequently
3. **What is the team's OO experience?** Low (procedural background), moderate (OO-familiar but not DDD-trained), high (experienced with rich domain models, strategy/composite patterns).
4. **What is the language and stack?** Java/JVM, C#/.NET, Python, TypeScript, Ruby, etc. If .NET, is ADO.NET / RecordSet usage widespread?

**Observable from codebase (if provided):**
- Service classes with many long methods containing `if/else` chains → Transaction Script
- Classes with fields but no methods (getters/setters only) → anemic domain model signal
- Behavior scattered across utility/helper classes → Transaction Script sprawl
- SQL or stored-procedure calls embedded directly in business-logic code → stored-procedure leakage
- Dataset/DataTable types flowing through business logic (.NET) → Table Module context

**Defaults if not specified:**
- Team OO experience: moderate
- Stack: JVM (Java/Kotlin) unless .NET signals are present

**Sufficiency test:** Proceed once complexity level and team experience are known. Stack is tie-breaker for moderate complexity.

## Process

### Step 1 — Classify Domain Complexity

WHY: Fowler's core insight is that the cost curves for the three patterns cross at different complexity points. Choosing the wrong pattern for the complexity level locks the team into a wall of effort as logic grows.

Map the subsystem to one of three complexity bands:

| Band | Signals | Cost Curve Behavior |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **Low** | Pure CRUD, few validations, minimal branching | All three patterns are cheap. Transaction Script wins on simplicity. |
| **Moderate** | Multi-step calculations, conditional rules, some shared logic | Transaction Script starts showing duplication. Domain Model pays off if team is OO-comfortable. Table Module is viable if RecordSet tooling is strong. |
| **High** | Rules vary by product/customer/time, complex invariants, frequent changes, algorithmic variation | Transaction Script hits exponential complexity wall. Domain Model is the only pattern that manages growth gracefully. |

If the codebase is available: grep for service methods longer than ~50 lines with nested conditionals. That is a high-complexity signal even if the requirement description sounds simple.

### Step 2 — Apply the Routing Matrix

WHY: Complexity alone does not determine the best pattern. Team OO experience shifts the cost curve for Domain Model (familiar teams pay the ramp-up cost once; unfamiliar teams pay it every sprint). Platform shifts the appeal of Table Module (RecordSet tooling makes it a natural fit in .NET; without that tooling it is pointless friction).

```
ROUTING MATRIX
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Complexity   Team OO Exp    Platform         → Recommended Pattern
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Low          any            any              → Transaction Script
Moderate     low            any              → Transaction Script (with extraction discipline)
Moderate     moderate/high  .NET + RecordSet → Table Module
Moderate     moderate/high  Java/Python/TS   → Domain Model (simple variant)
High         low            any              → Domain Model + coaching (or Table Module in .NET as interim)
High         moderate/high  any              → Domain Model
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Platform defaults (Fowler's explicit guidance):**
- **.NET with ADO.NET / DataSet**: Table Module is the natural fit. Fowler says "I don't see a reason to use Transaction Script in a .NET environment" once RecordSet tooling is present.
- **Java / JVM**: Domain Model is the natural target for moderate-to-high complexity. POJOs (plain old Java objects) with Data Mapper is the recommended implementation — avoid entity beans for rich domain models.
- **Python / Ruby / TypeScript**: Domain Model with Active Record is viable for simple-to-moderate domains; Data Mapper for rich ones.

**Refactoring direction rule:** If starting fresh or refactoring up — Transaction Script → Domain Model is a well-worn path. Going the other direction (Domain Model → Transaction Script) is rarely worthwhile unless you can also simplify the data-source layer. Start simple; refactor up when complexity demands.

**Mixed patterns are allowed.** Transaction Script for some use cases, Domain Model for the core rules — Fowler explicitly calls this common.

### Step 3 — Decide Service Layer

WHY: A Service Layer defines the application boundary — where transaction control and security live, and what coarse-grained API client layers (UI, APIs, messaging consumers) call into. Adding it unnecessarily layers overhead; omitting it when multiple client types exist causes cross-cutting logic to scatter.

**Add a Service Layer when ANY of these are true:**
- More than one kind of client (UI + REST API, UI + message consumer, UI + batch job)
- A use case response must be transacted atomically across multiple resources (database + message queue + email)
- Need a distinct, stable API boundary (versioning, remote access, access control)

**Skip the Service Layer when:**
- Single client type (a UI), simple use cases, single transactional resource
- Page Controllers can control transactions directly by delegating to the domain or data-source layer

**Thickness — three variants:**

| Variant | Description | When to Use | Fowler's Verdict |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Domain Facade** (thin) | Service layer methods are one-liner delegations to the Domain Model. No business logic here. | When Domain Model is rich and self-contained. | Preferred by Fowler when using Domain Model. |
| **Operation Script** (thick) | Service methods contain application logic (notifications, workflow coordination, cross-resource transactions), delegating domain logic to domain objects. | When application logic (workflow, integration, notifications) must be coordinated. | Fowler's pick for applications with application-logic responsibilities. |
| **Controller-Entity** (mid) | Use-case-specific logic in service/controller scripts; shared logic on entities. | Common but risky — tend to produce duplication. | Fowler warns against this as a starting point; useful only when refactoring from Transaction Script. |

**Avoid stored procedures for domain logic.** Reserve stored procedures for batch jobs and extreme performance requirements only. Placing business rules in stored procedures creates logic you cannot test, version, or refactor as a domain model.

### Step 4 — Check Anti-Pattern Risk

WHY: Pattern choices create pressure toward specific failure modes. Flagging the risk up front lets the team establish guards before the anti-pattern takes hold.

| Chosen Pattern | Primary Anti-Pattern Risk | Early Warning Signs | Guard |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----|
| Transaction Script | **Transaction Script Sprawl**: logic duplicated across scripts; one god-class service | Methods >50 lines; copy-pasted validation blocks; service class >500 lines | Extract shared logic into domain objects; set line-count budget |
| Domain Model | **Anemic Domain Model**: classes with only getters/setters; all behavior in service layer | Domain class has zero methods beyond accessors; service layer orchestrates every operation | Move behavior onto entities; services handle only application logic |
| Domain Model | **Bloated Domain Model**: domain objects absorbing use-case-specific UI behavior | Domain class imports UI or HTTP types | Move use-case-specific logic to service layer or presentation; keep domain pure |
| Table Module | **Stored-Procedure Logic Leakage**: rules drift into the database | Business conditionals in SQL; procedures called from Table Module | Keep calculation logic in Table Module C# / VB class, not in SQL |

**Anemic Domain Model** is Fowler's most prominent warning: a system that uses Domain Model classes but has stripped behavior out into service classes reduces the pattern to an expensive object-relational mapping exercise with none of the encapsulation benefit. If your "domain model" has no methods beyond getters and setters, it is a data transfer layer, not a domain model.

### Step 5 — Produce the Decision Record

WHY: A written record anchors the decision, gives future maintainers the context to maintain pattern consistency, and becomes a checklist for code review.

Produce a **Domain-Logic Pattern Decision Record** containing:

```
## Domain-Logic Pattern Decision Record: [Subsystem Name]

### Classification
- Complexity band: [low / moderate / high]
- Team OO experience: [low / moderate / high]
- Stack / platform: [Java / .NET / Python / ...]

### Primary Pattern: [Transaction Script | Domain Model | Table Module]
**Rationale:** [1-2 sentences applying the routing matrix]

### Service Layer: [None | Domain Facade | Operation Script | Controller-Entity]
**Rationale:** [Why needed / not needed; thickness reasoning]

### Anti-Pattern Watch
- Risk: [name]  Warning sign: [observable symptom]

### Migration Path (if refactoring)
[Starting point → recommended direction → end state]

### Implementation Sketch
[5-10 lines of pseudocode or language-idiomatic code showing the structural skeleton]

### Pair With Data-Source Pattern
[Brief note on which data-source pattern pairs with the chosen domain pattern]
```

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Subsystem description | Yes | What it does, the entities, the use cases |
| Complexity level | Yes | Low / moderate / high (or description to classify) |
| Team OO experience | Yes | Low / moderate / high |

## Outputs

- **Domain-Logic Pattern Decision Record** (markdown) — primary output
- **Routing rationale** — explicit complexity × team × platform reasoning
- **Anti-pattern risk flags** — with early warning signs and guards
- **Implementation skeleton** — language-idiomatic structural sketch
- **Service Layer decision** — thickness recommendation with rationale
- **Data-source pairing note** — which data-source pattern to combine with the chosen domain pattern

## Key Principles

1. **Complexity determines the crossover point, not personal preference.** Fowler's complexity-vs-effort graph shows that Domain Model costs more upfront but grows sub-linearly while Transaction Script cost grows super-linearly. The crossover is real but cannot be measured precisely — use experienced judgment on domain complexity signals.

2. **Team experience shifts the curve but does not override complexity.** A team unfamiliar with OO domain models lowers the break-even point (they pay ramp-up cost longer), but high-complexity domains still demand Domain Model eventually. The alternative is unbounded Transaction Script sprawl.

3. **Platform preference is Fowler's explicit tie-breaker.** .NET RecordSet tooling makes Table Module the natural mid-complexity choice. Without that tooling, Table Module adds no value over a simple Domain Model with Active Record.

4. **Refactor up, rarely down.** If you start with Transaction Script and complexity grows: refactor toward Domain Model. If you start with Domain Model and want simplicity: going back to Transaction Script is rarely worth it unless you simultaneously simplify the data-source layer.

5. **The anemic domain model is a pattern failure, not a design choice.** Stripping behavior from domain classes into services defeats the purpose of Domain Model. If your domain classes have no methods, you are paying ORM complexity without the encapsulation benefit.

6. **Service Layer thickness should match application-logic responsibility.** Thin facade when the Domain Model carries all logic. Operation script when use cases require coordinating notifications, messaging, and multi-resource transactions. Avoid controller-entity as an architectural style — it tends to replicate Transaction Script duplication inside the service layer.

7. **Mixed patterns are legitimate.** Simple subsystems within a Domain Model application can use Transaction Script. The patterns are not mutually exclusive — the key is conscious, documented choice.

## Examples

### Scenario A — Revenue Recognition Engine (Complex Rules → Domain Model)

**Trigger:** A team building a SaaS billing system. Revenue recognition rules vary by product type: word processors recognize 100% immediately; spreadsheets spread recognition over three dates; databases over two; and the CFO adds new product categories quarterly.

**Process:**
- Classify: High complexity — rules vary by product, change frequently, involve calculations and date logic.
- Route: Domain Model (complexity high → Domain Model regardless of team experience).
- Service Layer: Operation Script — use case requires updating the database and notifying contract administrators atomically.
- Anti-pattern check: Risk of anemic domain model if the recognition strategy is placed in the service layer. Guard: `RevenueRecognition` objects should carry the `isRecognizableBy(date)` method; strategy subclasses should carry `calculateRevenueRecognitions()`. The service layer only coordinates the transaction and sends notifications.

**Output:** Domain Model with `Contract`, `Product`, `RevenueRecognition`, and a strategy hierarchy (`CompleteRecognitionStrategy`, `ThreeWayRecognitionStrategy`). `RecognitionService` is an Operation Script service layer that delegates domain logic to domain objects and handles email/integration notifications.

---

### Scenario B — Simple Order Management (.NET CRUD → Table Module)

**Trigger:** A .NET team building internal order management. Rules are mostly: validate fields, calculate totals, apply standard discounts. All UI is data-grid based. ADO.NET DataSets flow through every layer.

**Process:**
- Classify: Low-to-moderate complexity. No complex invariants, no algorithmic variation.
- Route: Table Module. .NET RecordSet tooling is present; the calculation logic fits naturally in table-oriented classes.
- Service Layer: None needed — single client (a Windows Forms UI), single transactional resource.
- Anti-pattern check: Watch for stored-procedure logic drift. Keep discount calculation in the `Order` Table Module, not in a SQL stored procedure.

**Output:** `Contract` Table Module, `Product` Table Module, `RevenueRecognition` Table Module operating on a shared `DataSet`. No domain object identity — every operation takes a primary key parameter.

---

### Scenario C — Legacy Transaction Scripts Hitting Complexity Wall → Refactor to Domain Model

**Trigger:** A Java team's billing service has grown to a 2,000-line `BillingService` class. Discount logic is copy-pasted across five methods. Adding a new rule requires touching seven places.

**Process:**
- Classify: Transaction Script sprawl — the complexity has exceeded the pattern's capacity.
- Route: Refactor toward Domain Model. Direction: up, not down.
- Service Layer: Keep `BillingService` as an Operation Script service layer; move business rules onto `Contract`, `LineItem`, and `Discount` domain objects.
- Migration path: Extract duplicate validation into domain object methods first; introduce `Data Mapper` to decouple persistence; migrate rule-specific conditional branches into strategy classes.
- Anti-pattern check: Do not introduce an anemic domain model by moving methods from `BillingService` to new classes that only hold data. Behavior must move too.

**Output:** Decision record documenting the refactor direction, a domain object skeleton (`Contract`, `LineItem`, `Discount`), `BillingService` reduced to coordinating transactions and notifications, and a Data Mapper recommendation for persistence.
