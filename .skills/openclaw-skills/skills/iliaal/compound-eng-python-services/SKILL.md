# Python Services & CLI

## Modern Tooling

| Tool | Replaces | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **uv** | pip, virtualenv, pyenv, pipx | Package/dependency management |
| **ruff** | flake8, black, isort | Linting + formatting |
| **ty** | mypy, pyright | Type checking (Astral, faster) |

- `uv init --package myproject` for distributable packages, `uv init` for apps
- `uv add <pkg>`, `uv add --group dev <pkg>`, never edit pyproject.toml deps manually
- `uv run <cmd>` instead of activating venvs -- auto-activates the venv without explicit activation
- `uv add --upgrade <pkg>` to upgrade a single package without touching others
- `uv tree --outdated` to preview what would be upgraded before committing
- `uv.lock` goes in version control
- Use `[dependency-groups]` (PEP 735) for dev/test/docs, not `[project.optional-dependencies]`
- PEP 723 inline metadata for standalone scripts with deps
- `ruff check --fix . && ruff format .` for lint+format in one pass

**Standard project layout:**
```
src/mypackage/
    __init__.py
    main.py
    services/
    models/
tests/
    conftest.py
    test_main.py
pyproject.toml
```

See [cli-tools.md](./references/cli-tools.md) for Click patterns, argparse, and CLI project layout.

## Parallelism

| Workload | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Many concurrent I/O calls | `asyncio` (gather, create_task) |
| CPU-bound computation | `multiprocessing.Pool` or `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` |
| Mixed I/O + CPU | `asyncio.to_thread()` to offload blocking work |
| Simple scripts, few connections | Stay synchronous |

### Sync vs Async Decision

**Use async (asyncio) when:**
- I/O-bound work has multiple concurrent operations (HTTP calls, database queries, file I/O happening in parallel)
- WebSocket servers or long-lived connections require it
- The framework requires it (FastAPI async endpoints, aiohttp)

**Stay synchronous when:**
- Work is CPU-bound (computation, data transformation) -- async adds nothing, use multiprocessing instead
- Building simple scripts and CLI tools with sequential I/O
- All I/O is sequential anyway (one DB query, process result, one API call)
- The team lacks async debugging experience (asyncio stack traces are harder to read)

**Rule of thumb:** if the code is not waiting on multiple I/O operations concurrently, sync is simpler and correct. Do not add async complexity for a single sequential pipeline.

**Key rule:** Stay fully sync or fully async within a call path.

**asyncio patterns:**
- `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` for concurrent I/O -- use `return_exceptions=True` for partial failure tolerance
- `asyncio.TaskGroup` (3.11+) for structured concurrency -- automatic cancellation of sibling tasks on failure; prefer over `gather` when all tasks must succeed
- `asyncio.Semaphore(n)` to limit concurrency (rate limiting external APIs)
- `asyncio.wait_for(coro, timeout=N)` for timeouts
- `asyncio.Queue` for producer-consumer
- `asyncio.Lock` when coroutines share mutable state
- Never block the event loop: `asyncio.to_thread(sync_fn)` for sync libs, `aiohttp`/`httpx.AsyncClient` for HTTP
- Handle `CancelledError` -- always re-raise after cleanup
- Async generators (`async for`) for streaming/pagination

**multiprocessing** for CPU-bound:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as pool:
    results = list(pool.map(cpu_task, items))
```

See [fastapi.md](./references/fastapi.md) for project structure, lifespan, config, DI, async DB, and repository pattern.

## Background Jobs

- Return job ID immediately, process async. Client polls `/jobs/{id}` for status
- **Celery**: `@app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3, autoretry_for=(ConnectionError,))` -- exponential backoff: `raise self.retry(countdown=2**self.request.retries * 60)`
- **Alternatives**: Dramatiq (modern Celery), RQ (simple Redis), cloud-native (SQS+Lambda, Cloud Tasks)
- **Idempotency is mandatory** -- tasks may retry. Use idempotency keys for external calls, check-before-write, upsert patterns
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed tasks after max retries
- Task workflows: `chain(a.s(), b.s())` for sequential, `group(...)` for parallel, `chord(group, callback)` for fan-out/fan-in

## Resilience

**Retries with tenacity:**
```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential_jitter, retry_if_exception_type

@retry(
    retry=retry_if_exception_type((ConnectionError, TimeoutError)),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(5) | stop_after_delay(60),
    wait=wait_exponential_jitter(initial=1, max=30),
    before_sleep=log_retry_attempt,
)
def call_api(url: str) -> dict: ...
```

- Retry only transient errors: network, 429/502/503/504. Never retry 4xx (except 429), auth errors, validation errors
- Every network call needs a timeout
- `@fail_safe(default=[])` decorator for non-critical paths -- return cached/default on failure
- `functools.lru_cache(maxsize=N)` for pure-function memoization; `functools.cache` (unbounded) for small domains
- Stack decorators: `@traced @with_timeout(30) @retry(...)` -- separate infra from business logic

**Connection pooling** is mandatory for production: reuse `httpx.AsyncClient()` across requests, configure SQLAlchemy `pool_size`/`max_overflow`, use `aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=N)`.

## Production Resilience

- **Fail-fast config validation**: use a Pydantic `BaseSettings` model with `model_validator` to parse and validate all environment variables at startup. If invalid, crash before serving traffic. Never discover a missing secret on the first request that needs it.
- **Health endpoints**: expose `/health` (shallow liveness -- returns 200 if the process responds) and `/ready` (deep readiness -- verifies database, Redis, and critical dependencies are reachable). Load balancers route traffic based on `/ready`; orchestrators restart based on `/health`.

## Observability

- **structlog** for JSON structured logging. Configure once at startup with `JSONRenderer`, `TimeStamper`, `merge_contextvars`
- **Correlation IDs** -- generate at ingress (`X-Correlation-ID` header), bind to `contextvars`, propagate to downstream calls
- **Log levels**: DEBUG=diagnostics, INFO=operations, WARNING=anomalies handled, ERROR=failures needing attention. Never log expected behavior at ERROR
- **Prometheus metrics** -- track latency (Histogram), traffic (Counter), errors (Counter), saturation (Gauge). Keep label cardinality bounded (no user IDs)
- **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing across services

## Discipline

- Simplicity first -- every change as simple as possible, impact minimal code
- Only touch what's necessary -- avoid introducing unrelated changes
- No hacky workarounds -- if a fix feels wrong, step back and implement the clean solution
- Before adding a new abstraction, verify it appears in 3+ places. If not, inline it.
- Verify: see Verify section below -- pass all checks with zero warnings before declaring done
- Coverage target: 80%+ (`uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=html`)

## Testing Patterns

- **pytest flags**: `--lf` (last failed), `-x` (stop on first failure), `-k "pattern"` (filter), `--pdb` (debugger on failure)
- **Fixtures**: use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures. Scope wisely: `@pytest.fixture(scope="session")` for expensive setup (DB connections), `scope="function"` (default) for test isolation
- **`tmp_path`**: built-in fixture for temp files -- no manual cleanup needed
- **Parametrize with IDs**: `@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [...], ids=["empty", "single", "overflow"])` for readable test names
- **Mock discipline**: always `autospec=True` on mocks to catch API drift. `assert_awaited_once()` for async mocks.
- **Test markers**: register in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with `markers = ["slow", "integration"]`. Run fast tests with `-m "not slow"`.
- **Protocol duck typing**: use `class Renderable(Protocol)` for structural typing at service boundaries -- enables testing with plain objects instead of mocks
- **Context managers**: `@contextmanager` for connection/transaction lifecycle. Always implement `__exit__` cleanup.

## Error Handling

- Validate inputs at boundaries before expensive ops. Report all errors at once when possible
- Use specific exceptions: `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`, not bare `Exception`
- `raise ServiceError("upload failed") from e` -- always chain to preserve debug trail
- Convert external data to domain types (enums, Pydantic models) at system boundaries
- Batch processing: `BatchResult(succeeded={}, failed={})` -- don't let one item abort the batch
- Pydantic `BaseModel` with `field_validator` for complex input validation

## Migrations

- Separate schema and data migrations -- data backfills in their own migration file
- Renames/removals use expand-contract: add new column → backfill → switch reads → drop old (see `postgresql` skill for the full pattern)
- Never edit a migration that has already run in a shared environment
- Alembic: use `--autogenerate` as a starting point, always review generated SQL before committing
- Test migrations against production-sized data -- a migration that takes 2ms on dev can lock a table for minutes in production

## API Design

- **Contract-first**: define Pydantic `BaseModel` request/response schemas and FastAPI `response_model` before writing endpoint logic. The schema is the contract -- implementation follows. Generate OpenAPI docs from these models automatically.
- **Hyrum's Law awareness**: every observable response field, ordering, or timing becomes a dependency for callers. Use explicit `response_model` and `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` to control exactly what's serialized -- never return raw dicts or ORM objects from endpoints.
- **Addition over modification**: add new optional fields (`field: str | None = None`) rather than changing or removing existing ones. Removing a Pydantic field from a response model breaks callers silently. Deprecate first (`Field(deprecated=True)`), remove in a later version.
- **Consistent error structure**: all exceptions should produce the same envelope: `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "details": ...}}`. Register `@app.exception_handler` for `RequestValidationError`, `HTTPException`, and application-specific exceptions to normalize into one format. Callers build error handling once.
- **Boundary validation via Pydantic**: validate at the endpoint/handler level with Pydantic models and FastAPI's automatic request parsing. Internal services and repositories trust that input was validated at entry -- no redundant validation scattered through business logic.
- **Third-party responses are untrusted data**: validate shape and content of external API responses before using them in logic, rendering, or decision-making. A compromised or misbehaving service can return unexpected types, malicious content, or missing fields. Parse through a Pydantic model before use.
