# React Frontend

**Verify before implementing**: For App Router patterns, React 19 APIs, or version-specific behavior, search current docs via `search_docs` before writing code. Training data may lag current releases.

## Component TypeScript

- Extend native elements with `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'>`, add custom props via intersection
- Use `React.ReactNode` for children, `React.ReactElement` for single element, render prop `(data: T) => ReactNode`
- Discriminated unions for variant props -- TypeScript narrows automatically in branches
- Generic components: `<T>` with `keyof T` for column keys, `T extends { id: string }` for constraints
- Event types: `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`, `FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>`, `ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`
- `as const` for custom hook tuple returns
- `useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)` for DOM (use `?.`), `useRef<number>(0)` for mutable values
- Explicit `useState<User | null>(null)` for unions/null
- useReducer actions as discriminated unions: `{ type: 'set'; payload: number } | { type: 'reset' }`
- useContext null guard: throw in custom `useX()` hook if context is null

## Effects Decision Tree

Effects are escape hatches -- most logic should NOT use effects.

| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Derived value from props/state | Calculate during render (useMemo if expensive) |
| Reset state on prop change | `key` prop on component |
| Respond to user event | Event handler |
| Notify parent of state change | Call onChange in event handler, or fully controlled component |
| Chain of state updates | Calculate all next state in one event handler |
| Sync with external system | Effect with cleanup |

**Effect rules:**
- Never suppress the linter -- fix the code instead
- Use updater functions (`setItems(prev => [...prev, item])`) to remove state dependencies
- Move objects/functions inside effects to stabilize dependencies
- `useEffectEvent` for non-reactive values (e.g., theme in a connection effect)
- Always return cleanup for subscriptions, connections, listeners
- Data fetching cancellation (pick by situation): `AbortController` for fetch; `ignore` flag for non-cancellable promises; React Query handles both automatically

## Concurrency & Race Classes

Frontend bugs that survive type-checking and unit tests usually land in one of five race classes. Hunt each one explicitly during review:

1. **Lifecycle cleanup gaps** -- in-production signal: "Can't perform state update on an unmounted component" warnings, slow-burn memory leaks under rapid navigation, duplicate event handlers firing. Root cause: `useEffect` registered a listener/timer/observer without returning cleanup (see Effect rules above for the rule).
2. **Remount-timing mistakes** -- async callbacks mutate DOM or state after swap / disconnect / route change. Classic cases: a `fetch().then(setData)` resolves after navigation to a different route; a `requestAnimationFrame` fires after the parent unmounts. See "Data fetching" in Effect rules for the cancellation hierarchy (AbortController for fetch; ignore-flag for non-cancellable promises; React Query handles both automatically).
3. **Boolean-as-state for UI that isn't binary** -- `isLoading: boolean` can't represent `idle | loading | success | error | retry` without creating inconsistent combinations (`isLoading: true, error: Error` is contradictory). Prefer an explicit state constant (`'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'`) with a transition function so invalid states are unreachable.
4. **Stale promises and timers with no cancel path** -- a promise chain or `setTimeout` holds a reference to `setState` after the component's moved on. Bind every async operation to a cancel mechanism (`AbortController`, cleanup function, `ignore` flag) and verify the cleanup path is exercised by a test.
5. **Per-element handlers where delegation would be safer** -- attaching `onClick` to every row in a list creates N closures and N subscriptions; delegated listeners (single handler on the parent reading `event.target.closest(...)`) are safer under rapid re-renders, avoid stale-closure bugs, and scale to large lists. Use delegation when the list exceeds ~50 items or updates frequently.

These classes produce bugs that are intermittent, environment-dependent, and invisible to type-checking -- exactly the ones that reach production. Review for them deliberately, not just as "subscriptions need cleanup."

## State Management

```
Local UI state       → useState, useReducer
Shared client state  → Zustand (simple) | Redux Toolkit (complex)
Atomic/granular      → Jotai
Server/remote data   → React Query (TanStack Query)
URL state            → nuqs, router search params
Form state           → React Hook Form
```

**Key patterns:**
- Zustand: `create<State>()(devtools(persist((set) => ({...}))))` -- use slices for scale, selective subscriptions to prevent re-renders
- React Query: query keys factory (`['users', 'detail', id] as const`), `staleTime`/`gcTime`, optimistic updates with `onMutate`/`onError` rollback
- Separate client state (Zustand) from server state (React Query) -- never duplicate server data in client store
- Colocate state close to where it's used; don't over-globalize

## Performance

**Critical -- eliminate waterfalls:**
- `Promise.all()` for independent async operations
- Move `await` into branches where actually needed
- Suspense boundaries to stream slow content

**Critical -- bundle size:**
- Import directly from modules, avoid barrel files (`index.ts` re-exports)
- `next/dynamic` or `React.lazy()` for heavy components
- Defer third-party scripts (analytics, logging) until after hydration
- Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed
- `content-visibility: auto` + `contain-intrinsic-size` on long lists -- skips off-screen layout/paint

**Re-render optimization:**
- Derive state during render, not in effects
- Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw objects (`state.items.length > 0` not `state.items`)
- Functional setState for stable callbacks: `setCount(c => c + 1)`
- Lazy state init: `useState(() => expensiveComputation())`
- `useTransition` for non-urgent updates (search filtering)
- `useDeferredValue` for expensive derived UI
- Don't subscribe to searchParams/state if only read in callbacks -- read on demand instead
- Use ternary (`condition ? <A /> : <B />`), not `&&` for conditionals
- `React.memo` only for expensive subtrees with stable props
- Hoist static JSX outside components

**React Compiler** (React 19): auto-memoizes -- write idiomatic React, remove manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo`. Enable via framework config (Next.js: `reactCompiler: true` in next.config). Non-framework: install `babel-plugin-react-compiler`. Keep components pure.

## React 19

- **ref as prop** -- `forwardRef` deprecated. Accept `ref?: React.Ref<HTMLElement>` as regular prop
- **useActionState** -- replaces `useFormState`: `const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(action, initialState)`
- **use()** -- unwrap Promise or Context during render (not in callbacks/effects). Enables conditional context reads
- **useOptimistic** -- `const [optimistic, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(state, mergeFn)` for instant UI feedback
- **useFormStatus** -- `const { pending } = useFormStatus()` in child of `<form action={...}>`
- **Server Components** -- default in App Router. Async, access DB/secrets directly. No hooks, no event handlers
- **Server Actions** -- `'use server'` directive. Validate inputs (Zod), `revalidateTag`/`revalidatePath` after mutations. **Server Actions are public endpoints** -- always verify auth/authz inside each action, not just in middleware or layout guards
- **`<Activity mode='visible'|'hidden'>`** -- preserves state/DOM for toggled components (experimental)

## Next.js App Router

**File conventions:** `page.tsx` (route UI), `layout.tsx` (shared wrapper), `template.tsx` (re-mounted on navigation, unlike layout), `loading.tsx` (Suspense), `error.tsx` (error boundary), `not-found.tsx` (404), `default.tsx` (parallel route fallback), `route.ts` (API endpoint)

**Rendering modes:** Server Components (default) | Client (`'use client'`) | Static (build) | Dynamic (request) | Streaming (progressive)

**Decision:** Server Component unless it needs hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs. Split: server parent + client child. Isolate interactive components as `'use client'` leaf components -- keep server components static with no global state or event handlers.

**Routing patterns:**
- Route groups `(name)` -- organize without affecting URL
- Parallel routes `@slot` -- independent loading states in same layout
- Intercepting routes `(.)` -- modal overlays with full-page fallback

**Caching:**
- `fetch(url, { cache: 'force-cache' })` -- static
- `fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })` -- ISR
- `fetch(url, { cache: 'no-store' })` -- dynamic
- Tag-based: `fetch(url, { next: { tags: ['products'] } })` then `revalidateTag('products')`

**Data fetching:** Fetch in Server Components where data is used. Use Suspense boundaries for slow queries. `React.cache()` for per-request dedup. `generateStaticParams` for static generation. `generateMetadata` for dynamic SEO. Static metadata with `title: { default: 'App', template: '%s | App' }` for cascading page titles. `after()` for non-blocking side effects (logging, analytics) -- runs after response is sent. Hoist static I/O (fonts, config) to module level -- runs once, not per request.

## Testing (Vitest + React Testing Library)

- **Component tests**: Vitest + RTL, co-located `*.test.tsx`. Default for React components.
- **Hook tests**: `renderHook` + `act`, co-located `*.test.ts`
- **Unit tests**: Vitest for pure functions, utilities, services
- **E2E**: Playwright for user flows and critical paths
- **Query priority**: `getByRole` > `getByLabelText` > `getByPlaceholderText` > `getByText` > `getByTestId`
- Mock API services and external providers; render child components real for integration confidence
- One behavior per test with AAA structure. Name: `should <behavior> when <condition>`
- Use `userEvent` over `fireEvent` for realistic interactions
- `findBy*` for async elements, `waitFor` after state-triggering actions
- `vi.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach`. Recreate state per test.
General testing discipline (anti-patterns, rationalization resistance): see [writing-tests](../writing-tests/SKILL.md) skill.

## Tailwind Integration

For Tailwind v4 configuration, utility patterns, dark mode, and component variants, see [tailwind-css](../tailwind-css/SKILL.md) skill.

**Class sorting in JSX**: when using `clsx`, `cva`, `cn`, `tv`, or `tw` utility functions, keep Tailwind classes in canonical order. Configure `eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss` with `useSortedClasses` and `functions: ["clsx", "cva", "cn", "tv", "tw"]` to enforce this automatically across JSX attributes and helper calls.

## Discipline

- Simplicity first -- every change as simple as possible, impact minimal code
- Only touch what's necessary -- avoid introducing unrelated changes
- No hacky workarounds -- if a fix feels wrong, step back and implement the clean solution
- Before adding a new abstraction, verify it appears in 3+ places

## References

- [testing.md](./references/testing.md) -- Component, hook, and mocking test examples
- [e2e-testing.md](./references/e2e-testing.md) -- Playwright E2E patterns

## Verify

- TypeScript compiles with zero errors
- No suppressed lint rules (`eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`) in new code
- `useEffect` dependency arrays not manually overridden
- No `forwardRef` usage in React 19+ projects (use `ref` prop directly)
