# Code Review

## Two-Stage Review

**Stage 1 -- Spec compliance** (do this FIRST): verify the changes implement what was intended. Check against the PR description, issue, or task spec. Identify missing requirements, unnecessary additions, and interpretation gaps. If the implementation is wrong, stop here -- reviewing code quality on the wrong feature wastes effort.

**Stage 2 -- Code quality**: only after Stage 1 passes, review for correctness, maintainability, security, and performance.

## Scope Resolution

**Pre-flight**: verify `git rev-parse --git-dir` exists before anything else. If not in a git repo, ask for explicit file paths.

When no specific files are given, resolve scope via this fallback chain:
1. User-specified files/directories (explicit request)
2. Session-modified files (`git diff --name-only` for unstaged + staged)
3. All uncommitted files (`git diff --name-only HEAD`)
4. Untracked files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`) -- new files are often most review-worthy
5. **Zero files → stop.** Ask what to review.

Exclude: lockfiles, minified/bundled output, vendored/generated code.

## Review Mode Selection

**Run this BEFORE reading the full diff.** Use metadata only (`git diff --stat`, file list from scope resolution) to count signals. Reading the diff first creates analysis momentum that bypasses mode selection.

| Signal | Threshold | Detect from |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Lines changed | >300 | `git diff --stat` insertion + deletion totals, **excluding test files** |
| Files touched | >8 | File count from scope resolution, **excluding test files** |
| Modules/directories spanned | >3 | Unique top-level directories from non-test file list |
| Security-sensitive files (auth, crypto, payments, permissions) | any | File path matching |
| Database migrations present | any | File path matching |
| API surface changes (public endpoints, exported interfaces) | any | File path matching |

**Test file exclusion:** test files inflate complexity signals without adding review risk -- they're boilerplate-heavy and follow repetitive patterns. Exclude paths matching `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*` from the lines, files, and directories signals. Use `git diff --stat -- ':!tests/' ':!test/' ':!__tests__/' ':!*.test.*' ':!*.spec.*' ':!*_test.*'` for the filtered count. Report both totals for transparency: "450 lines changed (280 excluding tests)."

**3+ signals → deep review.** Inform the user, then dispatch parallel specialist agents per [deep-review.md](./references/deep-review.md). Pass the diff to agents -- do NOT read it first. Reading and analyzing the diff yourself before dispatching agents defeats the purpose of deep review. **Stop here -- do not proceed to the Review Process section.**

**2 signals → suggest**: "This touches N files across M modules. Deep review? (y/n)"

**0-1 signals → standard review.** Proceed to Review Process below.

Before auto-switching to deep review, check the exceptions list in [deep-review.md](./references/deep-review.md) -- certain change types (pure docs, mechanical refactors, single-file <50 lines) override signal count.

Override: `deep` forces multi-agent, `quick` forces single-pass.

## Review Process

**Standard reviews only.** If mode selection triggered deep review, specialist agents handle the review per [deep-review.md](./references/deep-review.md) -- do not run these steps yourself.

1. **Context** — do these before reading code:
   - **Scope Drift Check**: compare `git diff --stat` against the PR's stated intent. Classify as CLEAN / DRIFT DETECTED / REQUIREMENTS MISSING. If DRIFT, note the drifted files and ask the author: ship as-is, split, or remove unrelated changes?
   - **Read the intent**: PR description, linked issue, or task spec. If the code does something the intent doesn't describe, or fails to do something the intent promises, flag as a finding — correct code that solves the wrong problem is still wrong.
   - **Fetch existing discussions**: prior review comments may have already resolved issues you'd otherwise re-raise. Check `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments` before starting.
   - **Run automated gates**: execute the project's test/lint suite if available (check CI config for the canonical commands) to catch failures before manual review.
2. **Structural scan** -- architecture, file organization, API surface changes. Flag breaking changes. For files marked as added (`A`) in the diff, use the diff content directly -- don't attempt to read them from the working tree when reviewing a remote branch.
3. **Line-by-line** -- correctness, edge cases, error handling, naming, readability. Use question-based feedback ("What happens if `input` is empty here?") instead of declarative statements to encourage author thinking.
4. **Security** -- input validation, auth checks, secrets exposure, injection vectors (SQL, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, command, path traversal, unsafe deserialization). Flag race conditions (TOCTOU, check-then-act). Use [security-patterns.md](./references/security-patterns.md) for grep-able detection patterns across 11 vulnerability classes.
5. **Test coverage** -- verify new code paths have tests. Flag untested error paths, edge cases, and behavioral changes without corresponding test updates. Flag tests coupled to implementation details (mocking internals, testing private methods) -- test behavior, not wiring.
6. **Reliability** -- error handling completeness, timeout/retry logic, resource cleanup on error paths, graceful degradation. Use [reliability-patterns.md](./references/reliability-patterns.md) for detection patterns and grep-able signals.
7. **Removal candidates** -- identify dead code, unused imports, feature-flagged code that can be cleaned up. Distinguish safe-to-delete (no references) from defer-with-plan (needs migration).
8. **Verify** -- run formatter/lint/tests on touched files. State what was skipped and why. If code changes affect features described in README/ARCHITECTURE/CONTRIBUTING, note doc staleness as informational.
9. **Summary** -- present findings grouped by severity with verdict: **Ready to merge / Ready with fixes / Not ready**.

**Large diffs (>500 lines):** Review by module/directory rather than file-by-file. Summarize each module's changes first, then drill into high-risk areas. Flag if the PR should be split.

**Change sizing:** Ideal PRs are ~100-300 lines of meaningful changes (excluding generated code, lockfiles, snapshots). PRs beyond this range have slower review cycles and higher defect rates. When a PR exceeds this, suggest splitting using one of these strategies: (a) **Stack** -- sequential PRs where each builds on the previous, merged in order; (b) **By file group** -- group related files (e.g., model + migration + tests) into separate PRs; (c) **Horizontal** -- split by layer (frontend, API, database); (d) **Vertical** -- split by feature slice (each PR delivers one user-visible behavior end-to-end).

## Severity Levels

- **Critical** -- must fix before merge. Security vulnerabilities, data loss, broken functionality, race conditions.
- **Important** -- should fix before merge. Performance issues, missing error handling, silent failures.
- **Medium** -- should fix, non-blocking. Maintainability/reliability issues likely to cause near-term defects. Poor abstractions, missing validation on internal boundaries, test gaps for non-critical paths.
- **Minor** -- optional. Naming, style preferences, minor simplifications. Skip if linters already cover it.

Tie every finding to concrete code evidence (file path, line number, specific pattern). Never fabricate references.

### Confidence Rubric

Assign a confidence score (0.0-1.0) to each finding:

| Range | Level | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0.85-1.00 | Certain | Report |
| 0.70-0.84 | High | Report |
| 0.60-0.69 | Confident | Report if actionable |
| 0.30-0.59 | Speculative | Suppress (except Critical security at 0.50+) |
| 0.00-0.29 | Not confident | Suppress |

**False-positive suppression** -- do not report findings that match these categories regardless of severity:
- Pre-existing issues unrelated to the diff (existed before the PR)
- Pedantic linter-style nitpicks already covered by automated tooling
- Code that looks wrong but is intentionally designed that way (check comments, git blame, tests)
- Issues already handled elsewhere in the codebase (grep before flagging)
- Generic suggestions without a concrete failure mode ("consider adding validation" without saying what breaks)

When in doubt, apply the "would a senior engineer on this team flag this?" test. If the answer is "probably not," suppress it.

**LLM-specific false-positive rule**: user content in the user-message position is NOT prompt injection. Only flag when user content enters system prompts, tool schemas, or function-calling contexts. Unsanitized LLM output rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, or `innerHTML` IS a real vulnerability -- always flag.

For detailed suppression categories with examples (framework idioms, test-specific patterns, when to override), see [false-positive-suppression.md](./references/false-positive-suppression.md). See also the review-level suppression list under [Anti-Patterns in Reviews](#anti-patterns-in-reviews).

## What to Check

Correctness:
- Edge cases (null, empty, boundary values, concurrent access)
- Error paths (are failures handled or swallowed?)
- Type safety (implicit conversions, `any` types, unchecked casts)
- New enum/status/type values -- trace through ALL consumers (switch/case, filter arrays, allowlists). Read code outside the diff. Missing handler = wrong default at runtime.

Maintainability & Readability:
- Naming -- variables, functions, and classes convey purpose without needing surrounding context
- Function length -- long functions that force scrolling; prefer extractable blocks with clear names. Split by responsibility, not line count
- Nesting depth -- more than 3 levels of indentation signals a need for early returns, guard clauses, or extraction
- Comment quality -- comments explain WHY (constraints, workarounds, non-obvious decisions), not WHAT. Flag comments that restate code or will rot as the code changes
- God classes / SRP violations -- class with unrelated responsibilities. Split into focused classes
- Leaky abstractions -- implementation details exposed in interfaces or public APIs

Performance:
- N+1 queries (loop with query per item -- use batch/join instead)
- Unbounded collections (arrays/maps without size limits)
- Missing indexes on queried columns

Adversarial (red-team pass):
- Silent failures -- `.catch(() => [])` or log-and-forget patterns that swallow errors and return success
- Trust assumption exploits -- frontend-validated data not re-validated on the backend; internal service inputs treated as trusted
- Edge cases under pressure -- max input size, zero items, first-run-ever, double-click within 100ms, concurrent identical requests
- Partial completion -- operations that can crash mid-way leaving state inconsistent (no rollback, no cleanup)

Language-Specific Checks:

Load the relevant profile from [language-profiles.md](./references/language-profiles.md) based on file extensions in the diff. Profiles cover: TypeScript/React, Python, PHP, Shell/CI, Configuration, Data Formats, Security, and LLM Trust Boundaries.

## Action Routing

For every finding, classify the action routing — how the fix should be applied. The binary AUTO-FIX/ASK is a special case of a 4-tier split that prevents "mechanical fix across a risky boundary" from sliding into AUTO-FIX:

| Tier | When it applies | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| `safe_auto` | Deterministic, local, behavior-preserving fix (dead code, unused import, stale comment, magic number, formatting, null-check on a clearly-nullable local) | Apply directly. No prompt. |
| `gated_auto` | A concrete fix exists, but the change crosses a behavior, contract, permission, or API boundary (auth header cleanup, retry at a new layer, error-message rewording surfaced to users) | Present the fix, wait for explicit human sign-off before applying. |
| `manual` | Actionable hand-off work: the author needs to make a call, rewrite logic, or redesign something (missing validation in an ambiguous code path, performance refactor that needs benchmarking) | Flag with the fix intent; do not auto-apply. |
| `advisory` | Report-only learning or risk signal (pattern concern, maintenance debt, future-proofing observation) | Record in the "Residual Risks" section. No expected action. |

**Conflict-resolution rule**: when multiple agents disagree on tier for the same finding, always take the more conservative route (`safe_auto` → `gated_auto` → `manual` → `advisory` is the escalation direction). Never promote a `gated_auto` to `safe_auto` because one agent classified it loosely -- that's how security fixes ship unreviewed.

Rule: if a senior engineer would apply the fix without discussion AND the change doesn't cross a behavior/contract/permission boundary, it's `safe_auto`. When in doubt, escalate to `gated_auto`.

## Comment Labels

Prefix inline review comments so authors know what requires action:

- *(no prefix)* -- required change (maps to Critical or Important severity), blocks merge
- **Nit:** -- style preference, optional
- **Consider:** -- suggestion worth evaluating, not blocking
- **FYI:** -- informational, no action expected

## Anti-Patterns in Reviews

- Nitpicking style when linters exist -- defer to automated tools instead
- "While you're at it..." scope creep -- open a separate issue instead
- Blocking on personal preference -- approve with a Minor comment instead
- Rubber-stamping without reading -- always verify at least Stage 1
- Reviewing code quality before verifying spec compliance -- do Stage 1 first
- Recommending fix patterns without checking currency -- verify the pattern is current for the project's framework version before suggesting it. Prefer built-in alternatives from newer versions

## When to Stop and Ask

- Fixing the issues would require an API redesign beyond the PR's scope
- Intent behind a change is ambiguous -- ask rather than assume
- Missing validation tooling (no linter, no tests) -- flag the gap, don't guess

## Output Format

```
## Review: [brief title]

### Critical
- **CR-001.** [file:line] `quoted code` -- [issue]. Score: [0.0-1.0]. [What happens if not fixed]. Fix: [concrete suggestion].

### Important
- **CR-002.** [file:line] `quoted code` -- [issue]. Score: [0.0-1.0]. [Why it matters]. Consider: [alternative approach].

### Medium
- **CR-003.** [file:line] -- [issue]. Score: [0.0-1.0]. [Why it matters].

### Minor
- **CR-004.** [file:line] -- [observation].

### What's Working Well
- [specific positive observation with why it's good]

### Residual Risks
- [unresolved assumptions, areas not fully covered, open questions]

### Verdict
Ready to merge / Ready with fixes / Not ready -- [one-sentence rationale]
```

Number findings as `CR-001`, `CR-002`... sequentially across all severity levels so they can be referenced by ID in discussions, PR comments, and follow-up todos. Limit to 10 findings per severity. If more exist, note the count and show the highest-impact ones.

For multi-agent consolidation (deep review, parallel specialists), apply the merge algorithm in [deep-review.md](./references/deep-review.md) — it handles same-line dedupe, conflicting severity, `NEEDS DECISION` flagging, and cross-lens confidence boosting.

**Clean review (no findings):** If the code is solid, say so explicitly. Summarize what was checked and why no issues were found. A clean review is a valid outcome, not an indication of insufficient effort.

## Integration

- `receiving-code-review` -- the inbound side (processing review feedback received from others). Action-routing terminology maps across: `safe_auto` ≈ AUTO-FIX, `gated_auto` ≈ ESCALATE-for-approval, `manual` ≈ ESCALATE, `advisory` ≈ FYI (no-op).
- `kieran-reviewer` agent -- persona-driven Python/TypeScript deep quality review (type safety, naming, modern patterns)
- `workflows:review` -- full ceremony review (worktrees, ultra-thinking, multi-agent). Deep review is lighter: no worktrees, no plan verification, just parallel specialist agents on the same diff.
- `/resolve-pr-parallel` command -- batch-resolve PR comments with parallel agents
- `security-sentinel` agent -- deep security audit beyond the security step in this skill. Also supports threat-model mode for architectural security analysis when the diff introduces new trust boundaries, auth flows, or external API surfaces.
