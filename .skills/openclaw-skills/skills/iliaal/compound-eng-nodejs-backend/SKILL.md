# Node.js Backend

**Verify before implementing**: For framework-specific APIs (Express 5, Fastify 5, Node.js 22+ built-ins), search current docs via `search_docs` before writing code. Training data may lag current releases.

## Framework Selection

| Context | Choose | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Edge/Serverless | Hono | Zero-dep, fastest cold starts |
| Performance API | Fastify | 2-3x faster than Express, built-in schema validation |
| Enterprise/team | NestJS | DI, decorators, structured conventions |
| Legacy/ecosystem | Express | Most middleware, widest adoption |

Ask user: deployment target, cold start needs, team experience, existing codebase.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── routes/          # HTTP: parse request, call service, format response
├── middleware/       # Auth, validation, rate limiting, logging
├── services/        # Business logic (no HTTP types)
├── repositories/    # Data access only (queries, ORM)
├── config/          # Env, DB pool, constants
└── types/           # Shared TypeScript interfaces
```

- Routes never contain business logic
- Services never import Request/Response
- Repositories never throw HTTP errors
- Dependencies point inward only (Clean Architecture rule): routes -> services -> repositories. Never the reverse.
- For scripts/prototypes: single file is fine -- ask "will this grow?"

## TypeScript Rules

- Use `import type { }` for type-only imports -- eliminates runtime overhead
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes (2-5x faster type resolution than intersections)
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` -- forces explicit narrowing
- Use `z.infer<typeof Schema>` as single source of truth -- never duplicate types and schemas
- Minimize `as` assertions -- use type guards instead
- Add explicit return types to exported functions (faster declaration emit)
- Untyped package? `declare module 'pkg' { const v: unknown; export default v; }` in `types/ambient.d.ts`

## Validation

**Zod** (TypeScript inference) or **TypeBox** (Fastify native). Validate at boundaries only: request entry, before DB ops, env vars at startup. Use `.extend()`, `.pick()`, `.omit()`, `.partial()`, `.merge()` for DRY schemas.

## Error Handling

Custom error hierarchy: `AppError(message, statusCode, isOperational)` → `ValidationError(400)`, `NotFoundError(404)`, `UnauthorizedError(401)`, `ForbiddenError(403)`, `ConflictError(409)`

Centralized handler middleware:
- `AppError` → return `{ error: message }` with statusCode
- Unknown → log full stack, return 500 + generic message in production
- Async wrapper: `const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) => Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);`

Codes: 400 bad input | 401 no auth | 403 no permission | 404 missing | 409 conflict | 422 business rule | 429 rate limited | 500 server fault

## API Design

**Contract-first**: define route schemas (Zod schemas, Fastify JSON Schema, or OpenAPI spec) before writing handler logic. The schema is the contract -- implementation follows. Generate OpenAPI/Swagger docs from these schemas for interactive API documentation.

- **Hyrum's Law awareness**: every observable response field, ordering, or timing becomes a dependency for callers. Use Zod schemas or Fastify response schemas to control exactly what's serialized -- never return raw ORM objects or untyped objects from handlers.
- **Addition over modification**: add new optional fields rather than changing or removing existing ones. Removing a field from a response schema breaks callers silently. Deprecate first (mark in OpenAPI spec), remove in a later version.
- **Consistent error envelope**: all errors -- validation, auth, not-found, application -- must produce the same `{ error: { code, message, details? } }` structure. Centralize in the error handler middleware. Callers build error handling once; inconsistent errors force per-endpoint special cases.
- **Boundary validation**: validate at the middleware/route handler level (Zod `.parse()` on request body/params, Fastify schema validation). Services and repositories trust that input was validated at entry -- no redundant checks scattered through business logic.
- **Third-party responses are untrusted data**: validate shape and content of external API responses before using them in logic, rendering, or decision-making. A compromised or misbehaving service can return unexpected types, malicious content, or missing fields. Parse through a Zod schema before use.
- **Resources**: plural nouns (`/users`), max 2 nesting levels (`/users/:id/orders`)
- **Methods**: GET read | POST create | PUT replace | PATCH partial | DELETE remove
- **Versioning**: URL path `/api/v1/`
- **Response**: `{ data, pagination?: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }`
- **Queries**: `?page=1&limit=20&status=active&sort=createdAt,desc`
- Return `Location` header on 201. Use 204 for successful DELETE with no body.

## Async Patterns

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `async/await` | Sequential operations |
| `Promise.all` | Parallel independent ops |
| `Promise.allSettled` | Parallel, some may fail |
| `Promise.race` | Timeout or first-wins |

Never use readFileSync or other sync methods in production -- use `fs.promises` or stream equivalents. Offload CPU work to worker threads (Piscina). Stream large payloads.

## Production Resilience

- **Fail-fast env validation**: parse and validate all environment variables at startup with a Zod schema (`const env = envSchema.parse(process.env)`). If invalid, crash before serving traffic. Never discover a missing env var on the first request that needs it.
- **Health endpoints**: expose both `/health` (shallow, always 200 if process is alive) and `/ready` (deep, verifies database, cache, and critical dependencies are reachable). Load balancers probe `/ready` for traffic routing; monitoring probes `/health` for process liveness. Don't conflate them.
- **Caching**: Redis cache-aside for DB/API responses; in-memory LRU with TTL for hot paths. Always invalidate on writes.
- **Load shedding**: `@fastify/under-pressure` (or equivalent) -- monitor event loop delay, heap, RSS; return 503 when thresholds exceeded.
- **Response schemas**: In Fastify, always define response schemas -- enables `fast-json-stringify` for 2-3x faster serialization.
- **Circuit breaker**: use `opossum` for outbound service calls. States: CLOSED (normal) -> OPEN (failing, return fallback) -> HALF_OPEN (probe). Prevents cascade failures when downstream services are down.

## Discipline

- Simplicity first -- every change as simple as possible, impact minimal code
- Only touch what's necessary -- avoid introducing unrelated changes
- No hacky workarounds -- if a fix feels wrong, step back and implement the clean solution
- Before adding a new abstraction, verify it appears in 3+ places. If not, inline it.
- If a fix requires bypassing TypeScript (`as any`, non-null assertions on untrusted data, `// @ts-ignore`), treat it as a design smell and find the typed solution
- Verify: `tsc --noEmit && npm test` pass with zero warnings before declaring done

## Verify

- `tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- `npm test` passes with zero failures
- No TypeScript bypasses (`as any`, `@ts-ignore`) in new code
