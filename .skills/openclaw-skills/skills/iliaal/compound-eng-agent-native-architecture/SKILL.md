# Agent-Native Architecture

## Core Principles

Five principles govern agent-native design. For detailed explanations, examples, and test criteria, see [core-principles.md](./references/core-principles.md).

| Principle | One-line test |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Parity** | Can the agent achieve every outcome the UI allows? |
| **Granularity** | To change behavior, do you edit prose or refactor code? |
| **Composability** | Can you add a feature by writing a new prompt, without new code? |
| **Emergent Capability** | Can the agent handle open-ended requests you didn't design for? |
| **Improvement Over Time** | Does the app work better after a month, even without code changes? |

## Focus Area Selection

1. **Design architecture** - Plan a new agent-native system from scratch
2. **Files & workspace** - Use files as the universal interface, shared workspace patterns
3. **Tool design** - Build primitive tools, dynamic capability discovery, CRUD completeness
4. **Domain tools** - Know when to add domain tools vs stay with primitives
5. **Execution patterns** - Completion signals, partial completion, context limits
6. **System prompts** - Define agent behavior in prompts, judgment criteria
7. **Context injection** - Inject runtime app state into agent prompts
8. **Action parity** - Ensure agents can do everything users can do
9. **Self-modification** - Enable agents to safely evolve themselves
10. **Product design** - Progressive disclosure, latent demand, approval patterns
11. **Mobile patterns** - iOS storage, background execution, checkpoint/resume
12. **Testing** - Test agent-native apps for capability and parity
13. **Refactoring** - Make existing code more agent-native
14. **Anti-patterns** - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
15. **Success criteria** - Verify your architecture is agent-native
16. **Hooks patterns** - Hook events, decision control, MCP matchers, async hooks

**Wait for response before proceeding.**

## Architecture Review Checklist

When designing an agent-native system, verify these **before implementation**:

### Core Principles
- [ ] **Parity:** Every UI action has a corresponding agent capability
- [ ] **Granularity:** Tools are primitives; features are prompt-defined outcomes
- [ ] **Composability:** New features can be added via prompts alone
- [ ] **Emergent Capability:** Agent can handle open-ended requests in your domain

### Tool Design
- [ ] **Dynamic vs Static:** For external APIs where agent should have full access, use Dynamic Capability Discovery
- [ ] **CRUD Completeness:** Every entity has create, read, update, AND delete
- [ ] **Primitives over Workflows:** Tools expose atomic capabilities; compose workflows in prompts
- [ ] **API as Validator:** Use `z.string()` inputs when the API validates, not `z.enum()`
- [ ] **Eval Gate:** 10 Q/A pairs in CI (read-only, multi-hop, closed-data), 9/10 pass threshold. See [mcp-tool-design.md](./references/mcp-tool-design.md) Evaluation section.

### Files & Workspace
- [ ] **Shared Workspace:** Agent and user work in same data space
- [ ] **context.md Pattern:** Agent reads/updates context file for accumulated knowledge
- [ ] **File Organization:** Entity-scoped directories with consistent naming
- [ ] **Context Durability:** Incremental progress writes (WAL pattern) so interrupted tasks resume from last checkpoint

### Agent Execution
- [ ] **Completion Signals:** Agent has explicit `complete_task` tool (not heuristic detection)
- [ ] **Partial Completion:** Multi-step tasks track progress for resume
- [ ] **Context Limits:** Designed for bounded context from the start
- [ ] **Validate-Before-Run:** Agent previews planned actions before executing destructive operations

### Context Injection
- [ ] **Available Resources:** System prompt includes what exists (files, data, types)
- [ ] **Available Capabilities:** System prompt documents tools with user vocabulary
- [ ] **Dynamic Context:** Context refreshes for long sessions (or provide `refresh_context` tool)
- [ ] **Trust levels for loaded content:** System prompt distinguishes trusted (developer-authored) from untrusted (user input, retrieved docs, tool outputs); untrusted text is data, never instructions. See [dynamic-context-injection.md](./references/dynamic-context-injection.md) Trust Levels section for the prompt-injection defense details.

### UI Integration
- [ ] **Agent -> UI:** Agent changes reflect in UI (shared service, file watching, or event bus)
- [ ] **No Silent Actions:** Agent writes trigger UI updates immediately
- [ ] **Capability Discovery:** Users can learn what agent can do

### Governance
- [ ] **Approval Gates:** Destructive or irreversible actions require user confirmation
- [ ] **Audit Trail:** Agent actions logged with timestamp, tool, and outcome
- [ ] **Scope Boundaries:** Agent cannot access resources outside its designated workspace

### Hooks & Governance Automation
- [ ] **Event Coverage:** Only 6 hook events fire in agent context (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PermissionRequest, PostToolUseFailure, Stop/SubagentStop); session lifecycle logic lives in the orchestrator
- [ ] **Decision Gates:** PreToolUse hooks enforce tool-level policy (allow/deny/ask/defer) instead of hardcoded checks
- [ ] **Completion Gating:** SubagentStop hooks block premature completion when verification steps remain
- [ ] **MCP Matchers:** Regex patterns target tools by server and operation for capability-based security
- [ ] **Two-Tier Config:** Shared policy committed, personal overrides git-ignored, per-hook disable toggles

### Mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] **Checkpoint/Resume:** Handle iOS app suspension gracefully
- [ ] **iCloud Storage:** iCloud-first with local fallback for multi-device sync
- [ ] **Cost Awareness:** Model tier selection (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)

**When designing architecture, explicitly address each checkbox in your plan.**
