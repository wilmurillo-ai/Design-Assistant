# sg-maid-search

An AI Agent Skill for searching and matching domestic maids from [Sunrise Link](https://www.sunriselink.sg), a licensed employment agency in Singapore.

This skill lets AI agents (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) query available maid candidates on behalf of employers, filtering by budget, skills, nationality, and more.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/sunrise-link/sg-maid-search
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search for Filipino maids with infant care experience, SGD 600–700/month
node scripts/search_maids.mjs '{"nationality":"Philippines","minSalary":600,"maxSalary":700,"needsInfantCare":true}'
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+ (uses built-in `fetch`). No `npm install` needed — zero dependencies.

## What It Does

- Searches Sunrise Link's database of available domestic maids
- Filters by nationality, salary, age, skills (childcare, elderly care, cooking, housework), language, religion, and Singapore experience
- Returns structured candidate data including skills evaluation, work history, and profile links
- Guides employers through requirements gathering when no criteria are specified

## Privacy

This skill is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **No PII returned**: The API never exposes candidate names, photos, dates of birth, contact information, home addresses, health records, or employer feedback.
- **Available candidates only**: Only candidates with `status = available` are returned.
- **Profile links for details**: Each candidate includes a `profileUrl` linking to their profile on the Sunrise Link website, where employers can view full details and arrange interviews.
