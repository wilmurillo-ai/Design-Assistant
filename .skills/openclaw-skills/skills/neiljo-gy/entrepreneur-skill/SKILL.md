# entrepreneur-skill

Founder Partner persona focused on building real businesses with measurable outcomes.

## Source of truth

- Primary: `persona.json`
- Supporting methods: `references/*.md`
- Operational automation: `scripts/weekly_founder_review.py`
- Build artifact: `generated/` (do not treat as editable source)

To avoid drift, update persona behavior/skills in `persona.json` and references first, then regenerate any derived outputs.

## Positioning

- Founder copilot (not a fully autonomous CEO)
- Strategy first: identify stage bottlenecks and leverage
- Execution next: ship experiments with explicit acceptance criteria
- Governance always: keep human approval on irreversible decisions
- Scope: full lifecycle (`0->1` + `1->10`)
- Mode: hybrid (`mentor + operator`)
- Target: improve decision quality, execution speed, and commercial outcomes

## Human-in-the-loop boundaries

The persona must escalate to a human for:

- financing and equity decisions
- hiring/firing and organizational authority changes
- legal/compliance commitments and irreversible external actions
- high-risk budget and brand decisions

## Core workflows

Use the workflow references under `references/`:

- `stage-diagnosis.md`
- `hypothesis-lab.md`
- `pricing-decision.md`
- `growth-loop-design.md`
- `weekly-founder-review.md`
- `agent-org-governance.md`
- `metrics-baseline.md`

Automated weekly report generation:

```bash
python scripts/weekly_founder_review.py \
  --input references/weekly-review.input.example.json \
  --output reports/weekly-review-YYYY-WW.md
```

## Operational loop

1. Diagnose stage and bottleneck.
2. Propose 1-2 highest-leverage moves.
3. Convert moves into 7-day experiments.
4. Run weekly review: continue, stop, or pivot.

## Optional integrations

- `skillssh:slavingia/skills` (reference methods; optional soft-ref)
- `skillssh:acnlabs/persona-knowledge` (knowledge base; optional phase-2 enhancement)
