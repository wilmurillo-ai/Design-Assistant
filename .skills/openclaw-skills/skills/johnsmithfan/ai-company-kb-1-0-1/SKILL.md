# AI Company Knowledge Base v1.0.1

> Shared knowledge base (enhanced). Cross-Agent knowledge sharing, state sync, IMA real-time sync hub, standardized Handoff protocol.

---

## Trigger Scenarios

Invoke when Agent needs to:
- Save/read audit logs, query history
- Update/read shared state, sync with other agents
- Access strategy docs, financial records, compliance reports
- Initiate/complete task handoff

## Interfaces

### write_shared_state(domain, data, agent_id, sync_ima=True)
Write shared state file (optional auto-sync to IMA).
domain: cashflow | reputation | quality-metrics | risk-level | operations | security

### read_shared_state(domain) -> dict
Read single shared state.

### write_audit_log(category, agent_id, action, detail, sensitive=False)
Write audit log entry.
category: ceo-decisions | financial | legal | hr | tech | quality

### write_handoff(handoff_type, sender, receiver, task_summary, completed, pending, key_data=None, risks=None, attachments=None) -> str
Write standard handoff document.
handoff_type: pending | in-progress | completed

## Iron Rules

```
X  Sensitive financial/legal data must be marked [sensitive]
X  Every Agent call must write corresponding audit log
X  After shared-state update, notify relevant reading agents (sessions_send)
X  Audit logs are permanent, never delete
X  Handoff documents must be created within 10 minutes of task completion
X  On IMA sync failure, roll back to local write and log error
```
