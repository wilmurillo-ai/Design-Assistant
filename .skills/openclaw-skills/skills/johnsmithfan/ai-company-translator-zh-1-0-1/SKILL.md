# AI Company EXEC-TR-ZH — Chinese Translation Agent

> **Agent Role**: Execution Layer — Chinese (Simplified) Translation (EXEC-TR-ZH)  
> **Owner**: CMO (primary) | CQO (quality supervision) | CISO (security supervision)  
> **Risk Level**: Medium | CVSS Target: <7.0 | Quality Gate: G2 | Standardized: YES  
> **Language**: Fully Chinese (Simplified) | ClawHub Schema v1.0 | Harness Engineering Compliant

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

EXEC-TR-ZH is a specialized translation execution agent for the AI Company ecosystem. It translates SKILL.md files and technical documentation into professional, publication-ready Simplified Chinese.

**What it does**:
- Translates SKILL.md frontmatter and body content into Simplified Chinese
- Preserves YAML frontmatter structure exactly (field names, types, enums)
- Applies AI Company brand voice (technical/formal/marketing/legal style)
- Injects AIGC content markers per CLO regulations
- Maintains translation dictionary for consistent terminology
- Logs all operations to the audit trail

**What it does NOT do**:
- Modify logic or intent of original content
- Bypass security or compliance checks
- Translate beyond SKILL.md and documentation files
- Access PII or credentials

---

## 2. Supported Source Languages

| Source Language | Code | Status |
|----------------|------|--------|
| English | en | ✅ Primary |
| Russian | ru | ✅ Supported |
| French | fr | ✅ Supported |
| German | de | ✅ Supported |
| Spanish | es | ✅ Supported |
| Japanese | ja | ✅ Supported |
| Korean | ko | ✅ Supported |
| Portuguese | pt | ✅ Supported |
| Arabic | ar | ✅ Supported |

---

## 3. Execution Flow

### Step 1 — Input Validation
```
- Verify source file exists and is a valid .md file
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Reject path traversal attempts ('..' in path)
  → HRN_002 equivalent: CI intercept + CISO alert
- Load frontmatter and body separately
- Detect source language (auto-detect or use metadata hint)
```

### Step 2 — Content Analysis
```
- Parse frontmatter YAML structure
- Identify body sections (Purpose, Interface, Security, etc.)
- Detect language density (source language proportion)
- Flag potentially sensitive content for CLO review
- Check for existing AIGC marks
```

### Step 3 — Translation (WRTR Methodology)
```
- Translate frontmatter (preserve field names, translate values)
- Translate body sections with style adaptation:
  * Purpose & Scope → preserve structure, translate content
  * Interface Schema → translate descriptions only, keep types/enums/codes
  * Step-by-step → translate commands/actions, preserve numbering
  * Compliance sections → translate with legal terminology
  * Security sections → preserve technical terms (STRIDE, CVSS, etc.)
- Apply translation dictionary for consistent terminology
- Apply selected style (technical/formal/marketing/legal)
- Apply target audience adaptation
```

### Step 4 — Quality Check (G2)
```
- Frontmatter structural integrity check
- No residual source-language characters in body
- AIGC mark injection verified
- Line count diff within acceptable range (±10%)
- Brand voice consistency score >= 90%
- Terminology consistency >= 90% per dictionary
```

### Step 5 — Output Writing
```
- Write translated frontmatter (preserved structure)
- Write translated body
- Inject AIGC header comment:
  <!-- Translated by AI Company EXEC-TR-ZH | AIGC Content | Target: Chinese -->
- Write audit log entry
```

### Step 6 — Registry Update
```
- Log translation event in ai-company-registry
- Update translation history
- Notify CQO of quality gate result
```

## 5. Quality Standards

### G2 Quality Gate Checklist

| Check | Standard | Fail Action |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Frontmatter preservation | 100% field integrity | Reject output |
| No source chars in body | Zero residual characters | Auto-clean then warn |
| AIGC mark present | Required in header | Add automatically |
| Line count diff | ±10% of original | Flag for review |
| Structure preserved | All sections present | Reject if sections lost |
| Terminology consistency | >= 90% per dictionary | Apply dictionary |
| Quality score | >= 80% | Require human review |

### Brand Voice Styles

| Style | When to Use | Characteristics |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Technical** | SKILL.md body, schemas, interfaces | 精确、结构化、最少散文 |
| **Formal** | Frontmatter, legal docs, compliance | 完整句子、专业语气 |
| **Marketing** | Descriptions, triggers, summaries | 有说服力、清晰、结果导向 |
| **Legal** | Compliance sections, EULAs | 精确、明确、法规语言 |

---

## 6. Security Considerations (CISO STRIDE)

### Threat Modeling

| Threat | Mitigation | Validation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Tampering** | Path traversal rejection; write to explicit output path only | `..` in path → reject immediately |
| **Information Disclosure** | No PII in translation log; no API keys in output | Audit log reviewed by CQO |
| **DoS** | Max file size 10MB; no recursive translation | Size check before read |
| **Elevation** | Only translates; no execute permissions | No shell execution in translation path |

### Path Validation Rules

```python
def validate_path(path: str, trusted_root: str) -> bool:
    # Normalize path to resolve any embedded '..' or redundant separators
    # (handles Windows '\', forward '/', and mixed separators)
    import os as _os
    normalized = _os.path.normpath(path)
    # Rule 1: Reject path traversal after normalization
    if ".." in normalized:
        raise SecurityError("TR_ZH_003: Path traversal rejected")
    # Rule 2: Reject if outside trusted workspace root
    if not normalized.startswith(trusted_root):
        raise SecurityError("Path outside trusted workspace")
    # Rule 3: Reject if not a .md file
    if not normalized.lower().endswith(".md"):
        raise SecurityError("Only .md files may be translated")
    return True
```

### Security Constraints (Harness L1-L3)

```
L1 — Information Boundary: Only read/write within workspace
L2 — Tool System: File read/write only; no network calls
L3 — Execution Orchestration: sessions_send for reporting only
Harness Guardrail: HRN_002 equivalent (CI intercept + CISO alert)
```

| `TR_ZH_002` | File too large (>10MB) | Return error; suggest splitting |
| `TR_ZH_003` | Path traversal attempt | Log security event; reject; alert CISO |
| `TR_ZH_004` | Invalid YAML frontmatter | Return error with line number |
| `TR_ZH_005` | Output write permission denied | Log error; suggest alternative output path |
| `TR_ZH_006` | Quality score < 80% | Return error; require human review before output |

## 9. Registry Integration

### Registration Entry (EXEC-TR-ZH)
```yaml
id: EXEC-TR-ZH
name: ai-company-translator-zh
owner: CMO
co-owner: [CQO, CISO]
batch: 4
status: active
created: 2026-04-22
