# Amazon Opportunity Discoverer — APIClaw Agent Skill

> Tell me your budget and experience. I find opportunities, score them, and rank.

## What This Skill Does

Automated product opportunity scanner tailored to your seller profile. Tell it your budget, experience level, and risk tolerance — it selects the right strategies from 14 preset modes, scans categories, validates candidates with real-time data, and ranks opportunities by a 7-dimension composite score (1-100). From beginner-friendly picks to advanced aggressive plays.

### What Makes This Different

- **Profile-driven strategy**: Auto-selects scanning modes based on your budget, experience, and risk tolerance
- **7-dimension scoring**: Demand, Competition Gap, Price Opportunity, Trend, Profit Margin, Differentiation, Profile Fit
- **Tiered results**: S-tier 🔥 (act fast), A-tier ✅ (pursue), B-tier ⚠️ (needs differentiation), C-tier ❌ (skip)
- **Smart category selection**: No category? Scans market data to find the best subcategories for you
- **Quick-Scan mode**: ~10 credits for directional results when you just need a quick look
