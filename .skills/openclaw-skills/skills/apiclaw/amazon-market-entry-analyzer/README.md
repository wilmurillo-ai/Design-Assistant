# Amazon Market Entry Analyzer — APIClaw Agent Skill

> One input. Complete market viability assessment with sub-market discovery. **GO / CAUTION / AVOID.**

## What This Skill Does

Evaluates whether a product category on Amazon is worth entering. Give it a keyword or category, and it:

1. **Discovers all sub-markets** within the category — finds every leaf-level niche and ranks them by opportunity
2. **Deep-dives top sub-markets** — pulls data from all 11 APIClaw endpoints for comprehensive analysis
3. **Scores market viability** (1-100) across 7 dimensions: market size, trend, competition, pricing, new entrant space, consumer pain points, and profit potential
4. **Delivers a verdict** — GO ✅ / CAUTION ⚠️ / AVOID 🔴 with confidence-tagged reasoning

### What Makes This Different

- **Sub-market discovery**: Don't just analyze "Fitness" — automatically find and compare 46+ leaf sub-markets (Protein Whey, Resistance Bands, Yoga Mats...) to pinpoint the best entry point
- **11 API endpoints**: Every data source cross-validated. Not just market metrics — includes competitor deep-dives, consumer pain points, price band analysis, brand landscape, and historical trends
- **Confidence tagging**: Every data point tagged as 📊 Data-backed, 🔍 Inferred, or 💡 Directional — you always know what's hard data vs. interpretation
