# Amazon Daily Market Radar — APIClaw Agent Skill

> Set it. Forget it. Get alerted when it matters.

## What This Skill Does

Automated daily monitoring and alert system for Amazon sellers. Tracks your ASINs and competitors, detects price changes, BSR movements, new entrants, review spikes, and stock-out signals. First run establishes a baseline; subsequent runs compare against it and fire tiered alerts. Designed for unattended agent automation.

### What Makes This Different

- **Set-and-forget**: First run = baseline, every run after = smart change detection
- **Three-tier alerts**: 🔴 RED (price crash, BSR collapse, 1-star spike), 🟡 YELLOW (new competitors, moderate shifts), 🟢 GREEN (opportunities like competitor stock-outs)
- **Signal validation**: Distinguishes sustained trends (📊 7+ days) from single-day spikes (💡)
- **Cron-ready**: Built for scheduled execution with auto-monitor setup
