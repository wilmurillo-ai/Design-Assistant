# Amazon Analysis — Full-Spectrum Research & Seller Intelligence

> 14 product selection strategies. One skill to rule them all.

## What This Skill Does

The Swiss Army knife of Amazon product research. Supports 14 built-in selection modes — from hot products and rising stars to long-tail niches and FBM-friendly picks. Combines market research, product selection, competitor analysis, ASIN evaluation, pricing reference, and category research into a single unified workflow.

### What Makes This Different

- **14 selection modes**: hot-products, rising-stars, underserved, high-demand-low-barrier, beginner, fast-movers, emerging, single-variant, long-tail, new-release, low-price, top-bsr, fbm-friendly, broad-catalog
- **Composite commands**: `report` and `opportunity` run multi-endpoint pipelines in one shot
- **Flexible filtering**: Modes stack with explicit filters (`--price-max`, `--sales-min`, etc.)
- **Confidence tagging**: Every data point tagged as 📊 Data-backed, 🔍 Inferred, or 💡 Directional
