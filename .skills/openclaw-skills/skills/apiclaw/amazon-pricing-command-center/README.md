# Amazon Pricing Command Center — APIClaw Agent Skill

> Give me your ASIN(s). RAISE, HOLD, or LOWER — backed by data.

## What This Skill Does

Data-driven pricing strategy engine for Amazon sellers. Just provide your ASIN(s) — the skill auto-detects each product's leaf category, analyzes the pricing landscape, and delivers clear RAISE/HOLD/LOWER signals with profit simulation. Supports single ASIN or batch analysis with auto-grouping by category.

### What Makes This Different

- **ASIN-only input**: No keyword needed — auto-detects leaf category from BSR data
- **Clear pricing signals**: RAISE / HOLD / LOWER with data-backed reasoning
- **Profit simulation**: 3 scenarios (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive) with full cost breakdown
- **Sales/Competition Ratio**: Identifies the best entry price band by demand-to-barrier ratio, not just highest sales
- **Batch mode**: Multiple ASINs auto-grouped by category to share market data and save credits
