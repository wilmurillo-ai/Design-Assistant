# Amazon Review Intelligence Extractor — APIClaw Agent Skill

> Deep consumer insights from 1B+ pre-analyzed Amazon reviews. No NLP required.

## What This Skill Does

Extracts actionable consumer insights from Amazon product reviews. Give it an ASIN or a category, and it analyzes reviews across **11 dimensions**:

| Dimension | What It Reveals |
|-----------|----------------|
| Pain Points | What customers complain about most |
| Buying Factors | Why customers chose this product |
| Improvements | What customers wish was better |
| Positives | What customers love |
| Issues | Specific product problems |
| Scenarios | How/where customers use the product |
| Keywords | Trending terms in reviews |
| User Profiles | Who is buying (demographics, use cases) |
| Usage Times | When customers use the product |
| Usage Locations | Where customers use the product |
| Behaviors | Customer behavior patterns |

### Three Analysis Modes

- **Single ASIN**: Deep-dive into one product's reviews
- **Multi-ASIN Comparison**: Compare pain points and strengths across competitors
- **Category-wide**: Analyze consumer sentiment across an entire product category

### What Makes This Different

- **1B+ pre-analyzed reviews**: API returns structured insights instantly — no token-heavy NLP processing needed
- **11 API endpoints**: Not just reviews — cross-validates with brand data, pricing, competitor listings, and trends
- **95% token savings**: Structured output vs. feeding raw reviews to an LLM
