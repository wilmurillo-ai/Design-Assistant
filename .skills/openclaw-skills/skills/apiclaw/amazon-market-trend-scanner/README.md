# Amazon Market Trend Scanner — APIClaw Agent Skill

> Find rising categories before everyone else.

## What This Skill Does

Scans Amazon category landscapes to discover trending subcategories, emerging niches, and market shifts.

- **7 key metrics per subcategory**: Sales, new SKU rate, brand concentration, avg price, gross margin, total SKUs, FBA rate
- **Trend signals**: Demand surge 🔴, red ocean warning 🔴, new entrant wave 🟡, brand loosening 🟡, price/margin shifts 🟡
- **Dual mode**: Full Scan for discovery, Quick Check for scheduled monitoring with auto-alerts
