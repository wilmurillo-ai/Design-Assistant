# Gate Info Liveroom Location — Live & Replay Listing

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read `./references/gate-runtime-rules.md`
→ Also read `./references/info-news-runtime-rules.md` for gate-info / gate-news shared rules (tool degradation, report standards, security, and output standards).
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

## MCP Dependencies

### Required MCP Servers
| MCP Server | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Gate-Info | ✅ Required |

### Authentication
- API Key Required: No
- Credentials Source: None; this skill uses read-only Gate Info / Gate News MCP access only.

### Installation Check
- Required: Gate-Info
- Install: Use the local Gate MCP installation flow for the current host IDE before continuing.
- Continue only after the required Gate MCP server is available in the current environment.

## MCP Mode

**Read and strictly follow** [`references/mcp.md`](./references/mcp.md), then execute this skill's live/replay listing workflow.

- `SKILL.md` keeps intent mapping, product behavior, and response semantics.
- `references/mcp.md` is the authoritative MCP execution layer for parameter extraction, single-endpoint calls, and degradation handling.

## Workflow

When the user asks about live rooms or replays (by business type, coin, hottest/newest, or count), execute the following steps.

### Step 1: Parse intent and map parameters

From natural language, extract and map to API parameters:

- **tag**: Market Analysis | Hot Topics | Blockchain | Others | empty (all). Default: empty.
- **coin**: Coin symbol (e.g. BTC, SOL) or empty (all). Default: empty.
- **sort**: `hot` (hottest) | `new` (newest). Default: `hot`.
- **limit**: Integer 1–10. Default: 10.

Key mapping rules:

| User phrase (examples) | Param | Value |
|------------------------|--------|--------|
| 行情分析, 市场分析, Market Analysis | tag | Market Analysis |
| 热门话题, Hot Topics | tag | Hot Topics |
| 区块链, Blockchain | tag | Blockchain |
| 其他, Others | tag | Others |
| Not mentioned | tag | empty |
| Bitcoin, BTC, SOL, ETH, 比特币 | coin | BTC, SOL, etc. |
| Not mentioned | coin | empty |
| 最热, 热门, 按热度, hottest | sort | hot |
| 最新, 最近, newest | sort | new |
| Not mentioned | sort | hot |
| 前5条, 给我3个, 10个 | limit | 5, 3, 10 |
| Not mentioned | limit | 10 |

**Do not** ask the user "how many?" or "which coin?" when they did not specify; apply defaults.

### Step 2: Call the API

Call `GET /live/gate_ai/tag_coin_live_replay` with query parameters:

- `tag`: string (optional)
- `coin`: string (optional)
- `sort`: `hot` | `new` (optional, default hot)
- `limit`: integer (optional, default 10, max 10)

Key data to extract from response:

- `data.list`: array of items, each with `content_type` (`"streaming"` or `"video"`), and either `live` (with `id`, `name`) or `video` (with `id`, `title`).

**Pre-filter**: If the user is in a restricted region (US, Canada, Japan, or other Gate-restricted regions), do **not** call the API; reply that the feature is not available in their region.

### Step 3: Build list output

For each item in `data.list`:

- **Title**: `live.name` when `content_type === "streaming"`, else `video.title` when `content_type === "video"`.
- **Link**:
  - `content_type === "streaming"`: `https://www.gate.io/live/video/{live.id}?type=live`
  - `content_type === "video"`: `https://www.gate.io/live/video/{video.id}`

Output a list of lines: each line = **title** + **link**. Optionally label "Live" or "Replay". Do not add extra fields (e.g. likes, duration) unless required by product.

## Judgment Logic Summary

| Condition | Signal | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| User in restricted region | Block | Do not call API; reply that the feature is not available in their region |
| tag / coin / sort / limit not mentioned | Use default | tag=empty, coin=empty, sort=hot, limit=10 |
| content_type === "streaming" | Live | Use live.name; link with `?type=live` |
| content_type === "video" | Replay | Use video.title; link without type |
| Empty list or API error | No list | Reply with a short message; do not fabricate a list |

## Report Template

- **List format**: One line per item: `[Live/Replay] Title — <link>`.
- **Disclaimer** (if needed): Gate live and replay content is provided by creators; it does not constitute investment or viewing advice; the platform only provides display and filtering.

## Single API only

Use only `GET /live/gate_ai/tag_coin_live_replay`. Do not combine or mention other live or video APIs.
