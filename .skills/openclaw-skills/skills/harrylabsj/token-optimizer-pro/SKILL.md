# Token Optimizer Pro

Monitor OpenClaw token usage and turn the data into actionable optimization guidance.

## What It Helps With

- track token usage across agents and models
- analyze usage trends over time
- estimate current and projected cost
- identify abnormal spikes or inefficient patterns
- generate concrete token-saving suggestions
- define alert thresholds for high usage

## Typical Commands

```bash
token-optimizer status
token-optimizer report
token-optimizer report --days 7
token-optimizer report --agent code
token-optimizer suggest
token-optimizer alert --daily-limit 100000
token-optimizer alert --session-limit 50000
```

## Example Questions

- Which agent is using the most tokens?
- Which model is the most expensive this week?
- Did usage spike yesterday?
- Where can I reduce token cost by 20%?

## Optimization Areas

- model selection
- context trimming
- session management
- tool usage efficiency
