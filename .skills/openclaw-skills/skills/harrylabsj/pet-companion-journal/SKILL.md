# Pet Companion Journal

## Overview

Use this skill to maintain a local-first companion archive for one or more pets. Record profiles, daily moments, feeding changes, photos, health history, and reminders in a way that stays organized per pet and is easy to search later.

This skill is best for:
- creating or updating pet profiles
- recording daily logs, warm moments, and growth notes
- attaching photos and captions to a pet timeline
- tracking food, supplements, and feeding changes
- storing symptom, clinic, medication, vaccine, and deworming notes
- checking upcoming care reminders
- reviewing a pet’s recent history or exporting a summary

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the pet first
Always determine which pet the record belongs to.

Rules:
- if the household has only one pet, you may infer the pet after a quick confirmation when needed
- if the user has multiple pets and did not specify which one, ask before writing
- for reads, prefer showing likely matches and ask only if ambiguous

Use `scripts/pet_manager.py list` or `view` to inspect existing pets.

### 2. Create or update the pet profile
When the user is creating a profile, collect the minimum useful fields first:
- name
- species
- birthday or approximate age
- breed if known
- gender if known

Optional fields:
- nickname
- adoption date
- neutered status
- color markings
- personality tags
- notes
- avatar photo reference

Use `scripts/pet_manager.py create` and `update`.

### 3. Add records by type
Use `scripts/record_add.py` to save records under the correct pet.

Supported record types:
- `daily`: ordinary daily notes
- `moment`: warm scenes, funny moments, growth milestones
- `photo`: a photo plus caption and optional media path
- `feeding`: food, supplements, quantity, feeding change notes
- `health`: symptoms, clinic visits, medicines, vaccines, deworming, follow-up
- `reminder-note`: notes related to reminders or care planning

If the user gives semi-structured text, store the narrative in the body and place structured fields such as symptom lists, medicine names, or scene labels inside `extra`.

### 4. Manage reminders
Use `scripts/reminder_manage.py` to create or list per-pet reminders.
Use `scripts/reminder_check.py` to find due or upcoming reminders.

Typical reminder types:
- birthday
- vaccine
- deworming
- checkup
- grooming
- bath
- refill-food
- medication
- follow-up

### 5. Query and review
Use `scripts/record_query.py` for structured retrieval.
Support filtering by:
- pet
- record type
- time range
- keyword

Use `scripts/export_report.py` to produce a compact summary for a time range.

## Output Rules

- Keep responses warm, clear, and organized.
- For write actions, confirm what was saved and under which pet.
- For read actions, prefer concise summaries plus the most relevant entries.
- For health-related notes, record and organize them, but do not present veterinary diagnosis.
- If a photo path or detail is uncertain, label it as a note or estimate instead of pretending certainty.

## Storage Rules

Default storage root: `~/.pet-companion/`

Structure:
- `pets/`: one JSON profile per pet
- `records/YYYY/MM/`: markdown records with JSON frontmatter
- `reminders/`: one JSON reminder file per pet
- `media/YYYY/MM/`: pet photos or attachment files
- `reports/`: exported summaries if needed

See:
- `references/data-schema.md`
- `references/query-patterns.md`
- `references/template-examples.md`
- `references/safety-boundaries.md`

## Privacy and Safety

This skill is local-first. Do not share pet photos, clinic notes, or identifying details unless the user explicitly asks. This skill may organize health records, but it must not act like a veterinary diagnosis or treatment tool. If the user describes urgent symptoms, advise prompt veterinary care.
