# Second Brain AI Skill v2.0 (Repair Build)

A lightweight skill for working with a user-chosen Markdown knowledge base with controlled write operations and attribution requirements.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- Environment variable `SECOND_BRAIN_VAULT` must be set explicitly
- Optional: Frontmatter support (YAML)
- Optional: WikiLinks support `[[Note Title]]`

## Configuration

```bash
export SECOND_BRAIN_VAULT="/absolute/path/to/your/vault"
```

## Safety Boundaries

- Only operates within the configured vault path
- Write operations require `allow_write: true`
- Append operations require `appended_by` attribution

## Tools

### 1. init_vault
Initialize a new vault with standard folder structure.

**Input:** `{ "allow_write": true }`

### 2. capture_note
Create a new note.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "allow_write": true,
  "title": "Note Title",
  "content": "Body content",
  "type": "idea",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "links": ["Related Note"]
}
```

### 3. append_note
Append content to an existing note with attribution.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "allow_write": true,
  "title": "Note Title",
  "content": "Additional content",
  "section": "Updates",
  "appended_by": "Agent Name"
}
```

**Required:** `appended_by` must identify who is appending.

### 4. search_notes
Search notes by keywords.

**Input:** `{ "query": "search terms", "limit": 5 }`

### 5. find_related
Find notes related to a topic.

**Input:** `{ "topic": "Topic Name", "limit": 5 }`

### 6. get_backlinks
Get notes that link to a specific note.

**Input:** `{ "note_title": "Target Note" }`

### 7. build_context_pack
Build a context pack for agent consumption.

**Input:** `{ "topic": "Topic", "limit": 10 }`

### 8. suggest_links
Get smart link suggestions for a note.

**Input:** `{ "title": "Note Title", "limit": 5 }`

### 9. rebuild_index
Refresh index (currently returns skip status as SQLite is not implemented).

**Input:** `{}`

## Note Format

Standard frontmatter:
```yaml
---
id: 20260313
title: Note Title
type: idea
tags: [tag1, tag2]
created: 2026-03-13
updated: 2026-03-13
status: active
---
```

## Append Attribution Format

When appending, the skill adds:
```markdown
> Append Record
> Added by: {appended_by}
> Added at: {timestamp}

{content}
```

## Limitations (Repair Build)

- SQLite indexing is not implemented; uses file-based scanning
- No semantic/vector search
- No automatic link insertion
- No conflict detection
- Single vault only

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```
