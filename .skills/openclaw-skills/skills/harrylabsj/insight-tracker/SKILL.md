# Insight Tracker

## Overview

This skill provides structured insight management for OpenClaw workflows. It captures observations, patterns, and learnings that emerge during sessions, making them searchable, referenceable, and actionable.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- A user mentions "note this down" or "remember this insight"
- Patterns emerge across multiple sessions that should be tracked
- Research or analysis reveals findings worth preserving
- The user asks to "track" or "record" something for future reference
- Cross-referencing insights with existing knowledge is needed

## Core Concepts

### Insight
An insight is a discrete observation, pattern, or learning with the following attributes:
- **Content**: The actual observation or finding
- **Source**: Where it came from (session, research, user input)
- **Tags**: Categories for organization
- **Priority**: Importance level (high/medium/low)
- **Status**: Current state (active/validated/archived)
- **Created**: Timestamp
- **References**: Links to related insights or knowledge

### Tags
Standard tags for categorization:
- `pattern`: Recurring behaviors or structures
- `learning`: New understanding or skill acquired
- `decision`: Choices made and their rationale
- `risk`: Potential issues or concerns
- `opportunity`: Potential improvements or wins
- `user-preference`: User-specific preferences
- `technical`: Technical findings or constraints
- `process`: Workflow or methodological insights

## Input

Accepts insights in various formats:
- Direct text input
- Session transcript excerpts
- Memory file references
- Research findings

## Output

Produces:
- Dated insight records (Markdown)
- Tagged insight summaries
- Cross-reference reports
- Insight search results

## Workflow

### Recording an Insight

1. **Capture**: Extract the core observation
2. **Tag**: Apply relevant category tags
3. **Prioritize**: Mark importance level
4. **Link**: Connect to related insights
5. **Store**: Save to dated record

### Retrieving Insights

1. **Search**: By tag, keyword, date, or priority
2. **Filter**: Narrow by status or category
3. **Present**: Show matching insights with context

### Analyzing Insights

1. **Cluster**: Group related insights
2. **Trend**: Identify patterns over time
3. **Validate**: Check against new evidence
4. **Archive**: Mark outdated insights

## Commands

### Add Insight
```
insight add "Content of the insight" --tags pattern,learning --priority high
```

### List Insights
```
insight list --tag pattern --since 2024-01-01
```

### Search Insights
```
insight search "keyword" --priority high
```

### Show Insight
```
insight show <insight-id>
```

### Archive Insight
```
insight archive <insight-id>
```

## Output Format

### Dated Insight Record

```markdown
# Insights - YYYY-MM-DD

## New Insights

### INS-001: Title
- **Content**: The insight content
- **Source**: Session/user/research
- **Tags**: pattern, learning
- **Priority**: high
- **Status**: active
- **Created**: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
- **References**: INS-003, knowledge-distillation-2024-01-10

## Summary
- Total insights: 5
- High priority: 2
- New tags: user-preference
```

## Quality Rules

- Be specific: avoid vague generalizations
- Include source: always note where insight came from
- Tag consistently: use standard tags
- Link related insights: build knowledge networks
- Review regularly: archive outdated insights
- Prioritize honestly: not everything is high priority

## Good Trigger Examples

- "Track this insight: users prefer X over Y"
- "Note down that we discovered a pattern in Z"
- "Search for insights about deployment issues"
- "Show me all high priority insights from last week"
- "Archive insight INS-005, it's no longer relevant"
