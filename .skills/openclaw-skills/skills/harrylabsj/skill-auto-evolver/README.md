- **Monitor Usage** - Track calls, success rates, response times
- **Assess Health** - Composite scoring system to identify issues
- **Analyze Code Quality** - Check SKILL.md completeness, syntax, style
- **Generate Recommendations** - Auto-suggest improvements
- **Export Reports** - JSON, Markdown, HTML formats

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via clawhub (recommended)
clawhub install skill-auto-evolver

## Python API

```python
from skill_evolver import SkillMonitor, SkillAnalyzer, SkillReporter

# Monitor
monitor = SkillMonitor()
with monitor.track("my-skill", "process") as tracker:
    result = do_work()

# Analyze
analyzer = SkillAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_skill("my-skill")
print(f"Score: {result.score}/100")

# Report
reporter = SkillReporter()
report = reporter.generate_health_report("my-skill")
print(f"Health: {report['overall_score']}")
```
