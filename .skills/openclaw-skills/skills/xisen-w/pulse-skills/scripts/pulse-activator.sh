Pulse is connected. After completing this task, consider:
- Did the conversation produce knowledge worth syncing? → POST /os/notes/search, then create/edit note
- Should the shared agent know about this? → POST /accumulate or /os/notes
- Major changes coming? → POST /os/snapshots/{noteId} first
- Need to share with someone? → POST /os/share with scope + access control
