## 📋 TESTNET VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before moving to mainnet, validate:

- [x] Agent decision logic is deterministic and correct
- [x] Transaction execution handles failures gracefully
- [x] Gas estimates are accurate (±10%)
- [x] Scheduler executes on schedule
- [x] Notifications send correctly
- [x] Data persistence works reliably
- [ ] **PENDING:** Full 72-hour continuous operation test
- [ ] **PENDING:** Stress test with 1000+ cycles
- [ ] **PENDING:** Recovery testing after network outages

## 🚨 CRITICAL BEFORE PRODUCTION

### Must Complete
1. **Wallet Security** - NO raw private keys in config files
2. **Oracle Integration** - Real price feeds from Chainlink
3. **Smart Contract Audit** - Formal security review
4. **Emergency Pause** - Ability to stop all operations immediately
5. **Mainnet Contracts** - Deployed and tested on production network

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Start with Small Amounts** - Begin with 1% of intended capital
2. **Gradual Scaling** - Increase allocation over weeks
3. **Monitoring Coverage** - 24/7 alert monitoring setup
4. **Fallback Procedures** - Manual intervention procedures documented
5. **Insurance** - DeFi protocol insurance coverage

## 📞 SUPPORT & ESCALATION

**Critical Issues:**
- Scheduler downtime → Immediate restart + alert
- Transaction failures → Log + retry + notify
- Balance mismatches → Pause + investigate

- DevOps: `devops@yieldfarming.agent`
- Security: `security@yieldfarming.agent`
- Emergency: `emergency@yieldfarming.agent`

## 🔐 Security Reminders

⚠️ **NEVER**:
- Hardcode private keys
- Use mock data in production
- Skip security audits
- Bypass wallet limits
- Run without monitoring

✅ **ALWAYS**:
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement multi-sig for mainnet
- Test thoroughly before deployment
- Monitor all transactions
- Have emergency pause ready
