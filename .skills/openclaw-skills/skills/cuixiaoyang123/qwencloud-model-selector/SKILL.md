# Qwen Model Selector (Advisor)

This skill operates in two modes:

1. **Interactive advisory** — asks diagnostic questions to recommend the right model (see Diagnostic Flow).
2. **Cross-skill resolution** — provides a fast-path model lookup for execution skills that need a model decision
   without user interaction (see Cross-Skill Model Resolution).

Do not fabricate model names — only recommend models listed in this skill.
This skill is part of **qwencloud/qwencloud-ai**.

## Skill directory

Use this skill's reference files for data and learning. Load on demand — do not fetch external URLs unless the user
explicitly asks for latest data.

## Security

**NEVER output any API key or credential in plaintext.** Always use variable references (`$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` in shell,
`os.environ["QWEN_API_KEY"]` in Python). Any check or detection of credentials must be **non-plaintext**: report
only status (e.g. "set" / "not set", "valid" / "invalid"), never the value. Never display contents of `.env` or config
files that may contain secrets.

## Coding Plan Models

Users with a [Coding Plan](https://www.qwencloud.com/pricing/coding-plan) subscription have access to a
limited set of models through their coding tools only:

| Model                | Context | Thinking             |
|----------------------|--------:|----------------------|
| qwen3.5-plus         |      1M | Yes (budget: 81,920) |
| kimi-k2.5            |    256K | Yes (budget: 81,920) |
| glm-5                |    198K | Yes (budget: 32,768) |
| MiniMax-M2.5         |    192K | Yes (budget: 32,768) |
| qwen3-max-2026-01-23 |    256K | Yes (budget: 81,920) |
| qwen3-coder-next     |    256K | No                   |
| qwen3-coder-plus     |      1M | No                   |
| glm-4.7              |    198K | Yes (budget: 32,768) |

Coding Plan does **not** include image, video, TTS, or specialized vision models. When recommending models, note if the
user's chosen model falls outside this list and they are using a Coding Plan key (`sk-sp-...`). If qwencloud-ops-auth is
installed, see its `references/codingplan.md` for the full model list and error codes.

## Diagnostic Flow

Ask the user (in order):

1. **Content type?** — text / image / video / audio / vision
2. **Primary task?** — generation / understanding / coding / reasoning / translation
3. **Priority?** — quality vs speed vs cost
4. **Input size?** — short / medium / long context
5. **Structured output?** — JSON / function calling needed?

## Cross-Skill Model Resolution

When an execution skill needs to choose a model, evaluate across three dimensions: **Requirement → Scenario →
Pricing**. If the user explicitly specified a model, use it as given — but still verify availability; if
restricted, warn the user and suggest an alternative.

### Dimension 1 · Requirement (select)

Match task capability to the right model. Use when the user's need points to a specialized model, or when the task is
ambiguous and you need to compare capabilities.

### Dimension 2 · Scenario (tune)

Adjust model tier based on how the model will be used.

| Pattern                 | Signals                                 | Guidance                                                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interactive / real-time | "chat", "real-time", "interactive"      | Prefer flash/turbo variants; enable streaming                           |
| Batch / offline         | "batch", "offline", "background"        | Quality model + Batch API (50% off)                                     |
| One-off trial           | "try", "test", "experiment"             | Quality model; check if free quota is still available in user's console |
| High-volume production  | "production", "at scale", "high volume" | Cost-optimize: flash/turbo + context cache                              |
| Repeated context        | "template", "same prompt", "repeated"   | Enable context caching for input token discount                         |

### Dimension 3 · Pricing (optimize)

Given the candidates from dimensions 1–2, compare costs and apply modifiers.

- Pricing reference: [pricing.md](references/pricing.md). For the latest rates, check
  the [official pricing page](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing).
- **Free quota**: Some models offer a limited free quota after activation. However, quotas may have been consumed,
  expired, or changed. **Never assume remaining free quota** — always present the paid unit price.
- **Batch API**: 50% off both input and output tokens for non-realtime workloads.
- **Context cache**: Input token discount for repeated/templated contexts.
- **Tiered pricing**: Some models charge more per token as input length increases — check pricing tables for
  breakpoints.
- When cost is the user's primary concern, explicitly recommend the cheapest viable model and cite the price.

> **Degradation**: If this skill is not loaded or not available, each execution skill falls back to its own built-in
> default. This protocol is purely additive — it enhances model selection but never blocks execution.

## Pricing Guidance

- **Default pricing**: [pricing.md](references/pricing.md) — International, USD.
  For the latest rates, check
  the [official pricing page](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing).
- **Latest prices**: When the user explicitly asks for exact/latest pricing, see [sources.md](references/sources.md) for
  official URLs.
- **Cost formula**: `Cost = Tokens ÷ 1,000,000 × Unit price`. 1K Chinese chars ≈ 1,200-1,500 tokens.
- **Free quota**: Some models offer a limited free quota after activation — but quotas may have been consumed, expired,
  or changed without notice. **Always present the paid unit price first.** Mention free quota only as something the user
  should verify in their [QwenCloud console](https://home.qwencloud.com/free-quota).
- **Cost tips**:
    - Use Batch calling for 50% off in non-realtime scenarios
    - Enable context cache for repeated contexts
    - Use flash/turbo series for non-critical tasks

### Cost Estimation Disclaimer (MANDATORY)

> 🚨 **CRITICAL — NO EXCEPTIONS**: **NEVER fabricate, invent, or guess any price figure.** If you do not have a
> confirmed price from `references/pricing.md` or the official pricing page, you **MUST NOT** output any number.
> Instead, direct the user to
> the [official pricing page](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing).
> Outputting a made-up price is a **critical failure** — worse than saying "I don't know."

When responding to **any** cost-related query — including but not limited to price evaluation, usage estimation, budget
forecasting, or cost comparison — you **MUST** append a professional disclaimer. This applies regardless of language or
response format.

**Required disclaimer (Chinese response):**

> ⚠️ **费用说明**：以上费用为基于官方公示单价的预估价格，仅供参考。实际费用受 Token
> 消耗量、上下文长度阶梯定价、Batch/缓存折扣及计费策略调整等因素影响，请以QwenCloud控制台的实际账单为准。部分模型可能提供限时免费额度，但免费额度的可用性、额度量及有效期随时可能调整，请在控制台确认您的账户是否仍有剩余额度，**切勿假设本次调用免费**。最新定价详见 [模型定价页](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing)。

**Required disclaimer (English response):**

> ⚠️ **Pricing Notice**: The cost figures above are **estimates** calculated from officially published unit prices and
> are provided for reference only. Actual charges depend on token consumption, tiered context-length pricing,
> Batch/cache discounts, and billing policy updates. Some models may offer a time-limited free quota, but
> quota availability, amounts, and validity periods are subject to change — **do not assume this call is free**. Please
> verify your remaining quota in
> the [QwenCloud console](https://home.qwencloud.com/free-quota) and refer to the actual
> bill for definitive costs. See [Model Pricing](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing) for
> the latest rates.

**Rules:**

- The disclaimer must appear at the **end** of every cost-related response, clearly separated from the main content.
- When the estimate involves assumptions (e.g., average tokens per character, assumed context length tier), **explicitly
  state each assumption** used in the calculation.
- Never present estimated costs as exact or guaranteed amounts. Use hedging language such as "approximately", "estimated
  at", "roughly" (or Chinese equivalents "约", "预估", "约合") throughout the cost breakdown.
- **Never tell the user a call will be free or cost $0/¥0.** Even if a free quota exists, the user may have already
  consumed it. Always present the paid price and note that a free quota *may* apply — subject to the user verifying in
  their console.
- **If pricing data is unavailable or uncertain, say so explicitly and link to the official pricing page. Never fill
  the gap with a guess.**

Several models support hybrid thinking/non-thinking modes:

| Model                               | Thinking Default | Notes                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| qwen3.5-plus                        | **On**           | Thinking enabled by default. Use `enable_thinking: false` to disable.                         |
| qwen3.5-flash                       | **On**           | Thinking enabled by default.                                                                  |
| qwen3-max                           | Off              | Use `enable_thinking: true` for complex reasoning. Built-in tools available in thinking mode. |
| qwen-plus / qwen-flash / qwen-turbo | Off              | Hybrid; enable for deeper reasoning at higher output cost.                                    |
| qwen3-vl-plus / qwen3-vl-flash      | Off              | Vision + thinking for complex visual analysis.                                                |
| qwen3-omni-flash                    | Off              | Thinking supported; audio output not available in thinking mode.                              |
| qwq-plus / qvq-max                  | Always on        | Pure reasoning models; CoT always active.                                                     |

**Guidance**: Do not enable thinking by default for simple or conversational tasks — it increases latency and output
token cost. Enable only when the user explicitly asks for deep reasoning or the task requires multi-step analysis.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Only recommend models listed in this skill** — never fabricate model names.
- **When unsure**, use `qwen3.5-plus` as a safe default for text tasks.
- **🚨 NEVER invent or guess any price figure** — only use pricing from `references/pricing.md` or the
  [official pricing page](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing). If the data is not
  available, say so and link to the official page. **Fabricating a price is a critical failure.**
- **Always cite data source** when providing pricing info.
- **Default currency is USD.** Check
  the [official pricing page](https://docs.qwencloud.com/developer-guides/getting-started/pricing) for the latest rates.
  Writing in Chinese does NOT imply CNY.
- **All cost estimates must include the mandatory disclaimer** — use hedging language ("approximately", "estimated").
  Omitting the disclaimer is a critical violation.
- **Never assume free quota is available** — free quotas may have been consumed, expired, or removed. Never tell the
  user a call will cost $0/¥0. Always present the paid unit price first; mention free quota only as a possibility the
  user should verify in their console.
- **Do NOT proactively fetch URLs or trigger web searches** — only access online sources when the user explicitly asks
  for "latest" data AND reference files cannot answer.
- **Never output API keys in plaintext** — see Security section above.

## Online Information Sources

Reference files in this skill are point-in-time snapshots. For official documentation URLs,
see [sources.md](references/sources.md).

**Do NOT proactively fetch or search online.** Only access online sources when ALL of these conditions are met:

1. The user explicitly asks for "latest", "real-time", or "current" data.
2. The reference files in this skill cannot answer the question.
3. The user confirms they want an online lookup.

## Update Check (MANDATORY Post-Execution)

When the user asks to check for updates (e.g. "check for updates", "check version", "is there a new version", "update
skills"):

1. **Find qwencloud-update-check**: Look for `qwencloud-update-check/SKILL.md` in sibling skill directories.
2. **If found** — run: `python3 <qwencloud-update-check-dir>/scripts/check_update.py --print-response` and report the result.
   Use `--force` if the user asks to force-check.
3. **If not found** — you MUST present the following options and **wait for the user's response**:

> The update-check skill is not installed. It keeps you informed about new qwencloud/qwencloud-ai features and bug fixes.
>
> 1) **Install now** — I'll run the install command for you
> 2) **Skip for now** — do nothing this time
> 3) **Never remind me** — permanently suppress this prompt

After the user responds:

- User chooses **1** → run:
  `npx skills add QwenCloud/qwencloud-ai --skill qwencloud-update-check -y`, then run:
  `python3 <this-skill-scripts-dir>/gossamer.py --dismiss`
- User chooses **2** → run: `python3 <this-skill-scripts-dir>/gossamer.py --dismiss`, then continue normally
- User chooses **3** → run: `python3 <this-skill-scripts-dir>/gossamer.py --never-install`, then continue normally
