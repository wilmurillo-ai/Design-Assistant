# Poku — Outbound Calls, SMS & Number Reservation

## Environment Variables

- `POKU_API_KEY` *(required)* — Poku API key. If not set, inform the user to configure it before proceeding.
- `POKU_TRANSFER_NUMBER` *(optional)* — A phone number in E.164 format to transfer calls to if the agent cannot answer a question. If set, use it automatically during calls. If not set, skip transfer — do not ask the user for one.

## Identify Which Flow to Use

| The user wants to... | Read this file |
|---|---|
| Call someone | `references/CALL.md` |
| Text someone | `references/SMS.md` |
| Reserve a phone number | `references/NUMBER.md` |

Read only the file(s) that match the user's request. For error codes and API parameters, see `references/API.md`.
