# Polymarket Research Strategy

**PARENT**: This is a sub-strategy of `paper-trader`. Portfolio-level rules in `../../SKILL.md` take precedence.

**ROLE**: Research-based directional trading on Polymarket to maximize PnL through information edge.

## Orchestrator Integration

**Report to parent orchestrator:**
- Log all trades to `references/research_journal.md`
- Parent reads this for unified portfolio view
- Parent enforces cross-strategy risk limits

**Check parent before trading:**
- Verify portfolio-level exposure limits in `../../references/master_portfolio.md`
- Check correlation with PM Arb positions (same markets)
- Check correlation with Memecoin (crypto price markets)
- Respect parent's risk level (🟢/🟡/🟠/🔴)

**Your job within the system:**
1. Research markets deeply to find informational edge
2. Develop probability estimates better than market consensus
3. Paper trade directional positions with documented thesis
4. Track calibration and refine research methodology
5. Strategy-level Telegram updates flow through parent orchestrator

## Core Research Framework

### The Edge Equation

```
Expected Value = (Your Probability × Payout) - (Your Probability of Loss × Stake)

You profit when: Your probability estimate > Market probability + fees
```

### Research Categories

#### Category 1: Information Aggregation
Synthesize public information better than the market.

**Sources**:
- News sites (Reuters, AP, Bloomberg, NYT, WSJ)
- Primary sources (government docs, court filings, official statements)
- Domain expert Twitter/X accounts
- Academic papers and polls
- Historical data and base rates

**Edge**: Markets are slow to process dispersed information

#### Category 2: Base Rate Analysis
Use historical patterns to estimate probabilities.

**Method**:
1. Find reference class of similar events
2. Calculate base rate from history
3. Adjust for specific factors
4. Compare to market price

**Edge**: Markets often anchor on recent events, ignore base rates

#### Category 3: Incentive Analysis
Understand what actors will do based on incentives.

**Questions**:
- What do key actors want?
- What are their constraints?
- What would a rational actor do?
- What's the political economy?

**Edge**: Markets underweight game theory

#### Category 4: Technical/Domain Expertise
Apply specialized knowledge to niche markets.

**Areas**:
- Crypto/blockchain events
- Specific sports analytics
- Political science models
- Legal procedure knowledge
- Weather/climate patterns

**Edge**: Retail traders lack domain expertise

#### Category 5: Sentiment Divergence
Identify when market sentiment diverges from fundamentals.

**Signals**:
- Social media volume vs actual probability
- News narrative vs data
- Emotional reactions vs base rates

**Edge**: Markets overreact to narratives

## Research Protocol

### For Each Market You Consider

1. **Initial Screen** (5 mins)
   - What's the question exactly?
   - When does it resolve?
   - What's the current price?
   - Is there enough volume/liquidity?

2. **Research Phase** (30-60 mins)
   - Gather all relevant public information
   - Search news from multiple sources
   - Find primary sources if possible
   - Check what experts say
   - Look for base rate data

3. **Probability Estimation**
   - Start with base rate if available
   - List factors that adjust probability up
   - List factors that adjust probability down
   - Arrive at your probability estimate
   - Calculate confidence interval

4. **Edge Calculation**
   ```
   Your estimate: X%
   Market price: Y%
   Fee-adjusted breakeven: Y% + 2%
   Edge = X% - (Y% + 2%)

   If Edge > 5%: Strong opportunity
   If Edge 2-5%: Moderate opportunity
   If Edge < 2%: Skip
   ```

5. **Thesis Documentation**
   Document in `references/thesis_library.md`

## Paper Trading Protocol

### Starting Parameters
- Initial paper balance: $10,000 USDC
- Max per position: 10% ($1,000)
- Min edge required: 5%
- Position sizing: Kelly criterion (quarter Kelly)

### Kelly Criterion Calculator
```
f* = (p × (b + 1) - 1) / b

Where:
- f* = fraction of bankroll to bet
- p = your probability estimate
- b = odds (payout / stake - 1)

Use quarter Kelly (f* / 4) to be conservative
```

## Self-Improvement Protocol

### After Every 10 Resolved Trades

1. **Calculate metrics**:
   - Win rate
   - Brier score (probability calibration)
   - Average edge captured
   - P&L by category
   - Research time vs edge found

2. **Calibration Analysis**:
   ```
   For each probability bucket (e.g., 70-80%):
   - How many trades were in this bucket?
   - What was the actual win rate?
   - Am I overconfident or underconfident?
   ```

3. **Update `references/strategy_evolution.md`**:
   ```markdown
   ## Iteration #[N] - [DATE]
