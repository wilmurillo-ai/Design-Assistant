## Naming Patterns

Good agent names are:
- **Short** (1-2 syllables ideal)
- **Evocative** of the role (Scout for research, Forge for building)
- **Distinct** from each other (don't name two agents with similar sounds)
- **Not generic** (never "Agent-1" or "ResearchBot")

Naming themes that work:
- **Action words:** Scout, Forge, Vault, Dial, Pen
- **Archetypes:** Chief, Sage, Knight, Herald
- **Pop culture:** Star Wars names, mythology, etc. (if user has a preference)
- **Domain words:** Pixel, Metric, Quill, Code

The user picks the theme. If they don't have a preference, use action/archetype names.
