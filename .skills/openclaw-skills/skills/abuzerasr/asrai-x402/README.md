# Asrai — Crypto Analysis Skill

Crypto market analysis skill for AI agents. Powered by [Asrai](https://asrai.me) via x402 — pay $0.005 USDC per call, no subscription needed.

Works with **OpenClaw**, **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **Cline**, and any MCP-compatible or bash-capable agent.

---

## Install

### One command — works everywhere

```bash
npx -y -p asrai-mcp@latest install-skill
```

Auto-detects OpenClaw, Cursor, Cline, and other agents. Copies SKILL.md to the right place. Then restart your agent or run "refresh skills".

### Manual — OpenClaw (if auto-detect fails)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abuzerasr/asrai-skill.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/asrai
```

Then restart OpenClaw or run "refresh skills".

### Manual — Cursor / Cline / other agents

```bash
npx skills add abuzerasr/asrai-skill
```

Or via [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/abuzerasr/asrai-x402) — one-click install.

## Setup

### 1. Set your private key

```bash
echo "ASRAI_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<your_private_key>" >> ~/.env
```

Your wallet must hold USDC on Base mainnet (~$1–2 is plenty).

### 2. Connect the MCP server (Cursor, Cline, Claude Desktop)

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "asrai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "asrai-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Config file locations:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

> **OpenClaw users:** skip this step — OpenClaw uses bash automatically, no MCP config needed.

### 3. n8n / remote connections

```
HTTP Streamable: https://mcp.asrai.me/mcp?key=0x<your_private_key>
SSE (legacy):    https://mcp.asrai.me/sse?key=0x<your_private_key>
```

## How to use

Just ask your agent naturally — it picks the right tool automatically:

> "Do a technical analysis on BTC 4h"
> "What's the market sentiment right now?"
> "Give me a price forecast for ETH"
> "Show me the top gainers"
> "What does ALSAT signal mean?"
> "Analyze SOL and tell me if I should buy"

### OpenClaw — bash commands

OpenClaw runs these commands directly. Same tool names as MCP:

```bash
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai technical_analysis BTC 4h
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai sentiment
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai forecast ETH
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai market_overview
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai ask_ai "Is BTC a good buy right now?"
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai coin_info SOL
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai screener ath
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai smart_money BTC 1d
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai portfolio
npx -y -p asrai-mcp asrai indicator_guide ALSAT
```

## Exchange positions setup

To use the `positions` tool, add your exchange API keys to `~/.env`:

```
# MEXC
MEXC_API_KEY=mx0vgl...
MEXC_SECRET_KEY=your_secret...

# Binance
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key...
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret...

# Lighter
LIGHTER_L1_ADDRESS=0x...
LIGHTER_API_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

Only configure the exchanges you use — tool auto-detects which keys are set.
