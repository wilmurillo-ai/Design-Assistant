# 🛒 Checkout Agent

Automated checkout processing

## What It Does

Streamlines the checkout process for AI-mediated purchases. Validates shipping addresses, compares delivery options and costs, applies promotional codes, and presents a final order summary for user confirmation before purchase completion.

## Usage

When the user mentions buying, purchasing, shopping, or looking for product deals, this skill activates to help find the best options.

### Example Prompts

- "Find me the best deal on [product]"
- "Compare prices for [product] across platforms"
- "Is there a coupon for [product]?"
- "Help me buy [product] under [budget]"

## Configuration

Set up API credentials in environment variables as needed for each supported platform.

## Architecture

```
User Request → Intent Parser → Product Search API → Result Ranker → Recommendation Display
```

## Roadmap

- v0.1: Basic product search via web search
- v0.2: Platform API integration
- v0.3: Price tracking and alerts
- v1.0: Full autonomous purchasing flow
