## Commit Convention

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |

## How It Works

1. Reads your staged diff (or branch diff for PRs)
2. Analyzes what changed — files, functions, intent
3. Generates a message that describes the *why*, not just the *what*
4. Follows your configured convention

No external API calls. Uses your local or configured AI model.
