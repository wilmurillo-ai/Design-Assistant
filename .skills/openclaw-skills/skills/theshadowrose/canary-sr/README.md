# Canary — Agent Safety Tripwire System

**Safety monitoring and tripwire detection for AI agents.**

Protects against unauthorized file access, dangerous commands, and excessive activity. Auto-halts on critical violations. Honeypot tripwires detect snooping.

---

## What It Does

Canary provides three layers of agent safety:

1. **Action Monitoring** - Checks file paths and commands before execution
2. **Tripwire Files** - Honeypot files that should never be accessed
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete logs and pattern detection

### Core Features

**Protected Paths:**
- Block access to sensitive directories (`/etc/`, `~/.ssh/`, etc.)
- Customizable protection list
- Granular operation control (read, write, delete)

**Forbidden Patterns:**
- Regular expression matching for dangerous commands
- Detects `rm -rf /`, `chmod 777`, `curl | sh`, etc.
- Extensible pattern library

**Rate Limiting:**
- Limit file operations, network requests, command executions
- Configurable windows and thresholds
- Prevents runaway agents

**Auto-Halt:**
- Automatically stops agent after violation threshold
- Prevents cascading failures
- Requires manual review to restart

**Tripwire Files:**
- Create honeypot files that should never be accessed
- Detect modifications, deletions, or access
- Hash verification for file integrity

**Audit Trail:**
- Complete action logs
- Violation history
- Pattern detection (rapid violations, repeated targets, time clusters)
- Export to JSON or Markdown

## Quick Start

### Install

No dependencies! Python 3.7+ stdlib only.

```bash
# Copy config example
cp config_example.json config.json

# Edit config with your protected paths
nano config.json
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from canary import CanaryMonitor

# Initialize monitor
canary = CanaryMonitor('config.json')

# Check path before access
is_safe, reason = canary.check_path('/etc/passwd', 'read')
if not is_safe:
    print(f"Blocked: {reason}")
    exit(1)

# Check command before execution
is_safe, reason = canary.check_command('rm -rf /')
if not is_safe:
    print(f"Blocked: {reason}")
    exit(1)

# Get status
status = canary.get_status()
print(f"Violations: {status['violation_count']}/{status['halt_threshold']}")
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Check status
python3 canary.py status

# Check if path is safe
python3 canary.py check-path --path /etc/passwd --operation read

# Check if command is safe
python3 canary.py check-command --command "rm -rf /"

# Reset monitoring (clears violations)
python3 canary.py reset
```

---

## Tripwire Files

Create honeypot files that should never be accessed:

```bash
# Create tripwire
python3 canary_tripwire.py create \
  --path ~/.secrets/fake-api-key.txt \
  --severity critical \
  --description "Honeypot to detect credential snooping"

# List all tripwires
python3 canary_tripwire.py list

# Check for triggered tripwires
python3 canary_tripwire.py check

# View alert history
python3 canary_tripwire.py alerts --limit 10

# Remove tripwire
python3 canary_tripwire.py remove --path ~/.secrets/fake-api-key.txt
```

### Python API

```python
from canary_tripwire import TripwireManager

manager = TripwireManager()

# Create tripwire
manager.create_tripwire(
    path='~/.aws/fake-credentials',
    severity='critical',
    description='Detects AWS credential access'
)

# Check all tripwires
triggered = manager.check_tripwires()
if triggered:
    print(f"⚠️  {len(triggered)} tripwire(s) triggered!")
    for alert in triggered:
        print(f"  - {alert['path']}: {alert['event']}")
```

---

## Audit Reports

Analyze logs and generate safety reports:

```bash
# Summary report
python3 canary_audit.py summary

# View violations by severity
python3 canary_audit.py violations --severity critical

# Timeline of recent events
python3 canary_audit.py timeline --hours 24

# Detect suspicious patterns
python3 canary_audit.py patterns

# Export full report
python3 canary_audit.py export --output report.json --format json
python3 canary_audit.py export --output report.md --format markdown
```

### Python API

```python
from canary_audit import CanaryAuditor

auditor = CanaryAuditor('canary.log')

# Generate summary
summary = auditor.generate_summary_report()
print(f"Total violations: {summary['total_violations']}")

# Get critical violations
critical = auditor.get_violations_by_severity('critical')

# Detect patterns
patterns = auditor.detect_patterns()
if patterns['rapid_violations']:
    print("⚠️  Rapid violation sequence detected!")

# Export report
auditor.export_report('safety-report.md', format='markdown')
```

## Configuration

See `config_example.json` for all options.

### Essential Settings

```json
{
  "protected_paths": [
    "/etc/",
    "~/.ssh/",
    "~/critical-data/"
  ],
  "forbidden_patterns": [
    "rm\\s+-rf\\s+/",
    "chmod\\s+777",
    "curl.*\\|\\s*sh"
  ],
  "halt_threshold": 5,
  "rate_limits": {
    "file_operations": {"limit": 100, "window": 60},
    "command_executions": {"limit": 20, "window": 60}
  }
}
```

## Integration Examples

### With Agent Runtime

```python
from canary import CanaryMonitor

canary = CanaryMonitor('config.json')

def safe_file_read(path):
    """Read file with Canary check."""
    is_safe, reason = canary.check_path(path, 'read')
    if not is_safe:
        raise PermissionError(reason)
    
    with open(path, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()

def safe_command(cmd):
    """Execute command with Canary check."""
    is_safe, reason = canary.check_command(cmd)
    if not is_safe:
        raise PermissionError(reason)
    
    import subprocess
    cmd_list = cmd.split() if isinstance(cmd, str) else cmd
    return subprocess.run(cmd_list, capture_output=True)
```

### Pre-Deployment Checks

```python
# Before deploying agent, verify Canary setup
from canary import CanaryMonitor

canary = CanaryMonitor('config.json')

# Verify protected paths are configured
status = canary.get_status()
if status['protected_paths_count'] == 0:
    print("⚠️  No protected paths configured!")
    exit(1)

# Test tripwire detection
from canary_tripwire import TripwireManager
manager = TripwireManager()

# Create test tripwire
manager.create_tripwire('/tmp/canary-test.txt', severity='high')

# Verify it exists
triggered = manager.check_tripwires()
if not any(t['path'] == '/tmp/canary-test.txt' for t in triggered):
    print("✅ Tripwire system operational")

# Cleanup
manager.remove_tripwire('/tmp/canary-test.txt', delete_file=True)
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous Agent Safety

Deploy Canary alongside autonomous agents to prevent:
- Accidental system file deletion
- Credential exfiltration
- Runaway command execution

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems

Each agent gets its own Canary instance with custom rules:
- Research agent: limited network access
- Coding agent: no production deployments
- Admin agent: full access but strict audit

### 3. Development/Testing

Use Canary during agent development:
- Catch dangerous patterns early
- Test rate limiting behavior
- Verify safety mechanisms work

### 4. Production Monitoring

Run Canary in production:
- Real-time violation alerts
- Audit trail for compliance
- Pattern detection for anomalies

## Best Practices

### Start Conservative

Begin with strict rules, relax as needed:

```json
{
  "protected_paths": ["/"],
  "halt_threshold": 3
}
```

### Use Tripwires Strategically

Place tripwires in sensitive locations:
- Fake credential files
- Empty "secrets" directories
- Decoy config files

### Review Logs Regularly

```bash
# Daily audit
python3 canary_audit.py summary

# Weekly deep dive
python3 canary_audit.py patterns
python3 canary_audit.py export --output weekly-report.md --format markdown
```

### Test Your Configuration

```python
# Verify Canary blocks what it should
canary = CanaryMonitor('config.json')

# These should all be blocked
assert not canary.check_path('/etc/passwd', 'delete')[0]
assert not canary.check_command('rm -rf /')[0]
assert not canary.check_command('chmod 777 /tmp')[0]

print("✅ Canary configuration verified")
```

## Limitations

See [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) for details.

**Key constraints:**
- Pattern matching is regex-based (not semantic analysis)
- No built-in alerting (logs only)
- Tripwires detect access, not intent
- Rate limiting is per-session (doesn't survive restarts)

## Why This Exists

AI agents can do a lot of damage quickly:
- One bad command can delete critical files
- Runaway loops can exhaust resources
- Compromised agents can exfiltrate credentials

Canary provides defense-in-depth:
- **Preventive:** Block dangerous actions before they happen
- **Detective:** Tripwires catch snooping behavior
- **Forensic:** Complete audit trail for post-incident analysis

Simple, zero-dependency safety for autonomous agents.
