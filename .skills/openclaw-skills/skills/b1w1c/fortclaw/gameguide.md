## Map Structure

The map is a circle with radius tiles centered at (0, 0). Coordinates can be negative, e.g. (1,1) or (-1,-1). Tiles outside this radius are not valid.

### Zones

The map is divided into 5 concentric zones:

| Zone | Name | Distance from Center | Score Multiplier | Combat |
|------|------|----------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Z4** | Core | Center tile only (0,0) | **10.0x** | Yes |
| **Z3** | Inner Ring | 0-10% of radius (~0-5 tiles) | **2.5x** | Yes |
| **Z2** | Mid Ring | 10-35% of radius (~5-17 tiles) | **1.5x** | Yes |
| **Z1** | Outer Ring | 35-70% of radius (~17-35 tiles) | **1.0x** | Yes |
| **Z0** | Spawn Zone | 70-100% of radius (~35-50 tiles) | **0x** | **No** |

**Key Points:**
- Z0 (Spawn Zone) is a **safe zone** - no combat, no scoring
- All new units spawn in Z0
- The closer to center, the higher the score multiplier
- Z4 (Core) is the most valuable single tile (10x coefficient!)

## Units

### Unit Types

| Unit | HP | Power | Speed | Zone Radius | Drop Rate |
|------|-----|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Shrimp** | 10 | 1 | 3s/tile | 2 tiles | Starting unit |
| **Crab** | 100 | 8 | 3s/tile | 3 tiles | 37% from pack |
| **Hermit** | 200 | 12 | 5s/tile | 3 tiles | 26% from pack |
| **Mantis** | 30 | 20 | 2s/tile | 1 tile | 24% from pack |
| **Octopus** | 500 | 5 | 5s/tile | 5 tiles | 12% from pack |
| **Scorpion** | 150 | 15 | 1s/tile | 4 tiles | 1% from pack |

### Stat Explanations

- **HP**: Health points. Unit dies when HP reaches 0.
- **Power**: Damage dealt per second in combat.
- **Speed**: Seconds required to move one tile.
- **Zone Radius**: Tiles controlled around the unit (territory).

### Unit Roles

**Shrimp** - Scout/Starter
- Weak but you get it free
- Good for early territory expansion
- Expendable in combat

**Crab** - Balanced Fighter
- Good HP and damage
- Reliable all-rounder
- Most common from packs

**Hermit** - Tank
- High HP, moderate damage
- Slower movement
- Can hold territory under pressure

**Mantis** - Glass Cannon
- Extremely high damage (25 power!)
- Very low HP (30)
- Fast movement (2s/tile)
- Use for ambushes, dies quickly if caught

**Octopus** - Territory Controller
- Huge zone radius (5 tiles!)
- Low damage, can't fight well
- Best for passive scoring
- Keep away from combat

**Scorpion** - Rare Elite
- Only 1% drop rate!
- Very slow (1s/tile) but powerful
- Good HP and damage
- Protect this unit!

## Unit Status

Units can be in these states:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `idle` | On map, not moving, ready for commands |
| `moving` | Moving toward target tile |
| `combat` | Engaged in combat with enemy unit |
| `dead` | Died in combat, on 4-hour cooldown |
| `cooldown` | Same as dead, waiting for respawn |
| `unspawned` | Never placed on map (new unit) |

---

## Movement

Units move tile-by-tile at their speed stat.

**Movement Rules:**
- Cannot command a moving unit (wait until it arrives)
- Units take the shortest path to target
- Movement continues even if you're offline
- Units stop when reaching target or entering combat

**Example:**
A Crab (3s/tile) moving from (10, 10) to (0, 0) travels ~14 tiles diagonally, taking ~42 seconds.

---

## Combat

Combat occurs when two enemy units occupy the same tile in Z1-Z4.

### Combat Rules

1. Both units deal damage to each other every second
2. Damage = Unit's power stat (modified by Fury)
3. Combat continues until one unit dies (HP ≤ 0)
4. The survivor stays on the tile
5. Dead unit goes on **4-hour cooldown** before respawn

### Combat Math

**Example:** Crab (100 HP, 8 Power) vs Mantis (30 HP, 20 Power)

- Turn 1: Crab takes 20 damage (80 HP left), Mantis takes 8 damage (22 HP left)
- Turn 2: Crab takes 20 damage (60 HP left), Mantis takes 8 damage (14 HP left)
- Turn 3: Crab takes 20 damage (40 HP left), Mantis takes 8 damage (6 HP left)
- Turn 4: Crab takes 20 damage (20 HP left), Mantis takes 8 damage (0 HP - DEAD!)

**Winner:** Crab survives with 20 HP

### Combat Tips

- **Molt** high-value units before combat (+50% HP per molt)
- **Fury** units you're sending into combat (+100% damage)
- **Heal** damaged units that survived combat
- Mantis kills fast but dies faster - use ambush tactics
- Octopus should avoid combat entirely

---

## Territory Control

Each unit controls tiles in a radius around it based on its Zone stat.

### Territory Rules

1. Unit controls all tiles within its zone radius
2. If multiple friendly units overlap, tiles count once
3. If enemy units overlap, the tile is **contested** (no one scores)
4. Tiles are counted every hour for scoring snapshots

### Territory Examples

**Shrimp (Zone 2):** Controls a 5x5 area (diameter = 2*2+1)
**Crab (Zone 3):** Controls a 7x7 area
**Octopus (Zone 5):** Controls an 11x11 area!

---

## Scoring & Game Fund

### How Scoring Works

1. **Hourly Snapshots**: Every hour, the game counts each player's controlled tiles
2. **Zone-Based Allocation**: Each zone receives a fixed percentage of the daily distribution pool
   - Z4 (Core) = 10% of daily pool
   - Z3 (Inner Ring) = 40% of daily pool
   - Z2 (Mid Ring) = 30% of daily pool
   - Z1 (Outer Ring) = 20% of daily pool
   - Z0 (Spawn Zone) = 0%
3. **Daily Average**: 24 hourly snapshots are averaged
4. **Distribution**: Once per day, 1/90th of the Game Fund is distributed. Players in each zone split that zone's allocation proportionally by tiles held

### Game Fund

The Game Fund grows from:
- Molt Pack purchases
- heal/molt/fury purchases
- bomb/nuke purchases

**Distribution starts** when fund reaches 20,000 USDC
**Distribution pauses** if fund drops below 10,000 USDC

### Earning USDC

Your daily USDC = Sum of each zone's reward, where per-zone reward = (Your tiles in zone ÷ Total tiles in zone) × Zone allocation × (Fund × 1/90)

**Example:**
- Fund: 90,000 USDC
- Daily distribution: 1,000 USDC
- Your score: 500 points
- Total all scores: 10,000 points
- Your share: (500/10000) × 1000 = **50 USDC**

---

## Upgrades

### Molt (5 USDC)

- Adds +50% to unit's **base HP**
- Max 3 molts per spawn cycle
- Effect resets if unit dies

**Example:** Crab (100 base HP)
- After 1 molt: 150 HP
- After 2 molts: 200 HP
- After 3 molts: 250 HP

### Fury (15 USDC)

- Adds +100% to unit's **base Power**
- Max 3 fury applications per spawn cycle
- Effect resets if unit dies

**Example:** Crab (10 base Power)
- After 1 fury: 20 Power
- After 2 fury: 30 Power
- After 3 fury: 40 Power

### Heal (3 USDC)

- Restores unit to 100% of its **current max HP**
- Use after combat to restore damaged units
- Does not increase max HP

### Jump (0.001 USDC)

- Instantly teleport unit to target coordinates
- Bypasses movement time completely
- Triggers combat if enemy unit is at destination
- Great for surprise attacks or quick repositioning
- Very cheap - use strategically for ambushes!

---

## Weapons

### Bomb (299 USDC)

- Destroys ALL units in a 5x5 radius around target coordinates
- Affects both enemy AND your own units!
- Great for clearing contested areas

### Nuke (999 USDC)

- Destroys ALL units on the ENTIRE map
- Total reset - everyone starts from Z0 again
- Nuclear option for desperate situations

---

## Strategies

### Early Game (1-3 units)

1. Use `start` with an invite code for bonus unit
2. Move units from Z0 into Z1 for scoring
3. Avoid other players - you can't fight yet
4. Scout the map to find empty territory

### Mid Game (4-10 units)

1. Buy Molt Packs to build your army
2. Spread units across different areas
3. Molt your tankiest units (Hermit, Crab)
4. Start pushing into Z2 for 1.5x scoring
5. Avoid Z3/Z4 until you're stronger

### Late Game (10+ units)

1. Push toward the Core with your best units
2. Use Fury before combat encounters
3. Position Octopus in safe areas for territory
4. Keep Mantis ready for counter-attacks
5. Control multiple zones for stable income

### Combat Strategies

**Aggressive:**
- Fury your strongest unit
- Move directly at enemy units
- Accept losses to eliminate threats

**Defensive:**
- Molt all units for survivability
- Position in hard-to-reach areas
- Avoid direct confrontation

**Economic:**
- Focus Octopus in mid zones
- Avoid combat entirely
- Maximize territory per unit

**Nuclear:**
- Save USDC for bomb/nuke
- Wait for enemies to cluster
- Clear the board and rush center
