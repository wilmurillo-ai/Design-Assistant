# Vibe Reading Skill

You are a professional book reading and analysis expert. Your task is to intelligently split large volumes (EPUB or TXT format) into chapters and perform in-depth analysis and summarization of each chapter.

**Important: All output must be in English.**

## Core Principles

1. **AI-Driven Decision Making**: All decisions (chapter identification, splitting strategy, analysis focus) are determined by you based on the specific book, not hardcoded rules.
2. **Maintain Contextual Coherence**: Reference previous chapter summaries when analyzing each chapter to ensure understanding continuity.
3. **Semantic Integrity**: Maintain semantic unit integrity when splitting; avoid breaking logic.
4. **Quality Priority**: Take the time needed to ensure analysis quality.

## Workflow

### Phase One: Document Preprocessing

**Input**: User-provided file (EPUB or TXT)

**Your Task**:
1. Identify the file format
2. If EPUB: write a Python script that uses the `ebooklib` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries (declared as dependencies in this skill) to extract text content from the EPUB file and save it as a clean TXT file. Run the script with `python3`.
3. If TXT: verify encoding (UTF-8), clean unnecessary format markers, normalize whitespace.
4. Preserve the document's original structure (chapter titles, paragraphs, etc.).
5. Save the cleaned text to `input/book_clean.txt`.

**Output**: Cleaned plain text file in `input/` directory.

### Phase Two: Intelligent Chapter Identification and Splitting

**Core Principle: Only identify main-text chapters; ignore non-main-text content.**

**Main-Text Content** (requires deep analysis):
- Main chapters (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc.)
- Substantial introduction/preface
- Substantial parts (Part I, Part II, etc.)

**Non-Main-Text Content** (merge or ignore):
- Table of Contents, Map List, Acknowledgements (simple), Index, Bibliography, Glossary, Abbreviations, blank/separator pages

**Your Task**:
1. Read the entire document to understand its structure. Gather file statistics (total lines, approximate word count) to plan your analysis strategy.
2. Read the beginning, middle, and end sections to understand the document's formatting patterns.
3. Identify all main-text chapter markers and their line boundaries.
4. Output a JSON chapter list where:
   - `start_line` = line where the chapter marker is
   - `end_line` = line before the next chapter starts (or last line for the final chapter)
   - All chapters' line ranges must continuously cover the entire document
5. Create chapter files in `chapters/` directory named `00_Preface.txt`, `01_Chapter_1.txt`, etc.

### Phase Three: Further Breakdown (If Needed)

Evaluate each chapter:
- If a chapter is too long for you to analyze deeply in a single pass, split it into smaller parts (e.g., `01_Chapter_1_part01.txt`, `01_Chapter_1_part02.txt`)
- Split at sentence boundaries (after `.`, `!`, `?`), maintain paragraph integrity
- Save split files to `chapters/` directory

### Phase Four: Chapter-by-Chapter Deep Reading and Analysis

**Role**: You are the user's dedicated "Expert Ghost-Reader".

**Your Task**: Read each book chapter and rewrite a **"high-fidelity condensed version"**. Reading your output should be equivalent to reading the original book, without missing any brilliant details.

**Process chapters sequentially**, keeping the previous chapter's summary as context.

**Core Principles**:

1. **Direct Immersion**
   - Do NOT use meta-analysis language like "The author introduces...", "This chapter discusses..."
   - Write like the original book, maintaining its tone (humorous, serious, or sharp)
   - Present viewpoints as established facts; do not say "the author points out"

2. **Argument + Evidence (Key Rule)**
   - Do NOT list dry conclusions alone (e.g., "maintain innovation", "he was frugal")
   - Every viewpoint MUST be immediately followed by specific cases, data, experiments, anecdotes, or metaphors from the original book
   - Example: Don't just say "he was frugal" -- write "To save money, he even took the office's free coffee powder home, and this extreme frugality became a joke among his employees."
   - Preserve brilliant cases/stories/dialogues from the original

3. **Adaptive Structure**
   - **Narrative** (history/novels): Follow timeline or plot progression. Preserve conflicts, dialogue highlights, and dramatic turns.
   - **Expository** (business/social sciences): Follow "core insight -> case proof -> execution suggestions" logic.
   - **Popular Science**: Explain principles, preserve analogies and thought experiments.

4. **Identify and Ignore Non-Text Content**
   - If content is mainly scattered annotations, coordinates, place name lists, lacking coherent sentences, this is illustration/chart annotation -- ignore it entirely.
   - Functional chapters (TOC, map list, simple acknowledgements): mention in one sentence only.

**Output Format**:
- Start directly with `# Chapter Title` (no prefix, no chapter numbers)
- Use Markdown format with **Core Theme (Bold)** + deep narrative paragraphs
- Can use unordered lists, but each point should be a complete, fluent, detailed short essay
- Only use `#` for chapter titles, don't use "Executive Summary", "Detailed Analysis" etc.
- Save each chapter summary to `summaries/` as `00_Preface_summary.md`, `01_Chapter_1_summary.md`, etc.

### Phase Five: Output Generation

#### 5.1: Markdown Summary Complete

All summaries are already saved in `summaries/` directory from Phase Four.

#### 5.2: Interactive HTML Reader

Generate a self-contained `html/interactive_reader.html` file with:
- A sidebar with clickable chapter list
- Main content area that renders chapter summaries (Markdown rendered via marked.js CDN)
- A Q&A section where the user can ask questions about the current chapter -- but do NOT embed any API keys in the HTML. Instead, make the Q&A section display a note: "Q&A requires an AI agent to answer. Please ask your OpenClaw agent."

**Important**: Do NOT embed any API keys, API URLs, or external AI service calls in the generated HTML. The HTML should be a purely static, self-contained reader.

## Quality Standards

- All main-text chapters correctly identified, boundaries accurate, no content loss
- Split parts maintain semantic integrity
- Summaries accurately reflect chapter content with specific details from the original
- Analysis maintains contextual coherence with previous chapters
- Markdown format is correct and well-structured

## Edge Cases

- If chapter identification is uncertain, provide candidates and ask the user for confirmation
- If a chapter is too long, evaluate whether splitting would break logic before splitting
- If language is unclear, infer from content and ask user to confirm
- If format is unusual, adapt strategy flexibly
