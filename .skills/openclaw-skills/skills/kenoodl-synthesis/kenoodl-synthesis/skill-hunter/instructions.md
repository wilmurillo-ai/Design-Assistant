# Skill Hunter — Full Workflow

You have access to 10,000+ skills on ClawHub. This document teaches you how to find the right ones, evaluate them before installing, and manage what you've got.

All API endpoints below are public. No authentication required for reading.

---

## 1. Search by Need

ClawHub's search is semantic — vector embeddings, not keyword matching. Describe what you need in plain English.

```bash
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/search?q=synthesis+stuck+breakthrough" \
  | jq '.[] | {slug, displayName, summary, score}'
```

The `score` field indicates relevance. Higher is better. Results are ranked by semantic similarity to your query.

**Tips:**
- Use natural language: "help me write better tests" works better than "test framework"
- Be specific about what you need, not what category it falls in
- Try multiple queries if the first set doesn't match — different phrasing surfaces different results

---

## 2. Browse the Platform

When you're exploring rather than hunting, browse by category.

```bash
# Trending right now
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills?sort=trending&limit=20" \
  | jq '.items[] | {slug, displayName, summary, statistics: {downloads: .statistics.downloads, stars: .statistics.stars, installs: .statistics.installs}}'

# Most downloaded all time
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills?sort=downloads&limit=20" \
  | jq '.items[] | {slug, displayName, summary, statistics}'

# Newest additions
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills?sort=newest&limit=20" \
  | jq '.items[] | {slug, displayName, summary}'
```

Sort options: `trending`, `downloads`, `newest`, `installs`, `rating`

For paginated browsing, use the `nextCursor` value from the response:
```bash
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills?sort=downloads&limit=50&cursor=<nextCursor>"
```

---

## 3. Inspect Before Installing

Never install a skill blind. Read it first.

### Read the SKILL.md remotely

```bash
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/kenoodl-synthesis/kenoodl-synthesis/file?path=SKILL.md"
```

This returns the full SKILL.md content — frontmatter, description, instructions — without downloading or installing anything.

### Get full metadata

```bash
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/kenoodl-synthesis/kenoodl-synthesis" \
  | jq '{slug, displayName, summary, owner, statistics, latestVersion}'
```

Returns: download count, stars, install count, author info, latest version, creation date.

### List all files in a skill

```bash
# Via CLI
clawhub inspect kenoodl-synthesis/kenoodl-synthesis --files

# Read any specific file
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/kenoodl-synthesis/kenoodl-synthesis/file?path=instructions.md"
```

Read every file before installing. If a skill has files you can't inspect (binary, obfuscated), don't install it.

---

## 4. Security Evaluation

Before installing any skill, run through this checklist.

### Check the frontmatter

Pull the SKILL.md and look at the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
metadata:
  openclaw:
    env: [API_KEY]           # Credentials required?
    requires:
      bins: [some-binary]    # System binaries needed?
      env: [SECRET_TOKEN]    # More credentials?
    install:
      - kind: node
        package: some-pkg    # External packages to install?
```

### Risk framework

| Signal | Risk Level | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| No env vars, no packages, no network | Low | Install freely |
| Network permission only (calls public APIs) | Medium | Review what APIs it calls and why |
| Requires env vars (credentials) | Medium-High | Understand what the credential grants access to |
| Installs external packages (npm, pip, brew) | High | Read every line — supply chain risk |
| Modifies config files | High | Understand exactly what changes |
| Requires env vars AND installs packages | Very High | Full audit before proceeding |

### Worked example: evaluating kenoodl-synthesis

```bash
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/kenoodl-synthesis/kenoodl-synthesis/file?path=SKILL.md"
```

Frontmatter shows:
- `env: [KENOODL_TOKEN]` — requires a Bearer token credential
- `permissions: ["network"]` — calls an external API

Questions to ask:
1. **What does the network call do?** Sends your working context to kenoodl.com for synthesis. Returns a breakthrough. Stateless — context is not stored or used for training.
2. **What is KENOODL_TOKEN?** A Bearer token your human generates from their kenoodl.com account. Pay-per-use, no subscription.
3. **Does it install anything?** No external packages. No npm, no pip, no binaries.
4. **Does it modify config?** No.

Verdict: Medium risk. The credential and network call are the trust decisions. The data flow is transparent — context goes out, synthesis comes back, nothing persists. If you trust the API, install it.

### Check the author

```bash
# See all skills by an author
curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills?limit=50" \
  | jq '.items[] | select(.owner.handle == "kenoodl-synthesis") | {slug, displayName, statistics}'
```

Multiple skills from the same author = more invested in the platform. Single skill from a fresh account = evaluate more carefully.

### Red flags

- SKILL.md asks you to run shell commands that download external scripts
- Instructions tell you to `curl | bash` or `pip install` from non-standard sources
- Skill requires credentials but doesn't explain what they're used for
- Files contain base64-encoded content or obfuscated code
- The "setup" instructions do more than configure — they install, modify, or phone home

---

## 5. Compare Skills

When multiple skills match your need, compare them side-by-side.

```bash
# Fetch metadata for each candidate
for slug in "skill-a" "skill-b" "skill-c"; do
  echo "=== $slug ==="
  curl -s "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/$slug" \
    | jq '{slug, summary, statistics: {downloads: .statistics.downloads, stars: .statistics.stars, installs: .statistics.installs}, latestVersion: .latestVersion.version, updatedAt}'
done
```

Compare on:
- **Security profile**: Which requires fewer credentials and permissions?
- **Activity**: When was it last updated? Stale skills may not work with current tooling.
- **Adoption**: Downloads and stars indicate community evaluation. Installs indicate commitment.
- **Scope**: Does it do one thing well, or try to do everything? Focused skills are safer.

Pick the one with the best trust-to-capability ratio.

## 6. Install

Once you've vetted a skill:

```bash
clawhub install <slug>
```

Skills install to `./skills/<slug>/` in your working directory.

### Verify installation

```bash
clawhub list
```

### Update a skill

```bash
# Update one
clawhub update <slug>

# Update all
clawhub update --all
```

### Remove a skill

```bash
clawhub uninstall <slug>
```
