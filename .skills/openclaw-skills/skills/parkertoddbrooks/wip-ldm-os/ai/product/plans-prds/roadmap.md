# LDM OS ... Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-03-20
**Current version:** v0.4.37

Items are either **Upcoming**, **Done**, or **Deprecated**. Never delete. Always move.

## Vision

Every AI you use shares one infrastructure. Identity, memory, tools, communication. Install once, works everywhere. Your data stays on your machine. The agents coordinate without you in the middle.

---

## Upcoming

### Priority 1 ... Shared Agent Awareness

Every agent and session knows what everyone else is doing in real time. Prevents duplicate work, eliminates Parker as relay.

- [ ] shared-log.jsonl (append-only event log)
- [ ] Boot hook reads shared log ("while you were away")
- [ ] Stop hook writes to shared log
- [ ] Cross-write to Lesa's daily log
- [ ] Lesa reads shared log on heartbeat

Plan: `current/2026-03-17--shared-awareness-and-coordination.md`

### Priority 2 ... Bidirectional Agent Communication (Phase 1)

CC and Lesa talk in real time. ACP WebSocket replaces HTTP inbox.

- [ ] CC MCP server connects to gateway via ACP
- [ ] Lesa pushes messages to CC instantly
- [ ] Kill HTTP inbox (port 18790)
- [ ] Update lesa_send_message to use ACP

Plan: `current/bidirectional-agent-communication.md`

### Priority 3 ... Dry-Run Summary Table Polish

`ldm install --dry-run` shows CLI version, extension summary, major bumps, agents, health issues. Built in v0.4.18. Needs polish and the dry-run health check (#80).

Plan: `upcoming/2026-03-17--dry-run-summary-table.md`

### Priority 4 ... Repo-Based Install (Participation Layer)

`ldm install` clones repos permanently to ~/.ldm/repos/. Agents work in them, submit bugs and PRs back to upstream. Transforms the installer into a contribution loop.

- [ ] ~/.ldm/repos/ as permanent repo home
- [ ] ai/ folder scaffold on install
- [ ] ldm bug command
- [ ] ldm contribute command
- [ ] Change detection in ldm status

Plan: `upcoming/2026-03-17--repo-based-install-participation-layer.md`

### Priority 5 ... Public Launch

Connect all products. Website, install pages, GitHub org profile. First external users.

- [ ] Fresh install test on clean macOS
- [ ] Crystal Core/Node multi-device test (Air laptop)
- [ ] Test matrix per release (#89)
- [ ] Entity formation (Stripe Atlas)

Plan: `current/ldm-os-public-launch-plan.md`

### Priority 6 ... Release Guard Exemptions

`ldm install`, `ldm doctor`, `gh` commands should be exempt from the release guard. Currently blocks dogfooding (#95).

### Priority 7 ... Test Matrix

Every release gets a testable checklist. Automated from git diff (#89).

- [ ] Master test matrix in ai/product/testing/
- [ ] Per-release template
- [ ] wip-release auto-generates test template

## Deprecated

- ~~Universal Installer as standalone package~~ ... absorbed into LDM OS. `ldm install` is the command. (2026-03-17)
- ~~npm bin fix (#32)~~ ... worked around with self-update + health check. The underlying npm bug persists but the user never sees it. (2026-03-17)
