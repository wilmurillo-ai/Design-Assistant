# agent-travel

The second law of thermodynamics says a closed system drifts toward entropy. Agents do too. An agent that stays trapped inside the same tools, the same context window, and the same stale assumptions will slowly confuse repetition with truth. `agent-travel` gives it a low-noise micro-travel loop: step out only during heartbeat, task wrap-up, failure recovery, scheduled windows, or idle fallback, then bring back what is still useful for the current problem.

It is not a noisy background crawler and it does not make decisions for the user. It compresses outside practice into advisory-only hints, stores them in an isolated channel, and surfaces them only when the next relevant task appears.

## Current Scope

This repository currently ships the protocol layer, trigger gate, output contract, validator, and host adapters. Real search execution, query redaction, maturity scoring, and candidate ranking still belong to the host agent or a later integration layer.

## Why It Is Lightweight

- No daemon. Scheduling stays with the host agent through heartbeat, cron, task-end, or failure hooks.
- No database. State stays in a lightweight `state.json`, and hints stay in an isolated `suggestions.md`.
- Public search surfaces are the default. Internal docs, private connectors, and private repos require explicit user opt-in.
- Every script uses Python stdlib only.
- Search is executed by the host tools. This repository defines triggers, contracts, validation, and host adapters.
- The suggestion channel stays isolated. It does not write into the core system prompt, persona, long-term memory, or core AGENT.md/agent.md instructions.
- Implicit invocation is off by default. Background runs should be wired explicitly through the host's heartbeat, cron, or task-end configuration.

## Scan Note

Some static scans will pay extra attention to the hostile-payload categories inside [references/threat-model.md](references/threat-model.md). They are defensive labels that show what the host should reject, not instructions that the skill should execute.

## Recommended Default

The recommended default is low-frequency, small-scope, and silent by design.

- `active_conversation_window = 24h`
- `default_search_mode = low`
- `tool_preference = public-only`
- `quiet_after_user_action = 20m`
- `quiet_after_agent_action = 5m`
- `repeat_fingerprint_cooldown = 12h`
- `max_runs_per_thread_per_day = 1`
- `max_runs_per_user_per_day = 3`
- `visibility = silent_until_relevant`

`medium` and `high` are escalation modes, not the everyday background default.

`idle_fallback` fits hosts without heartbeat, or hosts where the operator explicitly enabled it. Heartbeat stays the default background path when available.
For cron or scheduled travel, host-generated prompts should stay neutral and fact-derived from logs, backlog deltas, docs drift, or collected materials. Manually created scheduled prompts may preserve the operator's original wording.

## Key Points

- Search uses three tiers: `primary` for official docs, release notes, and official discussions; `secondary` for search engines, GitHub issues, and Stack Overflow; `tertiary` for forums, blogs, and social media.
- Every suggestion is cross-validated. At least 1 `primary` evidence item is mandatory, plus 1 non-`primary` cross-validation evidence item.
- Every kept suggestion must include `match_reasoning`, with axis-by-axis notes explaining why it matched at least 4 of the 5 axes.
- Output is always advisory-only and scoped to `active_conversation_only`.
- The host should invoke it only inside a quiet window: no user operation, no agent output in progress, and no pending tool approval.

## Do Not Use This For

- Autonomous command execution from web pages.
- Private-data search without explicit user opt-in.
- Permanent memory, persona, or core-instruction mutation.
- Replacing user decisions.

## Companion Skill

`agent-travel` is the single-node background research layer today. It pairs with the same author's [agent-compute-mesh](https://github.com/gongyu0918-debug/agent-compute-mesh): this skill compresses outside practice into structured hints, while the mesh skill turns similar `exploration job` units into stricter execution leases.

## Community Workflow Fixtures

This version ships with 14 real-source workflow fixtures that cover Claude Code task-end refresh, failure recovery, scheduled log collection, scheduled job health audits, manual scheduled `CLAUDE.md` refresh, weekly reference-sheet refresh, OpenClaw heartbeat advisory isolation, cron research digests, daily summary collection, idle-fallback silence guards, plus Hermes scheduled doc-drift scans, nightly backlog triage, and repeated-fingerprint dedupe. The scenarios and source links live in [references/community-workflows.md](references/community-workflows.md), and the smoke results live in [assets/community_smoke_report.json](assets/community_smoke_report.json).
