# MTV Rewind

Stream classic MTV music videos — 80s, 90s, 2000s — right inside your chat. 90,000+ videos, zero ads, zero algorithms.

**Player:** https://wantmymtv.xyz/player.html

## Installation

No API keys, no binaries, no configuration required.

**Install via ClawHub CLI:**

```bash
clawhub install @Flexasaurusrex/mtv-rewind
```

**Or install globally** (available to all your agents):

```bash
clawhub install @Flexasaurusrex/mtv-rewind --global
```

Once installed, the skill is added to your `./skills` directory and is active immediately.

> **Note:** This skill works entirely by directing users to `https://wantmymtv.xyz/player.html`. No credentials, environment variables, or additional configuration are needed now or in future versions. If an update ever asks for API keys or system access, treat that as suspicious.

## When to Use

- "Play MTV"
- "I want my MTV"
- "Put on some music videos"
- "What's on MTV?"
- "Play 80s / 90s / 2000s music videos"
- "I need background vibes"
- Any request for retro music video content

## When NOT to Use

- User wants a specific song (use a music search skill)
- User wants audio only (use a music player skill)
- User wants a specific current chart hit or brand-new release (coverage is strongest for 80s–2010s)

## How to Respond

### Telegram (with Web App support)

If your agent has access to the `message` tool with inline button support, send a message with a `web_app` button to open the player natively inside Telegram:

```json
{
  "channel": "telegram",
  "action": "send",
  "to": "<chat_id>",
  "message": "MTV Rewind is on. All eras, no commercials, no skips. Just vibes.",
  "buttons": [[{"text": "📺 Watch MTV Rewind", "web_app": {"url": "https://wantmymtv.xyz/player.html"}}]]
}
```

After sending via the message tool, respond with your platform's silent reply token to avoid duplicate messages.

### All Platforms (fallback)

Include the player URL directly in your response:

```
MTV Rewind is on. All eras, no commercials, no skips. Just vibes.

📺 https://wantmymtv.xyz/player.html
```

## Tone

Keep it short, nostalgic, and a little smug — like someone with impeccable taste in music. Don't over-explain. Drop the link and let the music speak.

Good:
- "You have taste. Here."
- "Serving visuals. You're welcome."
- "The algorithm could never."

Bad:
- "Sure! Here's a link to watch MTV Rewind music videos from the retro era!"
- "I've found a music video streaming service for you!"
