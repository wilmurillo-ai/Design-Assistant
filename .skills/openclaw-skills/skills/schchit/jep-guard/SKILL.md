# JEP Guard

Add responsibility layer to Clawbot - intercept high-risk commands, log actions, and optionally generate verifiable JEP receipts.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT PRIVACY NOTICE

**JEP Guard logs commands to `~/.jep-guard-audit.log`**

### Log Levels

| Level | What gets logged | Risk |
|-------|------------------|------|
| `minimal` **(default)** | Command names only | ✅ Safe |
| `normal` | Commands + redacted arguments | ⚠️ Medium |
| `verbose` | Full command lines | ❌ High |

**Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys) may be logged if you:**
- Set log level to `verbose`
- Use commands with sensitive arguments

**You are responsible for:** Reviewing logs regularly and choosing appropriate log level.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

**Optional:** `@jep-eth/sdk` for real JEP signatures
- Without it: Receipts are **not generated**
- Install: `npm install -g @jep-eth/sdk`
- Generate keys: `claw run jep-guard keygen` (requires SDK)

---

## ✨ Features

- **🛡️ High-risk command interception** - Blocks `rm`, `mv`, `cp` before execution
- **✅ User confirmation dialog** - Prompts for approval before allowing risky operations
- **🔐 Temporary authorization tokens** - 5-minute expiry tokens for approved commands
- **📝 Audit logging** - Records all actions with timestamps
- **🔑 Optional JEP receipts** - Cryptographically verifiable proofs (requires SDK + your key)
- **📤 Export functionality** - Export audit logs as JSON

---

## 📥 Installation

```bash
claw install jep-guard
```

During installation, you will see a privacy warning. Read it carefully before proceeding.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. View current configuration
claw run jep-guard config

# 2. (Optional) Generate JEP keys for signed receipts
claw run jep-guard keygen

# 3. Test protection
rm test.txt
# JEP Guard will ask for confirmation

# 4. Export audit logs
claw run jep-guard export
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

```bash
# Show current settings
claw run jep-guard config

# Change log level
claw run jep-guard config set logLevel minimal   # Safe (default)
claw run jep-guard config set logLevel normal    # Redacted args
claw run jep-guard config set logLevel verbose   # Full args (caution!)

# View recent logs
claw run jep-guard config show
```

## 🔐 JEP Signing

JEP Guard **never uses placeholder or default keys**. Receipts are only generated if you:

1. Install JEP SDK: `npm install -g @jep-eth/sdk`
2. Generate your own key pair: `claw run jep-guard keygen`
3. Your private key is stored in `~/.jep-guard-config.json`

**Without a valid private key, no receipts are generated.**

### ⚠️ Private Key Security
- Your private key is stored **in plain text** in `~/.jep-guard-config.json`
- Treat this file as highly sensitive
- Back up securely if needed
- The file is deleted during uninstall (if you choose)

---

## 📤 Export Logs

```bash
claw run jep-guard export
```

Exports audit logs as JSON with redaction based on your current log level setting.

**Export includes:**
- All logged commands with timestamps
- User information
- JEP receipt hashes (if generated)
- Privacy redaction applied according to log level

---

## 🗑️ Uninstall

```bash
claw uninstall jep-guard
```

During uninstall, you will be asked:
- Keep audit logs? (files remain)
- Delete audit logs? (files removed)

Configuration file (containing private key) is **always deleted** on uninstall.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Private key storage:** Keys are stored unencrypted in config file
- **JEP SDK required:** Receipt generation needs separate SDK installation
- **No network features:** All processing is local
- **Sensitive data risk:** Verbose logging may capture passwords/tokens
- **Documentation:** All features listed here are implemented (no exaggerated claims)
