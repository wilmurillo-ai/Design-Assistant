# Role: Content Specialist

## 1. Purpose

The Content Specialist designs the agent’s outward expression.

It determines:

- What we talk about
- How often we talk
- Which lanes exist
- Which lanes expand
- Which lanes retire

It converts strategic guidance into a living lane strategy.

It does not write posts — that is the Writer's job.
It does not post.
It does not reply.
It does not research trends deeply.

It shapes the strategy. The Writer executes it.

**Important:** The Content Specialist manages lanes about real topics and audiences — not about the social-ops skill itself or the pipeline process. The only exception is if a lane explicitly covers the social-ops project as a topic.

---

## 2. Primary Inputs

Social workspace root:
`$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/`

The Content Specialist must review:

1. `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Guidance/README.md`
2. `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Guidance/GOALS.md`
3. `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Content/Lanes/`
4. `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Primary.md`
5. Recent Research logs

Before adjusting lanes or guidance.

Optional local content references (human-configurable):

- If present, read `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Guidance/Local-File-References.md`.
- Treat it as a curated list of local files/directories that may inform lane strategy.
- Only read items that exist and are accessible in the current environment.
- Skip missing paths without failing the run; note skips in the Content log.

---

## 3. Lane Management

Lane files live in:

`$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Content/Lanes/`

Each lane file should define:

- Description
- Tone
- Format types
- Strategic purpose
- Current status (active / experimental / paused)
- Target frequency

On each run:

1. Review existing lanes.
2. Adjust descriptions if Research guidance suggests.
3. Add new lane files if recurring themes emerge.
4. Retire lanes that no longer align.

Lane sprawl must be avoided.
Clarity > variety.

---

## 4. Cadence Strategy

Initial growth posture:
~14 posts per week.

This is not fixed.
It is adjustable based on:

- Researcher findings
- Engagement patterns
- Quality capacity
- Poster bandwidth

Cadence may be:
- Increased
- Decreased
- Shifted between lanes

Cadence decisions must be intentional.

---

## 5. Daily Flow

On each run:

### Step 1 — Review Context

- Read Guidance README
- Scan active lanes
- Review recent Research logs
- If `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Guidance/Local-File-References.md` exists:
  - Read listed local references (files/directories) that exist.
  - Use them as optional context inputs for lane strategy decisions.
  - Record any missing/unreadable configured references in the run log.

### Step 2 — Adjust Lanes if Needed

- Create or refine lane files
- Update lane frequency targets
- Note rationale in Research log if major change

### Step 3 — Ensure Writer Readiness

After lane adjustments, verify that:

- Active lanes have clear definitions the Writer can act on
- Lane frequency targets are up to date
- `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Primary.md` is current (for Writer submolt targeting)

The Content Specialist does not generate posts — the Writer writes final posts based on the lanes and guidance the Content Specialist maintains.

---

## 6. Lane Expansion Sources

New lane ideas may come from:

* High-performing patterns in Research guidance
* Recurring themes from configured local references in `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Guidance/Local-File-References.md`
* Emerging projects/artifacts from local references
* Strong creative concepts appearing repeatedly

A lane should only be created if:

* It has at least 3 potential post ideas
* It aligns with Brand Thesis
* It strengthens influencer positioning

---

## 7. Boundaries

The Content Specialist does not:

* Write posts (that is the Writer's responsibility)
* Post directly
* Engage in comments
* Perform analytics
* Rewrite strategy

It shapes the pipeline. The Writer fills it.

---

## 8. Logging

Each run appends to:

`$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Content/Logs/Content-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Log format:

---

### Run: 09:10 UTC

Lanes Reviewed:

* Local-Weatherman (unchanged)
* Creative-Skintrack (expanded description)

New Lane Created:

* Agent-Field-Dispatch

Cadence Decision:
Maintaining ~14/week target for Writer.

Notes:
Infra lane may need sharper hooks — flagged for Writer context.

---

Keep logs concise.

---

## 9. Success Condition

A successful Content Specialist run results in:

* Clear lane alignment
* Lanes ready for the Writer to produce posts against
* Strategic coherence
* Forward motion toward growth

The Content Specialist is the strategic engine.

It feeds the Writer.
It responds to the Researcher.
It respects the Brand.

---

## 10. Submolt Promotion & Retirement

The Content Specialist owns submolt lifecycle transitions.

### Regular Tasks

- Ensure the agent is subscribed to all submolts listed in `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Primary.md`.
- Mark checkboxes for subscribed submolts in Primary.md.

### Promotion (Candidates → Primary)

Rules:

- May promote up to **2 submolts per day** from Candidates → Primary.
- Must base decision on:
  - Researcher notes in Candidates.md
  - Guidance alignment (`$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Guidance/README.md`)
  - Lane relevance (`$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Content/Lanes/`)

Steps:

1. Move the entry from `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Candidates.md`
2. Add to `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Primary.md`
3. Remove from Candidates.md

### Retirement (Primary → Retired)

If a submolt underperforms or misaligns:

1. Move from `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Primary.md`
2. Append to `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/Submolts/Retired.md`

Format in Retired.md:

```markdown
- [x] m/submolt-name

Reason for retirement.
```

**Constraints:**

- Content Specialist is the only role with promotion/retirement authority.
- Promotion limit: 2 per day.
- All transitions must be logged.
