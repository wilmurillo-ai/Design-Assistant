  Role-based social media operations skill. Use this skill when executing
  structured social campaigns — scouting opportunities, crafting content,
  posting, responding to threads, and analyzing performance. Designed for
  Moltbook engagement but adaptable to any platform and persona. Separates execution into six composable roles (Scout, Researcher,
  Content Specialist, Responder, Poster, Analyst) so each run stays focused
  and auditable. Activate this skill for any social ops task: opportunity
  detection, content pipeline management, community engagement, or
  performance review.

# Social Ops

Execute social media operations through specialized roles. Each role has a
single responsibility, reads its own reference doc, and hands off to the next
stage in the pipeline.

NOTE: Utilize the moltbook skill as necessary to meet these goals.

## Workflow

```
Scout ──→ Content Specialist  (new opportunities → lane strategy)
Scout ──→ Responder           (reply-worthy threads → responses)
Researcher ──→ guidance for Content Specialist & Writer
Content Specialist ──→ Writer (lanes → final posts)
Writer ──→ Poster             (finished posts → published)
Poster ──→ done logs          (published → archived)
Analyst ──→ strategy adjustments (performance data → tuning)
```

## Roles

When dispatched to a role, read its reference doc fully before acting.

| Role | Doc | Responsibility |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **Scout** | `{baseDir}/references/roles/Scout.md` | Monitor for emerging opportunities, trending threads, and new submolts. Detect openings — never act on them directly. |
| **Researcher** | `{baseDir}/references/roles/Researcher.md` | Deep-dive into topics, trends, and competitor activity. Produce guidance that informs content and responses. |
| **Content Specialist** | `{baseDir}/references/roles/Content-Specialist.md` | Convert intelligence and strategy into a content backlog. Define lanes, cadence, and messaging. Does not post. |
| **Responder** | `{baseDir}/references/roles/Responder.md` | Craft replies to threads surfaced by Scout. Match voice, add value, stay on-brand. |
| **Poster** | `{baseDir}/references/roles/Poster.md` | Publish finished posts to the platform. Move completed items to done logs. No ideation, no rewriting. |
| **Analyst** | `{baseDir}/references/roles/Analyst.md` | Measure performance, identify what compounds, recommend strategy adjustments. Runs weekly minimum. |

## Dispatching a Role

1. Identify which role the task requires.
2. Read the full role doc at `{baseDir}/references/roles/<Role>.md`.
3. Follow the role's instructions — stay within its scope.
4. Hand off outputs to the next role in the workflow.

## Strategy

The north-star strategy lives at `{baseDir}/assets/strategy/Social-Networking-Plan.md`.
Read it before any Content Specialist or Analyst run. It defines brand voice,
target audience, lane structure, and growth objectives.

## Role I/O Map

Role-to-role artifact flow and logging ownership are documented in:

- `{baseDir}/references/ROLE-IO-MAP.md`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR` | **Yes** | Absolute path to the `Social/` data directory where runtime artifacts live (logs, lanes, guidance, todo/done queues, submolts, memory). |

### Setup

Before any role can run, `SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR` must be set. If it is not set:

1. **Ask the operator** where their Social data directory lives.
2. Recommend they add it to their shell profile:

```bash
export SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR=/path/to/Social
```

All role docs reference `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/` as the root for runtime data. This replaces the previous `<workspace>/Social/` convention for reliability.

## Path Conventions

Use these path rules to keep the skill portable:

- Skill-owned files (docs, scripts, assets): use `{baseDir}/...`
- Runtime/social data files (logs, guidance, todo/done queues): use `$SOCIAL_OPS_DATA_DIR/...`
- Runtime state files that are not in the data dir (for example comment watermarks): use the documented state path `{baseDir}/../state/...` until state-location policy changes.

When adding new instructions, do not hardcode machine-specific absolute paths.

## Directory Contract

```
references/           Role and strategic references
  roles/              One doc per role (Scout, Researcher, etc.)
  tasks/              Task queue and templates
assets/               Imported strategy artifacts and static source material
  strategy/           North-star strategy documents
scripts/              Optional helper scripts and adapters
Guidance/             Human-defined configuration and goals
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Guidance/CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md](Guidance/CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md).

## Cron Job Creation Prompt

For setting up automated execution of social-media roles, see [references/crons/InstallCrons.md](references/crons/InstallCrons.md).

Use one of these paths:
- **Basic install:** run `./packaged-scripts/install-cron-jobs.sh` from this repo root.
- **Custom install/tuning:** use `scripts/install-cron-jobs.sh` and `references/crons/InstallCrons.md` as templates, preserving `{baseDir}` conventions and role boundaries.
