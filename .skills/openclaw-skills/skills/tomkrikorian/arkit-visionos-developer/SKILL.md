# ARKit visionOS Developer

## Description and Goals

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for implementing ARKit-powered features on visionOS. ARKit on visionOS uses `ARKitSession` with data providers to access world tracking, hand tracking, plane detection, scene reconstruction, and other spatial data, which can then be bridged into RealityKit content.

### Goals

- Enable developers to set up and manage ARKitSession on visionOS
- Guide proper authorization handling for ARKit data providers
- Help developers choose and configure appropriate data providers
- Support anchor processing and RealityKit integration
- Ensure proper lifecycle management of ARKit sessions

## What This Skill Should Do

When implementing ARKit features on visionOS, this skill should:

1. **Guide ARKitSession setup** - Help you create and manage long-lived ARKitSession instances
2. **Handle authorization** - Show how to request and check authorization for required data types
3. **Select data providers** - Help you choose the right providers (world tracking, hand tracking, plane detection, etc.)
4. **Process anchors** - Demonstrate how to consume anchor updates and map them to RealityKit entities
5. **Manage lifecycle** - Ensure proper session start/stop and task cancellation
6. **Bridge to RealityKit** - Show how to integrate ARKit anchors with RealityKit content

### Quick Start Workflow

1. Add `NSWorldSensingUsageDescription`, `NSHandsTrackingUsageDescription`, and `NSMainCameraUsageDescription` to `Info.plist` as needed for the providers you use.
2. Use the presentation style required by the selected providers. Some providers require immersive space, while others have more specific rules.
3. Create a long-lived `ARKitSession` and the data providers you need.
4. Request authorization for provider-required data types before running the session.
5. Run the session with your providers and observe `anchorUpdates` streams.
6. Map anchors to RealityKit entities and keep state in a model layer.
7. Observe `ARKitSession.events` for authorization changes and errors.
8. Stop the session and cancel tasks when leaving the immersive space.

## Information About the Skill

### Core Concepts

#### ARKitSession Lifecycle

- Keep a strong reference to the session; call `run(_:)` with providers, stop on teardown.
- Sessions stop automatically on deinit, so maintain references throughout the immersive experience.

#### Authorization

- Use `requestAuthorization(for:)` or `queryAuthorization(for:)` and handle denied states gracefully.
- Request authorization before running the session with providers that require it.

#### Data Providers

- Choose providers for world tracking, plane detection, scene reconstruction, and hand tracking based on the feature set.
- Providers expose `anchorUpdates` streams that you consume to process anchors.

#### Anchors and Updates

- Consume provider `anchorUpdates` and reconcile added, updated, and removed anchors.
- Normalize anchor IDs to your own state model for reliable entity updates.

#### RealityKit Bridge

- Use `ARKitAnchorComponent` to inspect backing ARKit data on entities when needed.
- Treat ARKit streams as authoritative and keep rendering logic in RealityKit.

### Implementation Patterns

- Prefer one session per immersive experience and reuse providers when possible.
- Normalize anchor IDs to your own state model for reliable entity updates.
- Treat ARKit streams as authoritative and keep rendering logic in RealityKit.

### Pitfalls and Checks

- In SwiftUI-first visionOS apps, prefer `RealityView` for presentation and `ARKitSession` for tracking data; use `ARView` only when you specifically need its UIKit/AppKit-style view APIs.
- Do not assume every ARKit provider has the same presentation requirements; check the provider-specific guidance before choosing Shared Space, a volumetric window, or an immersive space.
- Do not block the main actor while awaiting provider updates.
- Do not drop session references; ARKit stops sessions on deinit.
