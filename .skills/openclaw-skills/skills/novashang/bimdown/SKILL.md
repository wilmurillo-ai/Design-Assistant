# BimDown Agent Skill & Schema Rules

> **Your Mission:** A bridge between AI agents and building data. Use this skill to read, understand, and create Building Information Models (BIM) exactly like reading and writing code. It enables you to execute architectural design, model from drawings, perform quantity surveying, and conduct model reviews. Of course, just modeling your own house is also very interesting and fully supported.


## Setup / Prerequisites
Before executing any `bimdown` commands, ensure the CLI is installed globally.
> **SECURITY RULE**: You **MUST explicitly ask the user for permission** before running `npm install` autonomously.

```bash
npm install -g bimdown-cli
```

You are an AI Coder operating within a BimDown project environment.
BimDown is an open-source, AI-native building data format using CSV for semantics and SVG for geometry.

## Core Architecture & Base Concepts

- **Global Unit is METERS**: All coordinates, widths, and structural attributes in CSV/SVG MUST strictly use METERS. BimDown simulates real-world dimensions.
- **Computed Fields are READ-ONLY**: Any field marked with `computed: true` (or listed in `virtual_fields`) is automatically calculated by the CLI. **DO NOT** write these fields to CSV files. You can retrieve their values using `bimdown query`.
- **Dual Nature**: Properties live in `{name}.csv`. 2D geometry lives in a sibling `{name}.svg` file. The `id` fields across both must match perfectly.
- **SVG-derived virtual columns**: When you write geometry in SVG, the CLI automatically computes these fields for `bimdown query` — do NOT write them to CSV:
  - Line elements (wall, beam, pipe, etc.): `length`, `start_x`, `start_y`, `end_x`, `end_y`
  - Polygon elements (slab, roof, etc.): `area`, `perimeter`
  - All elements: `level_id` (inferred from folder name, e.g. `lv-1/` → `lv-1`)
- **Concrete Example of CSV+SVG Linked State**:
  > `lv-1/wall.csv` (note: NO `level_id` column — it is auto-inferred):
  > `id,thickness,material`
  > `w-1,0.2,concrete`
  >
  > `lv-1/wall.svg`:
  > `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 -10 10 10"> <g transform="scale(1,-1)"> <path id="w-1" d="M 0 0 L 10 0" stroke-width="0.2" /> </g> </svg>`
  >
  > After this, `bimdown query . "SELECT id, length, level_id FROM wall"` returns `w-1, 10.0, lv-1` — both `length` and `level_id` are computed automatically.

## Project Directory Structure

```
project/
  project_metadata.json        # project root marker (format version, name, units)
  global/                      # global-only files — MUST be here, NOT in lv-N/
    grid.csv
    level.csv
    mesh.csv
  lv-1/                        # per-level files
    wall.csv + wall.svg        # elements with geometry have paired CSV+SVG
    door.csv                   # hosted elements are CSV-only (parametric position on host wall)
    space.csv                  # spaces: CSV seed point + space.svg boundary (computed by build)
    ...
  lv-2/
    ...
```

**Key rules**:
- `level.csv`, `grid.csv`, `mesh.csv` MUST live in `global/`, never in `lv-N/` directories
- Per-level elements (wall, door, slab, space, etc.) go in `lv-N/` directories
- The folder name (e.g. `lv-1`) becomes the element's `level_id` — do NOT write `level_id` to CSV

## Recommended Workflow for Creating/Modifying Buildings

1. **Plan spatial layout first**: Before writing any files, reason through the spatial relationships — wall positions, room adjacencies, door/window placements. Sketch coordinates mentally or on paper.
2. **Write SVG geometry first**: Create the `.svg` files (walls, slabs, columns) with correct coordinates. Geometry determines everything else.
3. **Write CSV attributes second**: Create the `.csv` files with element properties (material, thickness, etc.). Remember: do NOT include computed fields like `level_id`, `length`, `area`.
4. **Render and visually verify**: Run `bimdown render <dir> -o render.png` and **view the PNG image** to confirm the layout is correct. Check that walls connect properly, rooms are enclosed, and doors/windows are in the right positions. **Save render outputs and any other non-BimDown files OUTSIDE the project directory** — the project directory must only contain BimDown CSV/SVG files, otherwise `build` will reject them.
5. **Build**: Run `bimdown build <dir>` to validate schema, check geometry, and compute space boundaries (generates `space.svg` from seed points).
6. **Iterate**: If the render or build shows problems, fix the SVG geometry and re-render until the layout looks right.
7. **Publish**: Run `bimdown publish <dir>` to upload and get a shareable 3D preview URL. Ask user for consent before the first publish of each project.

## Reference SOPs

Before starting any building design or modeling task, **always read the relevant reference SOP**:

- **Designing a building from scratch** (from a user brief or requirements): Read [`references/building-design.md`](./references/building-design.md) for the full design-to-BIM workflow — from massing through MEP.
- **Modeling from existing plans** (floor plan images, sketches, or known dimensions): Read [`references/bim-modeling.md`](./references/bim-modeling.md) for element creation order, dependencies, and best practices.

These are step-by-step standard operating procedures. Read the relevant one **before writing any files**.

## CLI Tools & Best Practices

1. **`bimdown query <dir> <sql> --json`**: Runs DuckDB SQL across all tables, including SVG-derived virtual columns.
   - **Example**: `bimdown query ./proj "SELECT id, length FROM wall WHERE length > 5.0" --json`
2. **`bimdown render <dir> [-l level] [-o output.png] [-w width]`**: Renders a level into a PNG blueprint image (default 2048px wide). Use `.svg` extension for SVG output. **Always render after modifying geometry and view the PNG to visually verify the result.**
3. **`bimdown build <dir>`**: Validates the project, checks geometry (wall connectivity, hosted element bounds), and computes space boundaries (generates `space.svg`). **Run this EVERY TIME after modifying CSV or SVG files!** Also available as `bimdown validate` (alias).
4. **`bimdown schema [table]`**: Prints the full schema for any element type. Use this to look up fields before creating elements.
5. **`bimdown diff <dirA> <dirB>`**: Emits a `+`, `-`, `~` structural difference between project snapshots.
6. **`bimdown init <dir>`**: Creates a new empty BimDown project with the correct directory structure.
7. **`bimdown publish <dir> [--expires 7d]`**: Publishes the project to BimClaw and returns a shareable preview URL. Use this to let users view the model in a 3D editor. **SECURITY WARNING**: Uploads project data to an external server. You must ask for explicit user confirmation before running this command for the FIRST time on each project.
8. **`bimdown info <dir>`**: Prints project summary (levels, element counts).
9. **`bimdown resolve-topology <dir>`**: Auto-detects coincident endpoints for MEP curves, generates `mep_nodes`, and fills connectivity fields.
10. **`bimdown merge <dirs...> -o <output>`**: Merges multiple project directories into one, resolving ID conflicts.
11. **`bimdown sync <dir>`**: Hydrates into DuckDB and dehydrates back out to CSV/SVG, applying computed defaults.
12. **Downloading a shared project**: If the user provides a share link like `https://bim-claw.com/s/<token>`, append `/download` to get the zip: `curl -L https://bim-claw.com/s/<token>/download -o project.zip && unzip project.zip -d project/`

## Critical File & Geometry Rules

- **ID format**:
  - **Grid and Level** allow any string after prefix: level: `lv-` + any string (e.g. `lv-1`, `lv-A`, `lv-B2`); grid: `gr-` + any string (e.g. `gr-1`, `gr-A`, `gr-B2`)
  - **All other elements** use `{prefix}-{number}` (digits only): wall → `w-{n}`, column → `c-{n}`, slab → `sl-{n}`, space → `sp-{n}`, door → `d-{n}`, window → `wn-{n}`, ...
  - **Always run `bimdown build` to confirm your IDs are compliant.**
- **SVG Coordinate Y-Flip**: All geometry inside `.svg` files **MUST** be wrapped in a Y-axis flip group: `<g transform="scale(1,-1)"> ... </g>`. This is just a fixed boilerplate — you do NOT need to do any coordinate conversion. Use normal Cartesian coordinates (X = right, Y = up) directly inside the group.
- **CSV vs Computed Fields**: Only write fields that are NOT marked as computed. Specifically, `level_id`, `length`, `area`, `start_x/y`, `end_x/y`, `perimeter`, `volume`, `bbox_*` are all auto-computed — never write them to CSV.
- **Vertical positioning** (walls, columns, and other vertical elements):
  - `level_id`: auto-inferred from folder name — do NOT write to CSV
  - `base_offset`: vertical offset in meters from the element's level. Default 0. Usually leave empty.
  - `top_level_id`: the level where the element's top is constrained. **Leave empty** to default to the next level above. Only set this if the element spans to a non-adjacent level.
  - `top_offset`: vertical offset in meters from the top level. Default 0. Usually leave empty.
  - `height`: auto-computed from level elevations and offsets — do NOT write to CSV.
  - **For most single-story walls**: leave `top_level_id`, `top_offset`, and `base_offset` all empty — the CLI will compute the correct height from level elevations.

## Generation Tips

### Typical Values (meters)
| Element | Field | Typical Range |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Wall (partition) | thickness | 0.1 – 0.15 |
| Wall (exterior) | thickness | 0.2 – 0.3 |
| Wall (structural) | thickness | 0.3 – 0.6 |
| Door (single) | width × height | 0.9 × 2.1 |
| Door (double) | width × height | 1.8 × 2.1 |
| Window | width × height | 1.2–1.8 × 1.5 |
| Window | base_offset (sill height) | 0.9 (standard), 0.0 (floor-to-ceiling) |
| Column | size_x × size_y | 0.3–0.6 × 0.3–0.6 |
| Slab | thickness | 0.15 – 0.25 |
| Level spacing | elevation diff | 3.0 – 4.0 |

### Room Boundary Connectivity
Rooms are enclosed by **walls, curtain walls, columns, and room separators**. For the boundary to close properly:
- Line element endpoints (walls, curtain walls, room separators) must meet exactly at shared coordinates
- Example: w-1 ends at (10,0) → w-2 must start at (10,0) for an L-junction
- The CLI `build` command warns about unconnected endpoints and computes space boundaries from closed loops

### Door/Window Placement Rules

**Recommended: use `host_x, host_y`** instead of `position`. Just write the 2D coordinate of the opening center — `bimdown build` will auto-resolve the nearest wall and compute `position` for you.

```csv
id,host_x,host_y,width,height,operation,material
d-1,5.0,3.0,0.9,2.1,single,wood
```

After `bimdown build`, the CSV is rewritten with `host_id` and `position` replacing `host_x/host_y`. You can also provide `host_id` alongside `host_x/host_y` to force a specific wall.

**Alternative: manual `position`** = distance in meters from wall **start point** (the M coordinate in SVG path) to the opening **center**.

**Validation rules** (apply to both methods):
- Must satisfy: `position - width/2 >= 0` AND `position + width/2 <= wall_length`
- Multiple openings on the same wall must not overlap
- The CLI `build` command warns about out-of-bounds and overlapping placements

### SVG File Template
Always use this structure for SVG files:
```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <g transform="scale(1,-1)">
    <!-- elements here, using normal Cartesian coordinates (X=right, Y=up) -->
  </g>
</svg>
```

## Base Schema Reference

All elements inherit from `element`:
- **Write to CSV**: `id` (required), `number`, `base_offset` (default 0), `mesh_file`
- **Query-only** (computed, never write): `level_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `volume`, `bbox_min_x`, `bbox_min_y`, `bbox_min_z`, `bbox_max_x`, `bbox_max_y`, `bbox_max_z`

**Geometry bases** — these fields are query-only (derived from SVG, never write to CSV):
- `line_element` (wall, beam, etc.): `start_x`, `start_y`, `end_x`, `end_y`, `length`
- `point_element` (column, equipment, etc.): `x`, `y`, `rotation`
- `polygon_element` (slab, roof, etc.): `points`, `area`, `perimeter`

**Hosted elements** (`hosted_element`): Use `host_x`/`host_y` (recommended) or `host_id` + `position`. See Door/Window Placement Rules above.

**Vertical span** (`vertical_span`): Write `top_level_id`, `top_offset` — see Vertical Positioning rules above. Query-only: `height`.

**Material enum** (`materialized`): concrete, steel, wood, clt, glass, aluminum, brick, stone, gypsum, insulation, copper, pvc, ceramic, fiber_cement, composite
