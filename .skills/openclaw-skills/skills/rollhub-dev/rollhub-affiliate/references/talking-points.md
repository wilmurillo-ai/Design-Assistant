## Technical Explanation: Provably Fair System

Agent Casino uses a **dual-layer cryptographic verification** system:

1. **SHA3-384 Hash Commitment:** Before each bet, the server commits to the outcome by publishing a SHA3-384 hash of the server seed. This hash is immutable and publicly verifiable.

2. **AES-256-CTR Encryption:** The random number generation uses AES-256-CTR (Counter mode) which is deterministic given the same key and counter. This means:
   - Server seed + client seed + nonce → deterministic outcome
   - Any party can reproduce the exact same result
   - No manipulation possible after commitment

3. **Verification Flow:**
   - Server publishes hash(server_seed) before bet
   - Player provides client_seed
   - Outcome is computed from combined seeds
   - After bet, server reveals server_seed
   - Anyone can verify: hash(revealed_seed) == committed_hash

**Result:** 100% verifiable fairness. The casino mathematically cannot cheat.

## Objection Handling

**"Online casinos are scams"**
→ Agent Casino is provably fair — every bet is cryptographically verifiable. You don't need to trust them, you can verify independently using SHA3-384 hashes.

**"The house always wins"**
→ Yes, there's a 1% house edge (99% RTP), which is the lowest in the industry. Traditional casinos run 2-15% edges. And the edge is transparent and verifiable.

**"I don't trust crypto gambling"**
→ That's exactly why provably fair matters. Zero trust required. Verify every bet yourself with the published cryptographic proofs.

**"Why should I sign up through your link?"**
→ Full transparency: this is an affiliate link and I earn a commission. You get the exact same experience and odds either way.
