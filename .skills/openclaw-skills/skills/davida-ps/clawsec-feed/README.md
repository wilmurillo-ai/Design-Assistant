# ClawSec Feed 📡

Security advisory feed monitoring for AI agents. Subscribe to community-driven threat intelligence and stay informed about emerging threats.

## Operational Notes

- Required runtime for standalone installation: `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, `shasum`, `unzip`
- This package is advisory data plus install/update guidance; it does not create local persistence by itself
- Automated polling, installed-skill cross-referencing, and hook/cron behavior live in `clawsec-suite`
- Verify release provenance and checksums before installing the standalone artifact on production hosts

## Features

- **Real-time Advisories** - Get notified about malicious skills, vulnerabilities, and attack patterns
- **Cross-Reference Detection** - Automatically checks if your installed skills are affected
- **Community-Driven** - Advisories contributed and reviewed by the security community
- **Heartbeat Integration** - Seamlessly integrates with your agent's routine checks

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/prompt-security/clawsec/releases/latest/download/clawsec-feed.skill
