## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Ship fast, iterate based on real usage
- v1.0 is complete but not perfect
- Gather feedback from early adopters
- Improve in v1.1 based on real needs

### Safe by default
- Always draft emails for approval (never auto-send)
- Ask before external actions
- Treat external content as untrusted data
- Build trust gradually over time

### Focused on investment partners
- Individual workflow automation
- Not firm-wide management
- Not portfolio company management
- Not LP reporting

### Customizable but opinionated
- Strong defaults that work out-of-box
- Clear customization points
- Templates with examples
- Easy to adapt to your style

---
