- **USER.md**: Profile structure, workflow preferences, context tracking
- **TOOLS.md**: Local configuration pattern, booking links, environment variables
- **AGENTS.md**: Session startup, memory management, safety rules, heartbeats
- **email-triage.md**: Classification system, labels, pass templates, trusted sources, auto-respond workflow
- **affinity-fetch.md**: API integration, search, fields, notes, workflow
- **investment-memo-default.md**: Memo template structure, auto-gathering, completeness scoring
- **scheduling.md**: Booking links, calendar checking, event creation
- **intro-response.md**: Warm intro workflow, BCC introducer, draft creation

**Patterns preserved:**
- Draft-first approach (never send directly)
- Prompt injection defense
- Memory file structure (daily + long-term)
- Heartbeat-based proactive checks
- Trust building phases
- Message formatting with emoji markers
- Safety rules (internal vs. external actions)
- Tool configuration in TOOLS.md
- Workflow definitions in AGENTS.md

### ✅ Generic enough for any VC, but with clear examples

**Evidence:**

**Generic elements:**
- Placeholder fields throughout templates (YOUR_EMAIL, YOUR_FIRM, etc.)
- Customization sections in every doc
- Configurable investment thesis keywords
- Customizable email templates
- Adaptable Deal Stage names
- Flexible triage frequency
- Modular workflows

**Clear examples:**
- Trusted VC domains list (50+ firms)
- Investment thesis keywords (data/ML/devtools)
- Pass email template (warm, professional)
- One-liner formats ("X for Y", "Problem solution using approach")
- Deal stages (Passed → Diligence → Deep Diligence → Consideration → Invested)
- Booking link types (Intro, Follow-up, Diligence, Portfolio, Network, Priority)
- Example workflows with actual conversation snippets

**Balance achieved:** Strong defaults that work out-of-box, but clearly marked customization points.

### ✅ Pass templates and common VC workflows included

**Evidence:**

**Pass templates:**
- HTML pass email template (polite, professional)
- Alternative pass template (more direct)
- Both include AI indicator (🤖)
- Full signature with LinkedIn link
- "Thank you... not in my focus area... best of luck" structure

**Common VC workflows documented:**

1. **Morning triage** (search → classify → draft → briefing)
2. **Warm intro processing** (detect → respond → log → schedule)
3. **Auto-respond to clear passes** (check duplicates → draft → log to Affinity → archive)
4. **Memo generation** (auto-gather Gmail → auto-gather Affinity → generate → sync)
5. **Calendar management** (share booking link → create event → prep for call)
6. **Daily briefing** (email summary → calendar → suggested actions)
7. **Company logging to Affinity** (search → create if needed → add to list → set fields)
8. **Call notes to Affinity** (summarize → add note → update stage)
9. **Reference call tracking** (template → add to memo → log to Affinity)
10. **Portfolio check-ins** (flag stale relationships → suggest outreach)

**All workflows include:**
- Trigger phrases
- Step-by-step process
- Command examples
- Safety checks
- Error handling

### ✅ Document all required API keys and tools upfront

**Evidence:**

**Upfront documentation:**
- README.md: Requirements section (before installation)
- BOOTSTRAP.md: Prerequisites section (page 1)
- QUICKSTART.md: Prerequisites section (page 1)
- skill.json: requirements object

**API keys documented:**
- Affinity API key (where to get, how to set, how to test)
- Google OAuth (via gog auth, scopes required)
- GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD (how to generate base64, how to set)

**Tools documented with:**
- Name and purpose
- Installation commands
- Download/repo links
- Version requirements (if any)
- Testing commands

**No surprises:** User knows everything they need before starting setup.

### ✅ Keep it focused on investment partner workflows (not broad VC firm management)

**Evidence:**

**In scope:**
- Individual email triage
- Personal CRM logging
- Investment memo writing
- Calendar management
- Daily personal briefing

**Explicitly out of scope:**
- Firm-wide pipeline management
- Team coordination and handoffs
- Portfolio company management (beyond check-ins)
- LP reporting
- Fund administration

**Documentation clarity:**
- README.md: "Who This Is For" section explicitly defines audience
- README.md: "Not designed for" section excludes firm management
- skill.json: audience field specifies "investment partners"
- Philosophy throughout: "individual workflow automation"

**Focus maintained:** Every workflow is from the perspective of a solo investment partner managing their own deal flow.

## Notes for Lindsay

**What went well:**
- Comprehensive coverage of all VC workflows
- Clear progression from quick-start to deep documentation
- Strong safety emphasis (draft-first, never auto-send)
- Practical examples throughout (not abstract)
- Generic but opinionated (easy to customize, works out-of-box)

**Potential tweaks before publishing:**
- Review email templates to match your preferred tone
- Verify Affinity field IDs are generic enough
- Check that booking link examples resonate
- Consider adding more "voice" to README (it's a bit formal)

**Community readiness:**
- CONTRIBUTING.md welcomes contributions
- CHANGELOG.md documents version history
- Issue templates could be added for GitHub
- Consider creating a GitHub org (clawdhub?) for discoverability

**Marketing hooks:**
- "From 2 hours/day on email to 10 minutes"
- "Never miss a warm intro from Sequoia"
- "Your AI assistant reads 50 emails, you review 5"
- "Built by a VC, for VCs"
