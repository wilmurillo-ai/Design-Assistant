## Features

- **ASCII Art** - Immersive retro monster visuals

- **Stats System** - Hunger, happiness, health, strength, speed, intelligence
- **Battle System** - Turn-based pet vs pet combat

python scripts/mon.py "Fluffy" play
python scripts/mon.py "Fluffy" status

# Battle
python scripts/battle.py "Fluffy" "Rival"

## Evolution System

Your MoltMon evolves based on:

| Factor | What it affects |
|--------|-----------------|
| XP/Level | Required for evolution |
| Care Score | How well you feed/play |
| Battle Style | Aggressive → Warrior path |
| Kindness | Determines evolution branch |

### Evolution Paths

- **Warrior** (kindness ≤30) - Aggressive/battle pets  
- **Balanced** - Mix of both
