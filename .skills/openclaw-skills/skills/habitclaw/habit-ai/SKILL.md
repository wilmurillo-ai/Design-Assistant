## Logging Meals — The Right Way

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use the AI model to analyze food, then POST /meals with the EXACT structure below

Do NOT call `/analyze/food-image` or `/analyze/meal-description` — instead, use your own vision/language capabilities to analyze the food, then construct the exact JSON structure below and POST it to `/meals`.

### Step 0: Check user profile for allergens/diet

Before analyzing, call `GET /profile` to check `foodSensitivities` and `diet` fields. Factor these into:
- **healthScore** — lower the score if the meal contains ingredients the user is sensitive to
- **healthScoreExplanation** — mention the general nutritional pros/cons
- **healthSensitivityExplanation** — if the meal contains any of the user's allergens/sensitivities, explain which ingredients are problematic and why. Leave empty string if no sensitivities match.

### Step 1: Analyze the food yourself

For **photos**: Look at the image and identify each ingredient, estimate portions, and calculate nutrition using USDA data.

For **descriptions**: Parse the meal description and calculate nutrition the same way.

### Step 2: POST /meals with the EXACT structure

Every field matters. iOS reads from `nutritionalSummary` (nested object) — if it's missing, meals show as 0 calories.

  "mealName": "Grilled Chicken Salad with Ranch",

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `mealName` | string | **Yes** | Display name (e.g. "Chicken Caesar Salad"). Without this, the meal has no name in the app. |
| `calories` | number | **Yes** | Total calories (kcal). Must be > 0. |
| `protein` | number | Yes | Total protein in grams |
| `carbs` | number | Yes | Total carbohydrates in grams |
| `fat` | number | Yes | Total fat in grams |
| `fiber` | number | Yes | Total fiber in grams |
| `sodium` | number | Yes | Total sodium in milligrams |
| `sugar` | number | Yes | Total sugar in grams |
| `healthScore` | integer | Yes | 1-10. How healthy is this meal overall? (1=very unhealthy, 10=very healthy) |
| `mealType` | string | Yes | One of: `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, `snack` |
| `analysisConfidenceLevel` | integer | Yes | 1-10. How confident are you in the nutrition estimates? (1=wild guess, 10=exact data from packaging). For photo analysis use 6-8, for descriptions use 5-7. |
| `healthScoreExplanation` | string | Yes | 1-2 sentence explanation of the nutritional pros/cons (e.g. "Good protein from chicken but high sodium from the sausage and dressing.") |
| `healthSensitivityExplanation` | string | Yes | If the meal contains any of the user's allergens/food sensitivities (from profile), explain which ingredients are problematic. Empty string `""` if no sensitivities match or user has none set. |
| `ingredients` | array | Yes | Array of ingredient objects (see below) |
| `imageUrl` | string | No | URL of the food photo. Get this from `POST /meals/upload-image` first (see below). |
| `dateScanned` | string | No | ISO 8601 timestamp. Defaults to now if omitted. |
| `serving` | number | No | Serving multiplier (defaults to 1.0) |

### Ingredient Object

Each ingredient in the `ingredients` array must have:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Ingredient name (e.g. "grilled chicken breast") |
| `calories` | number | Calories for this ingredient's portion (kcal) |
| `protein` | number | Protein in grams |
| `carbs` | number | Carbs in grams |
| `fat` | number | Fat in grams |
| `sugar` | number | Sugar in grams |
| `fiber` | number | Fiber in grams |
| `sodium` | number | Sodium in milligrams |
| `healthScore` | integer | 1-10 health score for this specific ingredient |
| `measurementType` | string | **Must be one of:** `grams`, `ounces`, `cups`, `spoons`, `servings`. Use `servings` for pieces/slices/bowls/items. Use `spoons` for tablespoons/teaspoons. |
| `measurementValue` | number | Amount in the specified unit |

### Important Rules

1. **All nutrition values must be numbers, not strings.** `"calories": 520` not `"calories": "520"`
2. **Ingredient calories should sum to the total calories** (approximately — within 5%)
3. **`mealName` is mandatory** — without it, the meal is invisible on iOS
4. **`healthScore` is 1-10 integer** — use your judgment (fast food = 2-4, home-cooked balanced = 6-8, raw salad = 9-10)
5. **`analysisConfidenceLevel` is 1-10 integer** — be honest about uncertainty
6. **Sodium is in milligrams**, everything else is in grams (except calories in kcal)

### Uploading a meal photo (thumbnail)

If you have a food photo, upload it first to get a URL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://habitapp.ai/api/v1/meals/upload-image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HABITAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageBase64": "<base64-encoded-image>"}'
```

Returns: `{"success": true, "imageUrl": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/..."}`

Then pass `imageUrl` in your POST /meals call. You can also attach to an existing meal:

```json
{"imageBase64": "<base64>", "mealId": "<existing-meal-id>"}
```

**Full flow with photo:**
1. `POST /meals/upload-image` with base64 photo → get `imageUrl`
2. `POST /meals` with nutrition data + `imageUrl`

## Other Workflows

### Check remaining calories

1. GET `/nutrition/daily` for today's totals
2. GET `/profile` for calorie goal
3. Subtract: `caloriesGoal - totalCalories`

### Quick water log

```bash
curl -X POST https://habitapp.ai/api/v1/water \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HABITAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 500}'
```

Amount is in milliliters. 1 cup ≈ 237ml, 1 glass ≈ 250ml.

## Notes

- Dates default to today if omitted (uses user's timezone from profile)
- Water amount is in **milliliters**
- Weight is in **kilograms** (1 lb ≈ 0.4536 kg)
- Steps auto-calculate calories burned if profile has height/weight/gender
- Max 5 API keys per account
