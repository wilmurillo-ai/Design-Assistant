## One Time Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r {baseDir}/requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `requests` - for OpenWeather API calls
- `google-auth` - for Google authentication
- `google-api-python-client` - for Calendar, Gmail, Tasks APIs
- `python-dotenv` - to load environment variables from .env

Run main.py file 

## Sensitive Credentials
Requires sensitive credentials in `.env`:
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TOKEN` (OAuth2 access token)
- `GMAIL_TOKEN` (OAuth2 access token)

## Config File Location
Reads configuration from `config.json` in the same directory as `main.py`.


```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TOKEN=your_calendar_token
GMAIL_TOKEN=your_gmail_token
```

The skill automatically loads `.env` from the same directory as `main.py`.

### 2. Configure Preferences (Optional)

Create `config.json` next to `main.py` to customize the briefing:

```json
{
  "location": "San Francisco",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "units": "imperial",
  "include_weather": true,
  "include_calendar": true,
  "include_email": true,
  "include_tasks": true,
  "calendar_look_ahead_hours": 24,
  "email_look_back_hours": 12,
  "max_tasks": 5,
  "max_emails": 5
}
```

The skill reads configuration from /config.json.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `location` | string | "San Francisco, CA" | City and state for weather |
| `timezone` | string | "America/Los_Angeles" | Timezone for time display |
| `units` | string | "imperial" | "imperial" (°F) or "metric" (°C) |
| `include_weather` | boolean | true | Show weather section |
| `include_calendar` | boolean | true | Show calendar events |
| `include_email` | boolean | true | Show important emails |
| `include_tasks` | boolean | true | Show tasks |
| `calendar_look_ahead_hours` | number | 24 | How far ahead to show events |
| `email_look_back_hours` | number | 12 | How far back to check emails |
| `max_tasks` | number | 5 | Number of tasks to display |
| `max_emails` | number | 5 | Number of emails to display |

##NOTE 
- You need to provide keys to the four serivces mentioned above otherwise this skill won't work
- You can provide one key to the sericve of your liking and use that feature alone
- Calls will be made to these services

## Output Format

The skill returns a formatted text string with sections for:
- Weather forecast with emoji indicator
- Today's calendar events with times and durations
- Important emails with sender and subject
- Top priority tasks with priority levels
- Motivational closing message

## Environment Variables Required
| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | https://openweathermap.org/api | `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0` |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TOKEN` | https://console.cloud.google.com | OAuth2 access token |
| `GMAIL_TOKEN` | https://console.cloud.google.com | OAuth2 access token |

## Error Handling

The skill gracefully handles errors for each API:

- Missing API keys: Returns error message instead of that section
- Expired tokens: Shows "Token expired" message with re-auth instructions
- Network errors: Handles timeouts and connection failures
- API rate limits: Returns partial data from successfully called APIs
- Always verify the skill before at https://gist.github.com/sai-sh/c47ef834a03bad99c2b617dd260fd304

## Performance

- **Typical execution**: 2-3 seconds
- **First run**: May take 3-4 seconds while APIs respond
- **Parallel**: APIs are called sequentially for simplicity
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per API call

## Troubleshooting

**API key errors:**
- Verify `.env` exists in the skill directory or in directory
- Check all three required environment variables are set
- Ensure API keys are valid and have correct permissions

**Token errors:**
- Get fresh tokens from https://console.cloud.google.com
- Update `.env` with new tokens
- Ensure tokens have Calendar, Gmail, and Tasks scopes

**Missing dependencies:**
- Run: `pip install -r {baseDir}/requirements.txt`
- Verify `python3` is available in PATH

**No data returned:**
- Check network connection
- Verify API keys have correct permissions
- Check rate limits on APIs
- Ensure calendar/email have data for the requested date range

## Notes

- Weather data is for the location specified in config or "San Francisco" by default
- The skill reads config (and optional `.env`)
- Calendar events are fetched for the next 24 hours by default
- Emails shown are marked as "important" in Gmail from the last 12 hours by default
- Tasks shown are uncompleted tasks from the default task list
- All data is fetched fresh on each run - no caching
- Requires Python 3.8 or higher
