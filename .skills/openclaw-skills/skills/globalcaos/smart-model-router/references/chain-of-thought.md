# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Techniques

When and how to use CoT to get better results from any tier.

## Core Principle

CoT prompting makes the model show its work — intermediate steps before the final answer. A study showed GPT-3.5 with agentic looping achieved 95.1% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4's 67% zero-shot. The technique matters more than the model.

## Techniques (By Complexity)

### 1. Zero-Shot CoT (Free, Always Works)
Just add "Think step by step" or "Let's work through this."
- Works on: All models, all tiers
- Best for: Quick boost on any reasoning task
- Cost: ~5 extra tokens in prompt

### 2. Structured CoT (Mid Tier+)
Give the model a reasoning template:
```
First, identify the key constraints.
Then, evaluate each option against those constraints.
Finally, choose the best option and explain why.
```
- Works best on: mid/strong tiers
- Best for: Decision-making, analysis, comparisons

### 3. Self-Consistency (Multiple Samples)
Run the same prompt 3-5 times, take the majority answer.
- Cost: 3-5x per query
- Worth it for: High-stakes decisions, math, logic
- Implementation: Spawn 3 sub-agents with same prompt, compare

### 4. Tree of Thought (Strong Tier Only)
Model explores multiple reasoning branches, evaluates each, backtracks:
```
Consider 3 different approaches to this problem.
For each, work through the first 2 steps.
Evaluate which approach is most promising.
Continue only with the best one.
```
- Cost: 3-5x token usage
- Worth it for: Complex planning, architectural decisions

### 5. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
Interleave thinking and tool use:
```
Thought: I need to check if the API endpoint exists.
Action: Read the routes file.
Observation: The endpoint is defined at line 42.
Thought: Now I need to check the middleware chain...
```
- This is what Claude Code's TAOR loop IS
- Best for: Any task involving tool use + reasoning

## When CoT Actually Helps vs Wastes Tokens

### Helps (Use It)
- Math and arithmetic (huge improvement)
- Multi-step logic problems
- Code debugging (trace the execution path)
- Decision-making with tradeoffs
- Anything where "showing work" catches errors

### Doesn't Help (Skip It)
- Simple lookups (what time is it?)
- Direct extraction (pull the email from this text)
- Translation (models already do this well)
- Formatting (mechanical, not reasoning)
- Tasks where the answer is obvious

### Rule: Match CoT to Tier
| Tier | CoT Strategy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| flash | None | Tasks are too simple, CoT wastes tokens |
| fast | Zero-shot CoT only if reasoning is involved | Light touch |
| mid | Structured CoT for complex sub-tasks | Good balance |
| strong | Full CoT, Tree of Thought for hard problems | Maximize capability |
| reasoning | Native CoT (o3 does this internally) | Don't prompt for it — it's built in |

## Prompt Patterns That Improve Any Model

### The Constraint-First Pattern
```
Given these constraints: [list]
And this goal: [goal]
What is the best approach?
```
Giving constraints BEFORE the question focuses reasoning.

### The Verify-Your-Answer Pattern
```
[task]
After answering, verify your answer by checking it against the original requirements.
```
Cheap self-check that catches obvious errors.

### The Expert-Persona Pattern
```
You are a senior [domain] engineer with 15 years of experience.
```
Activates domain-specific reasoning patterns. Measurably improves quality in specialized tasks.

## CoT Budget Rule

If CoT adds >20% to your token cost and the task is non-critical, skip it. The model-router's tier system already puts hard tasks on capable models — CoT is the cherry on top, not the cake.
