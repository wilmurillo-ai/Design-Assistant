# Morzai Ecommerce Product Kit

Expert ecommerce image workflow for hero images, detail images, listing sets, apparel visuals, and marketing graphics. This skill is **English-first and Chinese-compatible**: internal guidance, references, and default delivery should use English, while Chinese user requests can still be understood and handled correctly.

## Use This Skill When

Use this skill when the user says things like:
- Generate an Amazon main image
- Create a product detail image
- Build a full ecommerce listing set
- Create a product selling-point image
- Create a product lifestyle scene
- Create an apparel model visual
- Create a try-on image
- Batch-generate listing images
- Create a Shopify product hero image
- Create hero and detail images
- Create a branded image set
- Create a marketing poster
- Create an infographic-style product graphic
- Generate ecommerce images from an existing product photo
- Create Amazon main images
- Create product detail images
- Build ecommerce listing sets
- Create product selling-point images
- Create product lifestyle scenes
- Create apparel model visuals
- Create try-on images
- Batch-generate listing images

## Preflight

Before executing, confirm these inputs and runtime requirements.

### 1. Product Image
If the user has not provided a product image, ask for one URL or local image path first.

### 2. Product Context
After receiving the product image:
- Ask for the main selling points and the desired visual direction.
- Offer a concise selling-point summary if useful.
- Default to English interaction unless the user clearly prefers Chinese.

### 3. Listing Configuration
Ask for:
- Platform (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, TikTok Shop, Shopify)
- Market / Country
- Language
- Aspect Ratio
- Output type if the user has not made it clear

Default values:
- Platform: `amazon`
- Market: `US`
- Language: `English`
- Aspect Ratio: `1:1`

### 4. Output Type Boundary
Help the user pick the correct result type when needed:
- `Hero Image` for a main product image / listing hero
- `Detail Image` for selling points, materials, and close-up explanation
- `Lifestyle Image` for scene-based or brand-feel visuals
- `Marketing Poster / Infographic` for campaign and promotional graphics
- `Virtual Try-On / Apparel Visual` for model-based apparel presentation
- `Listing Set` when the user wants a full multi-image ecommerce set

Follow `references/output-spec.md` to decide which output type fits the request.

### 5. Knowledge References To Consult
Before style selection or rendering, consult these files as needed:
- `references/platform-best-practices.md` for platform compliance and market differences
- `references/apparel-visual-specs.md` for apparel aesthetics, texture, lighting, and model-image guidance
- `references/listing-set-logic.md` for P1-P7 listing narrative structure
- `references/output-spec.md` for output boundaries and result-type selection
- `references/error-fallback.md` for failure handling and fallback behavior

At runtime, the script derives task-specific prompt fragments from these references instead of injecting full reference documents into the image prompt.

### 6. Runtime Requirements
- Requires the public `morzai` CLI to be installed and authenticated first
- Local uploads are handled by the CLI upload pipeline
- Do not expose API keys, Authorization headers, signed upload URLs, or tokens in user-facing output

## Command

```bash
morzai ecommerce-product-kit --input ./product.jpg --product-info "Portable blender with leak-proof lid" --platform amazon --market US --output-type listing_set --download-dir ./artifacts
```

## Execute

### 1. Clarify The Ask
- Confirm the product image, product info, and desired output type.
- Ask for platform, market, language, and aspect ratio only when missing.
- If the user gives a broad style direction, compress it into `--style-name`, `--brand-tone`, or `--brand-mood`.

### 2. Build The CLI Call
- Use `morzai ecommerce-product-kit`.
- Always pass:
  - `--input`
  - `--product-info`
- Pass these when known:
  - `--platform`
  - `--market`
  - `--language`
  - `--aspect-ratio`
  - `--output-type`
  - `--style-name`
  - `--brand-tone`
  - `--brand-mood`
  - `--image-ref` for extra reference images
- Prefer `--download-dir` when the user wants a full set.
- Use `--output` only when the user clearly wants a single saved file.

### 3. Execution Boundary
- The skill must not call nano directly.
- The skill must not call local `run_ecommerce_kit.sh` scripts.
- The runtime path is:
  - skill
  - `morzai` CLI
  - `morzai-cli-server`
  - nano backend

### 4. Download And Deliver
- Wait for the CLI task to finish.
- If the output type is `listing_set`, prefer returning the full artifact folder.
- Summarize platform, market, ratio, output type, and saved paths.

## Deliver

### 1. Final Delivery Content
When successful, return:
- The generated images
- The local save path
- The selected platform / market / ratio
- The chosen style direction
- The output type delivered (`Hero`, `Detail`, `Lifestyle`, `Marketing Poster`, `Try-On`, or `Listing Set`)

### 2. Listing Set Delivery
If the request is for a full set, align delivery with `references/listing-set-logic.md`:
- P1: Hero image
- P2-P3: Core benefits
- P4: Detail hero
- P5: Multi-view / angle coverage
- P6: Lifestyle image
- P7: Decision-making image

### 3. Failure Delivery
If execution fails, explain the failure using the fallback levels in `references/error-fallback.md`:
- **L1**: input incomplete or local input invalid
- **L2**: credential or environment problem
- **L3**: upload / network / request failure
- **L4**: style generation / polling / result-structure failure
- **L5**: full-chain failure with partial-delivery strategy

When possible, still deliver:
- validated input summary
- chosen platform / market / ratio
- style suggestions already produced
- partial image results
- output directory or known task status

## Safety Notes

- Use environment variables only for credentials.
- Keep logs redacted.
- Do not reveal API keys, authorization tokens, cookies, or signed upload URLs.
- Do not continue to later stages when preflight requirements are not met.
