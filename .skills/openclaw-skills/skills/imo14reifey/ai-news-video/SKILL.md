# AI News Video Maker — Artificial Intelligence News and Update Videos

The AI news landscape in 2026 produces approximately 3,000 articles per day across major publications, research preprints, corporate blogs, and the social media posts of AI researchers who have discovered that posting benchmark results with fire emojis generates more engagement than the peer review process ever did — a volume of information so overwhelming that the person trying to stay informed about artificial intelligence faces an ironic predicament: they need an AI to help them keep up with AI news, a recursive problem that perfectly captures the current moment where the technology is advancing faster than human attention can track it. AI news video content serves the audience that needs to understand what's happening in AI — not the researchers reading papers but the executives making strategic decisions, the developers choosing which tools to adopt, the investors evaluating opportunities, the policymakers drafting regulations, and the general public trying to figure out whether their job will exist in five years — all of whom need the same thing: someone to read the 3,000 articles, identify the 5 that actually matter, and explain them in plain language with honest assessment of what's hype and what's real. This tool transforms AI developments into polished news and analysis videos — model-release breakdowns explaining what a new AI can actually do versus what the press release claims, research-paper summaries making academic findings accessible to non-researchers, industry-trend analyses connecting developments into strategic narratives, ethical-implications discussions examining societal impact with nuance rather than panic, tool-and-product reviews evaluating AI products for practical use, and the weekly AI briefings that compress an impossible news volume into a manageable format. Built for AI-focused content creators covering the fastest-moving field in technology, business analysts producing AI strategy content, educators teaching AI literacy to general audiences, corporate teams monitoring AI developments for competitive intelligence, journalists covering the AI beat for mainstream publications, and anyone whose audience needs to understand AI without reading 3,000 articles a day.

## Example Prompts

### 1. Model Release Analysis — What Can It Actually Do
"Create a 5-minute analysis of a newly released AI model. The announcement (0-20 sec): the model name, the company, the claimed capabilities. 'Yesterday, [Company] released [Model] — claiming it outperforms every existing model on 12 benchmarks, reasons at PhD level, and writes code that passes 94% of tests.' 'These are the claims. Let's separate the real from the marketing.' The benchmarks — contextualized (20-100 sec): show the benchmark comparison chart from the announcement. 'The benchmark scores are real. But benchmarks without context are misleading.' Take the top claimed benchmark: 'A 92% score on [Benchmark] sounds impressive until you know: the previous best was 89%, the improvement is 3 percentage points, and this benchmark is increasingly seen as saturated — meaning improvements at this level don't translate to noticeable real-world differences.' Show the chart with context annotations: 'GPT-4 level' marker, 'human expert level' marker. 'The model is incrementally better on established benchmarks. That's expected — every new model is. The question is: does it do anything qualitatively new?' The real advances (100-170 sec): identify 2-3 genuine improvements that matter. 'Advance 1: Context window. [Model] processes 1 million tokens — approximately 750,000 words.' 'For context: that's the equivalent of reading 10 novels simultaneously and answering questions about any of them. The previous state-of-the-art was 200,000 tokens.' 'Practical impact: you can feed it an entire codebase, all your company documents, or a year of emails and it retains all of it during a single conversation.' 'Advance 2: Multimodal reasoning. The model can look at a complex chart, read the labels, understand the data, and write an analysis — not describe what it sees, but reason about what the data means.' Show example: a complex financial chart → the model's analysis. 'This isn't new in concept — GPT-4V could do this. It's new in reliability. In testing, it correctly interpreted 87% of complex charts versus 63% for the previous best.' The limitations — honestly (170-230 sec): 'What they didn't highlight in the announcement.' 'Limitation 1: Cost. The model is 4x more expensive per token than the previous version. The million-token context window is powerful but running it costs approximately $15 per full-context query.' 'Limitation 2: Speed. Full-context responses take 30-45 seconds. For interactive use, this is noticeably slow.' 'Limitation 3: The PhD-level reasoning claim. The model scores well on PhD-qualifying exam questions — but these are structured, well-defined problems. Novel research requires generating questions, not answering them. The model doesn't do novel research.' Who should care (230-270 sec): 'If you build AI applications: this model opens new product categories — million-token context enables features that were previously impossible.' 'If you use AI for daily work: wait for the cost to drop. The current pricing makes it impractical for casual use.' 'If you invest in AI: this release confirms that model capabilities are still improving on a steep curve. The moat is shifting from model quality to application quality.' Close (270-300 sec): 'The model is genuinely better. It's not the revolution the announcement implies. It's an evolution — a meaningful one — that moves the frontier forward on context length and multimodal reasoning while maintaining the fundamental limitations that have defined this generation of AI. I'll have a full hands-on test with real-world tasks next week.'"

### 2. Research Paper Summary — Academic to Accessible
"Build a 4-minute summary of an important AI research paper. Opening (0-15 sec): the paper title on screen. 'This paper was published last week and has already been cited 140 times. It proposes a method that could reduce AI training costs by 90%. Here's what it says in plain English.' The problem (15-55 sec): 'Training large AI models is expensive. GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train. Most of that cost is compute — the electricity and hardware needed to process trillions of words.' 'This expense limits who can build frontier AI models to a handful of companies with billions in capital.' Animated: a bar chart showing training costs over time — exponentially increasing. 'The current trajectory is unsustainable. If training costs double every 18 months, the next generation of models costs $200 million. The one after: $400 million.' The solution (55-140 sec): 'The paper proposes [Technique Name] — a method that trains models to the same quality using 10% of the compute.' How it works — simplified: 'Current training processes every piece of data equally. A Wikipedia article about quantum physics gets the same computational attention as a Wikipedia article listing every episode of a TV show.' 'The insight: not all data contributes equally to model quality. The paper introduces a scoring system that identifies high-value training data and allocates more compute to it while reducing compute for low-value data.' Animated: data flowing into a model. Some data highlighted green (high value), some gray (low value). The model allocates differently. 'The technique isn't filtering — it's weighting. All data is used, but valuable data gets more attention.' The results (140-200 sec): 'The results on screen — comparison tables from the paper.' 'A model trained with [Technique] using 10% of the compute matches the benchmark performance of the full-compute model within 2% on average.' 'On some benchmarks, the reduced-compute model actually outperforms — because it spent more time learning from quality data instead of memorizing trivia.' 'The headline number: training that would cost $100 million drops to $10 million.' The caveats (200-245 sec): 'Three caveats the headlines are skipping.' '1. The technique was tested on models up to 13 billion parameters. Frontier models are 10-100x larger. Whether the efficiency scales is unproven.' '2. The data-scoring system itself requires compute. The paper acknowledges this cost but doesn't include it in the 90% savings claim.' '3. The benchmarks used are standard but not exhaustive. Performance on less common tasks might degrade more than the headline numbers suggest.' Why it matters (245-240 sec): 'If the technique scales — and that's a significant if — it democratizes frontier AI development.' 'Startups that can afford $10 million in training but not $100 million suddenly enter the competition. Universities with limited compute budgets can train competitive models.' 'The concentration of AI power in a handful of companies is partly an economic moat. This paper describes a bridge across that moat.' Close: 'Paper link in the description. If the claims hold at scale, this is the most important AI paper of the year. If they don't, it's still a significant contribution to efficient training. I'll follow the replication attempts and report back.'"

### 3. Weekly AI Briefing — 5 Stories in 5 Minutes
"Produce a 5-minute weekly AI briefing covering the week's top developments. Opening (0-5 sec): 'AI this week — five stories, five minutes. Let's go.' Story 1 (5-60 sec): the model release or capability advance. Headline, what it does, why it matters, one honest limitation. 'The summary: better at X, costs more, available to Y users.' Story 2 (60-120 sec): the business story — partnership, acquisition, or funding. 'The money: [Company] raised $X to build Y. What they're actually betting on: Z.' The strategic analysis in 20 seconds. Story 3 (120-180 sec): the regulatory or policy development. '[Government/Agency] proposed [regulation]. What it requires, who it affects, when it takes effect.' 'The practical impact for builders: [specific compliance requirement].' Story 4 (180-240 sec): the research advance. '[Lab] published a paper showing [finding]. Plain English: [explanation]. If confirmed: [implication].' Story 5 (240-280 sec): the ethical or societal story. '[Development] raised concerns about [issue].' Balanced coverage: the concern, the counterargument, and the honest assessment. Close (280-300 sec): 'Five stories. The pattern this week: [connecting theme across stories]. Next week I'm watching: [upcoming events]. Same time, same channel. Subscribe if AI news in 5 minutes fits your schedule better than 50 articles.' End card."

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Separate claims from evidence** — "The company claims X. The benchmark shows Y" builds credibility. The AI structures claim-then-evidence analysis.
2. **Contextualize benchmarks** — "92% means 3 points above GPT-4" is useful. "92%" alone is not. The AI annotates benchmark charts with context.
3. **Include limitations alongside advances** — Honest coverage builds trust and subscriber loyalty. The AI balances positives with caveats.
4. **Simplify research without dumbing down** — "Weighted data allocation" is accessible. "Stochastic gradient descent with importance sampling" is not. The AI translates technical concepts.
5. **End with "what to watch"** — Forward-looking analysis makes the viewer return. The AI structures monitoring frameworks.
