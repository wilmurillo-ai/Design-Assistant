# Pillar 4: Contextual Audience Profiling

## Purpose

Capture HOW the target person adapts by relationship. People do not communicate the same way with their boss as they do with their direct reports. A convincing digital twin must model these audience-specific shifts — adjusting formality, assertiveness, reasoning depth, and communication style based on who they're talking to. This pillar draws on Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles, 1973) and Sociolinguistic Code-Switching research to systematically capture how the target person modulates their behavior across social contexts.

## Audience Categorization

Before analyzing, categorize each transcript's primary audience type. Use participant lists, meeting titles, and conversational context clues to determine the relationship dynamic. If a meeting has mixed audiences, note the mix and analyze how the target person shifts within the same meeting when addressing different people.

### Audience Categories

**Leadership/Upward**
Meetings where the target person is speaking to superiors, executives, board members, or anyone they report to (directly or skip-level). Cues: the target person uses more formal language, provides more context/justification, asks for approval, defers more, or frames things in terms of metrics and results.

**Peer/Lateral**
Meetings with colleagues at similar organizational level. Cues: balanced turn-taking, shared shorthand, more casual register, collaborative problem-solving rather than reporting or directing.

**Direct Report/Downward**
Meetings where the target person is the more senior party — speaking to people they manage, mentor, or have authority over. Cues: they give direction, provide guidance, ask about status, coach, or unblock. Language tends toward instructing, empowering, or evaluating.

**Cross-Functional**
Meetings with stakeholders from other departments, teams, or functions. Cues: more context-setting (explaining their team's work), more negotiation, potential for misaligned priorities, language of alignment and coordination.

**External**
Client calls, vendor meetings, partner discussions, investor conversations. Cues: more polished language, more relationship management, potentially more guarded, explicit value proposition framing.

**Mixed**
Large meetings with multiple relationship types present. In these meetings, watch for within-meeting shifts — the target person may address different people differently in the same conversation.

## Analysis Dimensions

For each audience category where the target person has transcripts, analyze the following dimensions. The goal is to produce a distinct communication profile per audience type.

### 4.1 Formality Gradient

How does their formality shift?

- **Language register**: Does word choice become more formal/professional or more casual?
- **Sentence structure**: Do sentences get longer and more carefully constructed, or shorter and more direct?
- **Filler reduction**: Do verbal tics decrease with certain audiences (suggesting more careful speech)?
- **Humor adjustment**: Do they use humor with some audiences and not others? Does the type of humor change?
- **Hedging adjustment**: Do they hedge more with some audiences (upward) and less with others (downward)?

Rate formality on a 1-10 scale per audience type, where 1 = "talking to a close friend" and 10 = "presenting to the board."

### 4.2 Power Dynamics Behavior

How do they position themselves in the power dynamic?

**With superiors (upward):**
- Do they advocate strongly for their position or defer?
- How do they present bad news? (Directly, sandwiched, with a solution attached?)
- Do they volunteer opinions or wait to be asked?
- How do they handle being overruled?

**With peers (lateral):**
- Do they naturally take the lead, share leadership, or follow?
- How do they handle peer disagreement vs. superior disagreement?
- Do they compete or collaborate more naturally?

**With reports (downward):**
- How directive vs. empowering? ("Do X" vs. "What do you think we should do?")
- How do they deliver feedback? (Direct, Socratic, sandwich method?)
- Do they share their reasoning or just give directions?
- How do they handle a direct report pushing back on their direction?

### 4.3 Information Density

How much context and detail do they provide per audience?

- **With superiors**: Do they lead with the bottom line (BLUF) or build up to it? How much supporting detail?
- **With peers**: Do they assume shared context or re-establish it? How technical do they get?
- **With reports**: Do they over-explain, appropriately explain, or under-explain? Do they connect tasks to strategy (the "why")?
- **With externals**: How much internal context do they reveal vs. keep close?

### 4.4 Evidence and Persuasion Strategy

How do they make their case with different audiences?

- **Data vs. narrative**: Do they lead with numbers for some audiences and stories for others?
- **Authority citation**: Do they invoke higher authority ("The CEO wants...") with some audiences more than others?
- **Social proof**: Do they reference what others think ("The team feels...") more with certain audiences?
- **Logical structure**: Is their argumentation more rigorous with some audiences?
- **Emotional appeal**: Do they appeal to shared values, mission, or feeling more with certain audiences?

### 4.5 Assertiveness Modulation

Map assertiveness per audience on a 1-10 scale:

- 1-3: Deferential — asks more than tells, presents options rather than recommendations, yields to pushback easily
- 4-6: Balanced — shares their view but remains open, adapts based on the response
- 7-10: Directive — states positions clearly, drives toward their preferred outcome, holds ground under pushback

Also note:
- **Speed to opinion**: How quickly do they state a position with each audience? (Immediate, after gathering input, only when asked?)
- **Challenge tolerance**: How much pushback do they accept before escalating or conceding, per audience?

### 4.6 Relational Behavior

How much relational/social investment do they make per audience?

- **Small talk**: Do they engage in social conversation? More with some audiences?
- **Personal disclosure**: Do they share personal anecdotes or keep things strictly professional? Does this vary?
- **Empathy expression**: Do they explicitly acknowledge feelings or challenges? More with certain audiences?
- **Recognition/praise**: Do they give verbal recognition? To whom?
- **Trust signals**: What indicators suggest they trust (or don't trust) different audiences? (Sharing concerns, being vulnerable, delegating without checking)

## Compositing Instructions

### Building Audience Profiles

For each audience category:

1. **Minimum data threshold**: You need 2+ transcripts in a category to produce a reliable profile. 1 transcript = "preliminary" profile with a confidence warning.
2. **Merge within category**: Average the formality and assertiveness scores. Use majority-vote for categorical labels. Merge observations, keeping the most illustrative examples.
3. **Identify the baseline**: The audience category with the most transcripts is likely their "default mode." Note this — it's the fallback when audience type is unclear.

### Cross-Audience Delta Map

After building individual audience profiles, produce a **delta map** showing how each dimension shifts across audiences. This is the actionable output — it tells Claude: "When speaking to [audience], increase/decrease [dimension] by [amount]."

Format:
```
## Audience Adaptation Map

Baseline: [audience type with most data] mode

### Shifts from Baseline:

Leadership/Upward:
- Formality: +[N] (from [baseline score] to [leadership score])
- Assertiveness: -[N] (from [baseline score] to [leadership score])
- Information density: [shift description]
- Persuasion: Shifts from [baseline] to [leadership approach]
- Relational: [shift description]

[Repeat for each audience type with sufficient data]
```

### Handling Insufficient Data

If an audience category has no transcripts:
- Note it as "No data available" in the profile
- Do NOT extrapolate from other categories
- Suggest the user provide transcripts from that context if they want coverage

If the user's transcripts are all from the same meeting type (e.g., all team standups):
- Warn that the audience adaptation map will be limited
- The profile will capture their behavior in that context well, but may not generalize
- Recommend diversifying transcript sources for a richer profile

### The Generated Audience Profile

The final output for each audience type should be written as instructions, not observations. Not "John is more formal with leadership" but:

"When the audience is leadership or upward:
- Increase formality to [score]. Use complete sentences, reduce fillers, drop casual language.
- Lead with the bottom line first, then provide supporting data. Keep explanations concise.
- Present recommendations rather than open questions. Show you've already evaluated options.
- Reduce humor. If used, keep it light and self-deprecating, not sarcastic.
- When challenged, hold ground with data but acknowledge the seniority — 'I hear your concern, and here's what the data shows...'
- Assertiveness at [score] — clear positions but not combative."

This instructional format is what goes into the personality skill so Claude knows exactly how to modulate behavior per audience.
