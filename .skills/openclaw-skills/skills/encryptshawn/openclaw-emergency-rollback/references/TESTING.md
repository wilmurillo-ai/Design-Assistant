# Emergency Recovery Test — Destructive

This test verifies the full recovery pipeline by deliberately breaking the
OpenClaw config and confirming the watchdog automatically restores it.

**This test is destructive.** During the test window (up to ~2 minutes), the
user's OpenClaw gateway will be non-functional. AI sessions, agents, and any
active connections will be interrupted.

---

## Before You Begin — Pre-Flight Checklist

Confirm ALL of these with the user before proceeding:

```
⚠️  Emergency Recovery Test — Pre-Flight Checklist

This test will:
  1. Save your current config as a test snapshot
  2. Save a manual recovery copy of openclaw.json
  3. Deliberately break your openclaw.json
  4. Restart the gateway (it will fail)
  5. Wait for the watchdog to auto-restore (~2 minutes)

During the test you WILL lose access to your AI session.

Requirements:
  □ You have terminal/SSH access to this machine right now
  □ You can run commands even if the AI agent is offline
  □ You understand this will interrupt all active sessions

Manual recovery command (if the test fails — keep this visible):
  cp ~/.openclaw-rollback/openclaw.recovery ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
  <your restart command here>

Type "yes, run the test" to proceed.
```

Fill in the actual restart command from `~/.openclaw-rollback/rollback-config.json`.

Do NOT proceed unless the user explicitly confirms.

## Test Procedure

### Step 1 — Verify Dependencies

```bash
~/.openclaw-rollback/scripts/recovery-test.mjs preflight
```

This checks that node, zip, unzip, and cron are available, that the rollback
directory is properly initialized, and that all scripts are present.
If anything fails, stop and fix it before continuing.

### Step 2 — Create Test Snapshot

```bash
~/.openclaw-rollback/scripts/snapshot.mjs "pre-test known-good config" "Snapshot taken before recovery test."
```

This saves the current working config as snapshot [1].

### Step 3 — Save Manual Recovery Copy

```bash
~/.openclaw-rollback/scripts/recovery-test.mjs save-recovery
```

This copies `openclaw.json` to `~/.openclaw-rollback/openclaw.recovery`.
This is the user's last-resort manual recovery if everything else fails.

Tell the user:

```
📋 Manual recovery copy saved. If the test fails and the watchdog does not
restore your config within 5 minutes, run these two commands from any terminal:

  cp ~/.openclaw-rollback/openclaw.recovery ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
  <restart command>

Keep this window open or write these commands down before proceeding.
```

### Step 4 — Arm the Watchdog (2 minutes)

```bash
~/.openclaw-rollback/scripts/watchdog-set.mjs 2
```

The watchdog is now armed. If nothing disarms it in 2 minutes, it will
automatically restore snapshot [1] and restart the gateway.

### Step 5 — Break the Config

```bash
~/.openclaw-rollback/scripts/recovery-test.mjs sabotage
```

This inserts `BROKEN_BY_RECOVERY_TEST` as the first line of `openclaw.json`,
making it invalid JSON. The gateway won't load, AI won't connect, nothing works.

### Step 6 — Restart the Gateway

Read the restart command from rollback-config.json and run it:

```bash
RESTART_CMD=$(node -e "console.log(require('$HOME/.openclaw-rollback/rollback-config.json').restartCommand)")
eval "$RESTART_CMD"
```

The gateway will attempt to start, fail to parse the broken config, and either
crash or run in a degraded state. This is expected.

### Step 7 — Wait for Recovery

The cron watchdog checks every 60 seconds. Combined with the 2-minute timer,
recovery should happen within ~2-3 minutes. The user should:

1. Wait 3 minutes
2. Try to connect to their agent
3. If the agent is back and working, the test passed

To verify programmatically:

```bash
~/.openclaw-rollback/scripts/recovery-test.mjs verify
```

### Step 8 — Report Results

If the config is restored and the gateway is running:

```
✅ Recovery test PASSED.

The watchdog detected the expired timer, restored snapshot [1],
and restarted the gateway automatically.

Your manual recovery copy is still at:
  ~/.openclaw-rollback/openclaw.recovery
You can delete it or keep it as an extra backup.
```

If the config was NOT restored after 5 minutes:

```
❌ Recovery test FAILED.

The watchdog did not fire. Possible causes:
  • cron service is not running (check: systemctl status cron)
  • cron PATH doesn't include node (check: which node, then add PATH to crontab)
  • the cron entry wasn't installed (check: crontab -l)

To restore manually:
  cp ~/.openclaw-rollback/openclaw.recovery ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
  <restart command>

Check the logs:
  cat ~/.openclaw-rollback/logs/restore.log
  cat ~/.openclaw-rollback/logs/change.log
```

---

## What the Test Validates

1. **Snapshot creation** — config files are captured and zipped correctly
2. **Watchdog arming** — cron entry installed with correct expiry
3. **Timer expiry detection** — restore-if-armed.mjs checks epoch against expiry
4. **Restore execution** — zip extracted to correct paths, overwriting broken files
5. **Gateway restart** — restart command fires after restore
6. **Watchdog disarm** — cron entry removed after firing

The `@reboot` cron path is NOT tested (requires an actual reboot).

## Cleaning Up After a Failed Test

If the automatic recovery didn't fire:

```bash
# 1. Restore the config
cp ~/.openclaw-rollback/openclaw.recovery ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# 2. Restart the gateway (use your actual command)
openclaw gateway restart

# 3. Disarm the watchdog cron so it doesn't fire later
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null | grep -v '# openclaw-watchdog') | crontab -

# 4. Mark watchdog as disarmed
node -e "
const fs=require('fs');
const wf=process.env.HOME+'/.openclaw-rollback/watchdog.json';
const w=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(wf,'utf8'));
w.armed=false;
fs.writeFileSync(wf,JSON.stringify(w,null,2));
console.log('Watchdog disarmed.');
"

# 5. Verify
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));console.log('Config is valid JSON')"
```
