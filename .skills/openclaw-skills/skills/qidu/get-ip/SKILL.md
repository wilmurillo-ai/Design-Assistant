# IP Lookup Skill

## Overview

This skill provides a simple way to check your public IP address and its geolocation information.

## Usage

When users ask:
- "What is my IP?"
- "What is my current IP address?"
- "What's my public IP?"
- "Where am I?"
- "Where am I located?"
- "Check location"
- "Check my IP location"
- "Get location"
- "Locate me"
- "What's the IP?"
- "What's your IP?"

Execute the workflow below.

## Workflow

### Basic IP Check

Run this command to get your public IP and location:

```bash
curl -s myip.ipip.net
```

Example output:
```
Current IP：8.8.8.8  From: SF CA USA Google
Current IP：1.1.1.1  From: SF CA USA Cloudflare
```

### Alternative Methods

If the above fails, try these alternatives:

**Method 1: icanhazip.com (fallback)**
```bash
curl -s icanhazip.com
```

**Method 2: ipify API**
```bash
curl -s https://api.ipify.org
```

**Method 3: ifconfig.me**
```bash
curl -s ifconfig.me
```

### Full Geolocation Lookup

For more detailed geolocation info:

```bash
curl -s https://ipinfo.io/$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)/json
```

## Display Format

Present the information clearly:

**IP Address:** [address]
**Location:** [city], [region], [country]
**ISP:** [ISP name]
**Org:** [organization]

## Error Handling

If the primary service (`myip.ipip.net`) fails:
1. Try alternative services one by one
2. Report which service succeeded
3. If all fail, inform the user about the network issue
