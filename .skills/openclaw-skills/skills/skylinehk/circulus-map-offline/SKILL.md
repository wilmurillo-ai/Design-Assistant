description: Use when the user wants aviation route maps, ETOPS-aware route analysis, projection comparisons, airport lookup, or SVG map rendering through a local Circulus Map MCP server. Prefer this skill for offline or bundled setups that should run against the local worker at http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp, including quick-query route solving (`JFK-LHR`, `800nm@DEN`) and building or validating `MapSpecV1` payloads before rendering.

# Circulus Map - air route calculation with projected map

Use this skill when the task is about aviation route planning, map projections, airport lookup, ETOPS, or generating shareable SVG route maps through a local Circulus Map setup.

## Hosted destination (next release)

- https://circulusmap.desk.travel/

## Quick start

- Before using tools, make sure the local app is running with `npm run dev` and the MCP worker is running with `npm run mcp:dev`.
- Expect the local MCP endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp`.
- For simple requests, call `map.solve_query` with shorthand input like `JFK-LHR` or `800nm@DEN`.
- For advanced requests, build a `MapSpecV1` object and call `map.solve_spec`.
- Use `map.search_locations` before solving when the user is unsure about codes or city names.
- Use `map.get_airport` when you need a single airport record with coordinates and runway metadata.
- Use `map.render_svg` only after the route/spec is stable.

## Tool selection

- `map.search_locations`: best first step for ambiguous airport/city input.
- `map.solve_query`: fastest path for route-only requests and simple range rings.
- `map.solve_spec`: use when the user cares about projection, ETOPS, labels, markers, or multiple paths.
- `map.list_scenarios`: use when the user asks for examples or wants a starting point.
- `map.render_svg`: use for final export-ready output, not exploration.

## Resources

- Read `circulus://mapspec/schema` before authoring a non-trivial `MapSpecV1`.
- Read `circulus://projection/guide` for projection choices.
- Read `circulus://scenario/catalog` and `circulus://api/examples` when you need examples quickly.

## References

- For local setup details and offline packaging expectations, read [references/local-setup.md](references/local-setup.md).
- For quick query and spec-writing guidance, read [references/mapspec.md](references/mapspec.md).
- For sample payloads, inspect `assets/examples` when bundled with this skill package.

## Guardrails

- Stay within the MCP tool surface; do not invent unsupported write operations.
- Do not ask the MCP server to proxy arbitrary URLs or tile providers.
- Prefer `map.solve_query` over `map.solve_spec` unless explicit control is needed.
- If the local MCP server is unreachable, help the user restore the local app and worker before retrying tool calls.
