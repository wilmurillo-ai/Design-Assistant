# Pages: Legal

Guides legal page content, structure, and SEO handling.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

Identify:
1. **Page type**: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy, etc.
2. **Jurisdiction**: GDPR, CCPA, etc.
3. **Business model**: SaaS, e-commerce, content site
4. **Indexing**: Index or noindex (often noindex for legal)

## Common Legal Pages

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Privacy Policy** | Data collection, use, sharing, rights |
| **Terms of Service** | User agreement, limitations, termination |
| **Cookie Policy** | Cookie types, consent, management |
| **Acceptable Use** | Prohibited uses, enforcement |
| **Refund Policy** | Refund conditions (e-commerce) |

## Best Practices

### Content

- **Clear language**: Avoid legalese where possible
- **Structure**: Headings, sections, table of contents
- **Updates**: Date of last update; version if needed
- **Legal review**: Have lawyer review for compliance

### SEO

| Approach | When |
|----------|------|
| **Index** | If you want legal pages discoverable (rare) |
| **Noindex** | Common for legal; reduces low-value indexed pages |
| **Canonical** | If multiple versions (e.g., by region) |

### Placement

- Footer links to all legal pages
- Consent flows (cookie banner) link to Privacy/Cookie Policy
- Sign-up/checkout link to Terms

## Structure

- **Privacy Policy**: What data, why, how long, rights, contact
- **Terms**: Acceptance, use, IP, liability, termination, governing law
- **Cookie Policy**: Types, purposes, how to manage

## Output Format

- **Outline** for each legal page type
- **Section** structure and key points
- **SEO** recommendation (index vs. noindex)
- **Footer** link placement
- **Disclaimer**: Recommend legal review
