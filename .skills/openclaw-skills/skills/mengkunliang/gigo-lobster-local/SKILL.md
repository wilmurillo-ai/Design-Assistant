# gigo-lobster-local

## Mission

- 本地模式：跑完整评测，但不上云、不注册个人结果页，证书二维码回到官网首页。
- Local-only mode: runs the benchmark without uploading, without creating a personal result page, and keeps the certificate QR code pointed at the site homepage.

## Trigger Phrases

- 中文：本地试吃龙虾 / 离线试吃龙虾 / 只在本地评测龙虾 / 龙虾本地模式
- English: local lobster taste / offline lobster taste / run lobster locally / local lobster eval

## Execution Rules

1. Use a direct Python command on this skill directory's wrapper file. Never use `cd ... && python ...`; OpenClaw preflight may reject it.
2. Prefer `python3`, then `python`, then `py`.
3. If the user asked in Chinese, append `--lang zh`. If the user asked in English, append `--lang en`.
4. Stream short progress updates while the benchmark is running.
5. Keep stdout/stderr visible and remind the user that the full log is written to `gigo-run.log`.
6. Do not run `--help`, inspect the whole repo, or switch to `main.py` once the wrapper command is clear. Start the wrapper directly.
7. If the wrapper starts a long-running process, do not kill it just because stdout is quiet for a while. A full tasting run often takes 15-25 minutes.
8. While a long run is in progress, monitor the process and tail the log file under `~/.openclaw/workspace/outputs/gigo-lobster-local/gigo-run.log` instead of improvising a second execution path.
9. Only declare failure if the process exits non-zero, the log shows a traceback, or the user explicitly asks to cancel.
10. Stay attached until the wrapper exits. Do not end the conversation with “I will keep monitoring”; keep polling and only report completion once you have the final score/result files/ref_code (if any).
11. Prefer `process poll` plus `exec tail -n 50 .../gigo-run.log` while monitoring. Do not use a generic full-file `read` on `gigo-run.log`, because the log can be large and may break the chat output.

## Default Behavior

- 中文：默认只在本地生成报告与证书，不上传云端。
- English: By default it keeps everything local and does not upload to the cloud.

## Recommended Command Shape

```bash
python3 /absolute/path/to/run_local.py --lang zh
```

If the user explicitly asks for overrides, append the matching CLI flags:

- `--lobster-name "..."` and `--lobster-tags "tag1,tag2"` for a custom lobster persona
- `--output-dir /custom/path` for a custom output directory
- `--require-png-cert` when the user refuses the SVG fallback
- `--skip-upload` or `--register-only` only when the user explicitly asks to change the default upload behavior

## Persona Defaults

- Prefer `SOUL.md` first
- Then read `GIGO_LOBSTER_NAME` and `GIGO_LOBSTER_TAGS`
- Finally accept explicit CLI overrides

Do not stop for interactive questions unless the user explicitly asks for an interactive run.
