# gigo-lobster-doctor

## Mission

- 环境体检模式：只检查 gateway、Python 依赖、题包链路与 PNG 证书能力，不跑正式试吃。
- Environment doctor mode: checks the gateway, Python/runtime dependencies, task-bundle access, and PNG certificate readiness without running the full benchmark.

## Trigger Phrases

- 中文：龙虾体检 / 检查龙虾环境 / 先体检龙虾 / 龙虾环境检查
- English: lobster doctor / check lobster environment / lobster environment check / doctor my lobster

## Execution Rules

1. Use a direct Python command on this skill directory's wrapper file. Never use `cd ... && python ...`; OpenClaw preflight may reject it.
2. Prefer `python3`, then `python`, then `py`.
3. If the user asked in Chinese, append `--lang zh`. If the user asked in English, append `--lang en`.
4. Stream short progress updates while the benchmark is running.
5. Keep stdout/stderr visible and remind the user that the full log is written to `gigo-run.log`.
6. Do not run `--help`, inspect the whole repo, or switch to `main.py` once the wrapper command is clear. Start the wrapper directly.
7. If the wrapper starts a long-running process, do not kill it just because stdout is quiet for a while. A full tasting run often takes 15-25 minutes.
8. While a long run is in progress, monitor the process and tail the log file under `~/.openclaw/workspace/outputs/gigo-lobster-doctor/gigo-run.log` instead of improvising a second execution path.
9. Only declare failure if the process exits non-zero, the log shows a traceback, or the user explicitly asks to cancel.
10. Stay attached until the wrapper exits. Do not end the conversation with “I will keep monitoring”; keep polling and only report completion once you have the final score/result files/ref_code (if any).
11. Prefer `process poll` plus `exec tail -n 50 .../gigo-run.log` while monitoring. Do not use a generic full-file `read` on `gigo-run.log`, because the log can be large and may break the chat output.

## Default Behavior

- 中文：默认只做环境检查，不跑正式 benchmark，也不会上传。
- English: By default it only runs the environment checks. No full benchmark and no upload.

## Recommended Command Shape

```bash
python3 /absolute/path/to/run_doctor.py --lang zh
```

If the user explicitly asks for overrides, append the matching CLI flags:

- `--lobster-name "..."` and `--lobster-tags "tag1,tag2"` for a custom lobster persona
- `--output-dir /custom/path` for a custom output directory
- `--require-png-cert` when the user refuses the SVG fallback
- `--skip-upload` or `--register-only` only when the user explicitly asks to change the default upload behavior

## Persona Defaults

- Prefer `SOUL.md` first
- Then read `GIGO_LOBSTER_NAME` and `GIGO_LOBSTER_TAGS`
- Finally accept explicit CLI overrides

Do not stop for interactive questions unless the user explicitly asks for an interactive run.
