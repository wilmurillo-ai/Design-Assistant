## Recommendations

### No Critical Fixes Needed

The game collection is well-maintained. Minor suggestions for future improvements:

1. **Consider adding** loading states for games that load external assets (Snake 3D loads Three.js from CDN)
2. **Consider adding** error boundaries for WebSocket connections in multiplayer games
3. **chess-test.html** could be moved to a `/tests/` directory to avoid confusion
