## The Core Problem This Solves

**Too dry** = Brand-compliant but boring (my old approach)
**Too wild** = Creative but off-brand

This skill finds the sweet spot: **Creative intelligence within structure.**

---

## Prompt Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Mode

| Mode | Purpose | Visual Energy | CTA? |
|------|---------|---------------|------|
| **Orientation** | Explain what we are | Calm, structural | No |
| **Understanding** | Teach how it works | Clear, demonstrative | No |
| **Thinking** | Share worldview (60-70%) | Contemplative, evocative | No |
| **Action** | Drive conversion (max 20%) | Focused, direct | Yes, one only |

### Step 2: Apply Brand Constraints

**Always True:**
- One typeface: Inter (or similar clean sans-serif)
- One accent color: #2563EB (Interactive Blue)
- Background: #FAFAFA (Canvas) or #FFFFFF (Surface)
- Text: #171717 (primary) / #525252 (secondary)
- Max 3 type sizes per composition
- Creative Variable ≤ 40% of area
- Hierarchy through size/weight, not color

**Never Allowed:**
- Decorative gradients
- Multiple saturated colors
- Red/gold traditional palettes (unless explicitly requested for cultural context)
- Hype verbs in text overlays
- Confetti, fireworks, busy patterns
- Bold (700) weight
- Multiple CTAs

### Step 3: Add Creative Dimensions

This is where we transform "dry" into "alive" — without breaking brand rules.

## Example Prompts by Mode

### Mode 3: Thinking (Social Content)

**Brief:** LinkedIn post about AI and brand consistency

```
Thought leadership visual for LinkedIn.

Art direction inspired by Hiroshi Sugimoto's Seascapes and Swiss International Style.

Central composition: Abstract horizon line — a subtle gradient transition from deep charcoal (#171717) at bottom to soft light at top, with a single thin horizontal line in Interactive Blue (#2563EB) suggesting a threshold or horizon.

No text overlay — image only.

Background: Clean off-white (#FAFAFA) with barely perceptible paper texture. 70% negative space.

Lighting: Soft ambient glow along the horizon line, like dawn breaking. Diffused, no harsh shadows.

Mood: Contemplative, forward-looking, the quiet moment before clarity arrives.

Technical: Medium format aesthetic, subtle film grain, matte finish.

Avoid: Busy patterns, multiple colors, gradients, tech clichés (circuits, robots, blue glowing things), stock photo feel.
```

### Mode 4: Action (Campaign)

**Brief:** CTA banner for free trial

```
Conversion banner for website hero section.

Art direction inspired by Apple product photography and Kinfolk editorial design.

Central composition: Clean product interface mockup (abstract representation) floating with subtle shadow, positioned left using rule of thirds. Right side reserved for CTA.

Typography: "See your brand, computed." in charcoal (#171717), semibold, left-aligned. Single CTA button in Interactive Blue (#2563EB) with white text "Start Free".

Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with subtle depth created by soft shadows.

Lighting: Clean product lighting, soft box from above-left, gentle ambient fill.

Mood: Professional, inviting, zero friction. The confidence of showing rather than telling.

Technical: Crisp 4K render aesthetic, no grain, clean edges.

Avoid: Multiple CTAs, busy backgrounds, decorative elements, hype text, gradients.
```

### Mode 1: Orientation (Homepage)

**Brief:** Hero image explaining what CanMarket is

```
Homepage hero visual explaining Brand Operating System concept.

Art direction inspired by Bauhaus geometric abstraction and Tadao Ando's use of light and concrete.

Central composition: Abstract architectural form — clean geometric shapes (rectangles, subtle curves) arranged to suggest "system" or "structure" — in warm near-black (#18181B) with one element highlighted in Interactive Blue (#2563EB). Shapes cast soft shadows creating depth.

Background: Warm off-white (#FAFAFA) with subtle texture suggesting quality paper or concrete.

Lighting: Dramatic but soft — like sunlight entering a minimal concrete space through a single skylight. Creates clear shadows that define the geometric forms.

Mood: Intelligent, structural, inviting. "This is a thinking space."

Technical: Architectural photography aesthetic, medium format clarity, very slight warm tone.

Avoid: Illustrations, icons, stock imagery, multiple colors, decorative elements, busy compositions.
```

## Quick Reference: Brand-Safe Creative Elements

### Colors You CAN Use Creatively
- Gradients within grayscale (#FAFAFA → #171717)
- Interactive Blue as accent (≤15% of area)
- Subtle warm or cool tints to white/gray (very subtle)

### Shapes/Forms That Work
- Clean geometric forms (circles, rectangles, lines)
- Architectural abstractions
- Light-based effects (glows, soft shadows)
- Negative space as design element
- Subtle gradients (grayscale or light-to-blue)

### Textures That Work
- Paper/matte textures
- Subtle film grain
- Concrete/stone (for grounded feel)
- Frosted glass effects
- Soft fabric hints

### What Makes It "CanMarket"
Even without a logo, the image should feel like CanMarket:
- Generous breathing room
- One accent color only
- Calm, not loud
- Structured, not chaotic
- Premium, not cheap
- Warm minimal, not cold minimal

---

## Negative Prompts Library

Always exclude these for brand consistency:

```
blurry, low quality, artifacts, text watermarks, signatures,
decorative gradients, rainbow colors, neon, glitch effects,
confetti, fireworks, sparkles, lens flares,
busy patterns, cluttered composition,
stock photo aesthetic, corporate clip art,
robots, AI brain imagery, circuit boards, blue glowing tech clichés,
red and gold traditional, overly festive,
multiple bright colors, color explosion,
bold heavy fonts, all caps aggressive text,
cheap plastic textures, glossy reflections
```

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Midjourney
- Use `--ar 1:1` for social, `--ar 16:9` for banners
- Add `--style raw` for less AI-stylized results
- Use `--s 50-150` for balanced stylization

### DALL-E / ChatGPT
- Paragraph-form descriptions work best
- Can iterate: "Keep composition, make lighting warmer"
- Specify "no text" if you don't want text rendered

### Stable Diffusion
- Use negative prompts explicitly
- Weighted terms: `(Interactive Blue:1.2)`
- Specify model/checkpoint for consistent style

---

### Example 4: Pitch Deck Visual

**User Input:**
> "pitch deck 需要一个表示 'Brand Memory' 概念的抽象图"

**Expected Output:**
```
## Mode: Orientation (Explanation)

## Prompt:

Abstract visual representing "Brand Memory" concept for pitch deck.

Art direction inspired by James Turrell's light installations and Bauhaus geometric abstraction.

Central composition: Layered geometric forms suggesting depth and accumulation — like sedimentary layers or stacked transparent planes. Forms progress from lighter at top to darker at bottom, suggesting "memory building over time." One layer highlighted with subtle Interactive Blue (#2563EB) glow, representing the "active" memory layer.

No text — pure visual metaphor.

Background: Deep charcoal (#171717) to near-black, allowing the geometric forms to emerge with internal luminosity.

Lighting: Forms appear to emit soft internal glow rather than being lit externally. Ethereal, like light trapped within material. Rim lighting on edges creates definition.

Mood: Intelligent, structural, slightly mysterious. Invites the question "what is this?" which the presenter then answers.

Technical: High-end 3D render aesthetic, subtle depth of field, medium format clarity. No grain for this use case — clean and precise.

Avoid: Literal representations (brains, filing cabinets, databases), tech clichés, busy compositions, multiple bright colors, decorative elements.
