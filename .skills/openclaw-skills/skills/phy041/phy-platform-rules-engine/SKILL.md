description: Social media pre-flight checker. Scans any draft post against 30+ platform-specific invisible rules and outputs PASS/WARN/FAIL per rule with exact fix suggestions. Like a linter for content. Covers Reddit (90/10 self-promo ratio, shadowban triggers, link-to-comment tracking), LinkedIn (360Brew AI detection, 60% external link penalty, engagement bait NLP filter, engagement pod detection), Twitter/X (150x author-reply multiplier, 30-min velocity window, link depression since March 2026, bookmark 10x signal), and HackerNews (Show HN format rules, tutorial downrank, clickbait title editing by dang). Research-backed with specific algorithm data. Zero external dependencies.

# phy-platform-rules-engine — Social Media Pre-Flight Checker

Each social platform has invisible rules. Break them and you get shadowbanned, de-ranked, or ignored — without knowing why. This tool scans your draft post against 30+ platform-specific rules before you publish.

**Like a linter, but for social media posts.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check a Reddit post
echo "Your post text" | python3 ~/.claude/skills/phy-platform-rules-engine/scripts/platform_rules.py --platform reddit

# Check a LinkedIn post from file
python3 ~/.claude/skills/phy-platform-rules-engine/scripts/platform_rules.py --file draft.txt --platform linkedin

# Check a Twitter/X thread
python3 ~/.claude/skills/phy-platform-rules-engine/scripts/platform_rules.py --text "My tweet..." --platform twitter

# Check a HackerNews submission
python3 ~/.claude/skills/phy-platform-rules-engine/scripts/platform_rules.py --text "Show HN: ..." --platform hackernews

# JSON output
python3 ~/.claude/skills/phy-platform-rules-engine/scripts/platform_rules.py --file draft.txt --platform linkedin --format json
```
