This skill is pinned to Hookaido `v2.2.2` and keeps existing inbound/outbound/pull workflows as the default path.
New capabilities such as `deliver exec` (subprocess delivery), provider-compatible HMAC (GitHub/Gitea), `queue postgres`, gRPC pull workers, batch `ack`/`nack`, and release verification are documented as additive modules so existing usage does not receive breaking changes by default.

Main files:

- `scripts/install_hookaido.sh` for pinned release-binary installation with SHA256 verification
