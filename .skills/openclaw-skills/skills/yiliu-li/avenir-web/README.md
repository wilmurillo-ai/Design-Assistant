## Abstract

Avenir-Web is an autonomous web agent framework designed for reliable execution of long-horizon tasks on complex, dynamic web interfaces. Addressing challenges in element grounding and long-term task tracking, it introduces a modular architecture combining Mixture of Grounding Experts (MoGE), Experience-Imitation Planning (EIP), and Adaptive Memory with Task-Tracking Checklists. This approach establishes a new open-source state-of-the-art on the Online-Mind2Web benchmark, bridging the performance gap with proprietary models in real-world deployments.

## News

- **2026-03-05**: Added repository-level `SKILL.md` to define the Avenir-Web agent skill workflow (mode selection, instruction design, single/batch execution, API requirements, and reporting contract).

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python `3.11` (recommended; `>=3.9` supported)
- Playwright browsers (Chromium recommended)
- A model provider API key (OpenRouter preferred)

From the repository root:

```bash
conda create -n avenir-web python=3.11
conda activate avenir-web
pip install -e src
python -m playwright install chromium
```

## API Keys

Recommended (environment variable):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Or set it in `src/config/batch_experiment.toml` under `[api_keys]` (`openrouter_api_key = "..."`). Environment variables take precedence.

## Quickstart

### Reproduce the Example Batch Run

The example configuration runs a batch from `data/example.json` and writes artifacts to the directory configured by `basic.save_file_dir` in `src/config/batch_experiment.toml`.

```bash
cd src
python run_agent.py -c config/batch_experiment.toml
```

### Single-Task Convenience Script

From the repository root:

```bash
python example.py --task "Find the official API docs for X" --website "https://example.com/"
```

## Agent Skill (SKILL.md)

This repository now includes a dedicated skill specification at [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md).

The skill defines how an agent should:
- choose run mode (`headless`, `headed`, `demo`)
- write high-quality task instructions
- run single-task and batch workflows consistently
- handle API key requirements (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` first, TOML fallback)
- report outcomes with evidence and next-step recommendations

If you are using an agentic coding assistant that supports skills, point it to this file as the canonical operating guide for Avenir-Web runs.


## Demo Mode

Avenir-Web features a specialized **Demo Mode** designed for high-quality screen recordings and live presentations. When enabled, the agent provides:

- **Cursor Visuals**: A GPU-accelerated, dynamic cursor overlay with tech-minimalist light effects and clear click/keypress feedback.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: A native GUI window synchronized with the browser, displaying the agent's current strategy, task progress, and live status.
- **Visual Feedback**: Reaction-based animations (e.g., impact ripples, shockwaves) that make the agent's decision-making process transparent and engaging.

To enable Demo Mode, ensure `browser.mode = "demo"` is set in your configuration.

## Outputs and Artifacts

For each task, outputs are written under `basic.save_file_dir/<task_id>/` (configured in TOML):

- `agent.log`: per-task execution log
- `result.json`: final summary
- `config.toml`: resolved config snapshot
- `llm_records.json`: recorded LLM I/O
- `screenshots/`: `screen_<step>.png`

Runner-level logs are written under `src/logs/`.

## Configuration (TOML)

The primary configuration entry point is `src/config/batch_experiment.toml`:

- `[basic]`: output directory (`save_file_dir`)
- `[model]`: model name, temperature, and (optional) specialist models (e.g., checklist/strategist)
- `[api_keys]`: API keys (environment variables still take precedence)
- `[experiment]`: task file path, overwrite policy, max operations
- `[playwright]`: headless/headful, viewport, geolocation

## Troubleshooting

- Missing API key: set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (preferred) or configure `[api_keys]`
- Playwright browser not found: run `python -m playwright install chromium`
- Config paths look wrong: run from `src/` or pass an absolute path to `-c`
