# CUCHD Staff Portal Login

Login URL: `https://staff.cuchd.in`

The login form is a **two-step process**. The password field is hidden until after the username is submitted and the page reloads.

```

- Click the **Next** button (may be labelled "Next", "Continue", or similar)

```
browser: click the Next / Continue button
```

### Step 3 — Wait for page reload

The page will reload or update dynamically. The password field is **not visible before this step** — wait until the new state is fully loaded before proceeding.
