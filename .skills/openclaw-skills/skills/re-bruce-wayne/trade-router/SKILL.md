  Solana swap execution, MEV-protected transaction submission, wallet scanning, and market-cap-based
  limit/trailing orders via the TradeRouter API. Use when the user wants to: swap SPL tokens on Solana
  (buy or sell), check wallet token holdings, submit signed transactions through an MEV-protected
  priority lane, place limit orders (buy/sell at a target market cap), set trailing stop orders
  (trailing_sell/trailing_buy), place combo orders (limit+TWAP, trailing+TWAP, limit+trailing,
  limit+trailing+TWAP), manage existing orders (check, list, cancel, extend), or implement
  DCA strategies. No API key required — wallet address is the only identity. Supports REST endpoints
  POST /swap, POST /holdings, POST /protect, and WebSocket wss://api.traderouter.ai/ws for limit orders.

# TradeRouter

Solana swap builder and limit-order engine.

**Base URL:** `https://api.traderouter.ai`
**WebSocket:** `wss://api.traderouter.ai/ws`
**Website:** https://traderouter.ai
**Auth:** None. No API key. Wallet address is the only identity.
**Content-Type:** All REST requests require `Content-Type: application/json`.

---

## Before you use this skill

**Maintaining the WebSocket connection:** Limit orders, trailing orders, and order management (cancel, extend, list) require an **open WebSocket connection** to `wss://api.traderouter.ai/ws`. The server delivers `order_filled` only over that connection — if the client disconnects, it will not receive fills until it reconnects and re-registers. Keep the WS connection alive for the lifetime of any active limit/trailing orders so you can receive and execute fills. On disconnect, reconnect and re-register (see Reconnection); active orders persist server-side.

**Authentication for order management:** WebSocket order placement and cancellation are gated by a **challenge–response flow**: the server sends a challenge with a nonce; the client must **sign the nonce** with the wallet’s private key (Ed25519) and send `register` with `wallet_address` and the base58 signature. Only after the server responds with `registered` and `authenticated: true` can the client place or cancel orders. Authorization is **proof-of-control** of the wallet via the signed challenge — no separate API key.

**Service origin:** This skill documents the API only. The service website is **https://traderouter.ai** (API at api.traderouter.ai).

**MEV protection:** The `POST /protect` endpoint accepts signed transactions and uses **Jito** and a **staked connection lane** to process your transaction.

**Risk:** No API key is requested; identity is the wallet address (and for WebSocket orders, proof via the signed challenge).

## POST /swap — Build unsigned swap transaction

Returns an **unsigned** transaction (base58). Client must sign it, then submit via `POST /protect`.

**Sell uses `holdings_percentage` (bps). Buy uses `amount` (lamports). Never mix them.**

### Request

```json
{
  "wallet_address": "SOLANA_PUBKEY",
  "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
  "action": "buy",
  "amount": 100000000,
  "slippage": 1500
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| wallet_address | string | yes | Solana pubkey |
| token_address | string | yes | SPL token mint address |
| action | string | yes | `"buy"` or `"sell"` |
| amount | integer | buy only | Lamports. **Only for buy.** |
| holdings_percentage | integer | sell only | Bps (10000 = 100%). **Only for sell.** |
| slippage | integer | no | Bps, default 500 (5%). **For low-liquidity or newly launched tokens, use 1500-2500 bps.** 500 bps will often fail on memecoins. |

If both `amount` and `holdings_percentage` are sent, treat the request as invalid. The reference client blocks this locally via schema validation before network calls, and the API should return 422 for malformed payloads.

### Success response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "swap_tx": "<base58_unsigned_transaction>",
    "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
    "pool_type": "raydium",
    "pool_address": "POOL_PUBKEY",
    "amount_in": 100000000,
    "min_amount_out": 950000,
    "price_impact": 0.5,
    "slippage": 1500,
    "decimals": 6
  }
}
```

`pool_type` tells you which DEX the swap routes through (e.g. `raydium`, `pumpswap`, `orca`, `meteora`). Treat this field as an open enum and handle unknown values gracefully.

### Error response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Insufficient balance",
  "code": 400
}
```

`code` is optional. Common: 422 (validation), 400 (bad request).

**"Error running simulation"** is usually an unsellable route at that moment (dead/rugged pool, zero effective balance, or no valid route). Do not loop retries — place the token on cooldown and retry later only if strategy requires.

---

## POST /protect — Submit signed transaction (MEV protected)

Submit a **signed** transaction (**base64**). Blocks until confirmed on-chain. Returns signature and balance changes. Under the hood, the service uses **Jito** and a **staked connection lane** for MEV protection and submission.

**⚠️ Set a 30-second timeout on /protect calls.** This endpoint blocks until on-chain confirmation and can hang during network congestion.

**⚠️ Encoding mismatch:** `/swap` returns `swap_tx` as **base58**. `/protect` expects **base64**. You must convert — see the workflow section.

### Request

```json
{
  "signed_tx_base64": "<base64_signed_transaction>"
}
```

### Success response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "signature": "5kyc5dMF1tybDcj8sVMZz3fCLbHYDczZ7A4mMu5JMPz1...",
  "sol_balance_pre": 10399668919,
  "sol_balance_post": 10399538835,
  "token_balances": [
    {
      "mint": "FFKwi6dzaDmkGhtMDGKbt3HAyEYWk2BgwN4AwcWbbonk",
      "balance": 25952334242,
      "decimals": 6,
      "balance_change": 2032594114,
      "ui_amount_string": "25952.334242"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `sol_balance_post` and `token_balances` to update holdings after the swap.

### Error handling

- `{"status":"error","error":"message"}` — general error.
- **503** — protect endpoint not configured on server. `submitTx()` handles this automatically — falls back to direct RPC. You lose MEV protection but the transaction still goes through.
- **Timeout** — the tx may have landed on-chain. Check tx status via RPC before retrying.

---

## POST /holdings — Scan wallet token balances

Returns token holdings with liquid DEX pool info. **Set HTTP timeout to at least 100 seconds** — this endpoint scans all token accounts and can be slow.

### Request

```json
{
  "wallet_address": "SOLANA_PUBKEY"
}
```

### Response

Empty wallet: `{}`

Wallet with holdings:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
      "valueNative": 1500000000,
      "amount": 25952334242,
      "decimals": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

`/holdings` is intended to return sellable tokens, but keep a defensive `valueNative > MIN_VALUE_NATIVE` filter (default `0`, i.e. `valueNative > 0`) in case stale or edge-case entries appear. The reference client's `getHoldings()` applies this filter automatically.

---

## GET /mcap — Market cap data

Return market cap (and optional price/pool) for given token addresses.

**Request:** `GET https://api.traderouter.ai/mcap?tokens=MINT1,MINT2` (comma-delimited Solana mint addresses).

**Response:** Object keyed by token address. Each value can include `marketCap`, `pair_address`, `pool_type`, `priceUsd`. Empty object if no tokens provided or none found.

---

## GET /flex — Flex trade card PNG

Generate a flex trade card image for a wallet and token mint.

**Request:** `GET https://api.traderouter.ai/flex?wallet_address=WALLET&token_address=MINT`.

**Response:** `image/png`. 400 on invalid params; 501 if flex_card_image deps not available; 500 on server error.

---

## Instant swap workflow (step by step)

**The encoding changes: /swap returns base58, /protect expects base64.** Do not send base58 to /protect.

1. `POST /swap` with wallet_address, token_address, action, amount or holdings_percentage, slippage
2. Read `data.swap_tx` from response — this is **base58** encoded
3. **Decode** from base58 into raw bytes
4. **Deserialize** as VersionedTransaction
5. **Sign** with wallet private key
6. **Re-serialize** the signed transaction into bytes
7. **Encode** as **base64**
8. Submit via `submitTx(signedBase64)` — this calls `/protect` first (30s timeout), auto-falls back to RPC on 503
9. On success: `signature` = tx hash, use `sol_balance_post` and `token_balances` to update state
10. On timeout: `submitTx` checks if tx landed via RPC before falling back — no manual handling needed

---

## WebSocket — Limit and trailing orders

**URL:** `wss://api.traderouter.ai/ws`

**You must keep the WebSocket connection open** for limit and trailing orders to work: the server sends `order_filled` only over this connection. If the connection drops, you will not receive fills until you reconnect and re-register. Maintain the connection for as long as you have active orders that you want to receive and execute.

Server monitors market cap every ~5 seconds. When target is crossed, server pushes `order_filled` with an unsigned swap transaction to sign and submit.

**Reference implementation:** Follow the flow below (challenge → register with signature, verification of `order_filled` and `order_created`). Use the canonical payloads, params_hash encoding, and Ed25519 verification rules in this skill as the source of truth.

### Connection sequence (MUST follow this exact order)

The server sends a **challenge** on connect (not `subscribed`). Registration is **challenge–response only**; there is no unauthenticated path for placing orders.

1. Connect to `wss://api.traderouter.ai/ws`
2. **Server sends:** `{"type": "challenge", "nonce": "<nonce>", "message": "..."}`. The current protocol always sends `challenge` as the first message.
3. **Client:** Sign the **nonce** (UTF-8 bytes) with the **wallet's private key** (Ed25519). You **must** have the wallet private key to use the WebSocket for orders; without it you cannot register successfully.
4. **Client sends:** `{"action": "register", "wallet_address": "<SOLANA_PUBKEY>", "signature": "<base58>"}`. The signature is the base58-encoded result of signing the nonce. If you omit signature after a challenge, the server responds with `{"type": "error", "message": "Missing signature. Sign the challenge nonce and send register with wallet_address and signature."}` and you will not be authenticated.
5. **Server sends:** `{"type": "registered", "wallet_address": "<pubkey>", "authenticated": true}`.
6. **Only after** receiving `registered` with `authenticated: true` may you send order actions. Sending order actions before that returns `{"type": "error", "message": "Not authenticated. Register with a valid signature to place or manage orders."}`.

**Do NOT send any order actions before receiving `{"type": "registered", "authenticated": true}`.** Plain `{"action": "register", "wallet_address": "..."}` without a signature will **fail** when the server has sent a challenge.

### Reconnection

On WebSocket disconnect:
1. Reconnect to `wss://api.traderouter.ai/ws`
2. Server sends a new **challenge** (new nonce). Send `{"action": "register", "wallet_address": "...", "signature": "<base58 of nonce signed with wallet>"}`.
3. Wait for `{"type": "registered", "authenticated": true}`
4. Check for any pending `order_filled` messages
5. Use the staleness check (`triggered_mcap / filled_mcap < 0.85`) to skip stale fills

Active orders persist server-side — you do **not** need to re-place them after reconnect.

### Limit sell (take-profit or stop-loss)

```json
{
  "action": "sell",
  "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
  "holdings_percentage": 10000,
  "target": 20000,
  "slippage": 1500,
  "expiry_hours": 144
}
```

`target` (often named `targetMcapBps` in client code) is bps vs **current mcap at order placement time** (not your wallet entry price). Any value > 0. **Sell target > 10000** = take-profit (e.g. 20000 = mcap doubles). **Sell target < 10000** = stop-loss (e.g. 5000 = mcap halves).

### Limit buy (dip buy or breakout entry)

```json
{
  "action": "buy",
  "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
  "amount": 100000000,
  "target": 5000,
  "slippage": 1500,
  "expiry_hours": 144
}
```

`target` (often named `targetMcapBps` in client code) is bps vs **current mcap at order placement time** (not your wallet entry price). Any value > 0. **Buy target < 10000** = dip buy (e.g. 5000 = mcap halves). **Buy target > 10000** = breakout entry (e.g. 20000 = mcap doubles).

### Trailing sell / Trailing buy

```json
{
  "action": "trailing_sell",
  "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
  "holdings_percentage": 10000,
  "trail": 1000,
  "slippage": 1500,
  "expiry_hours": 144
}
```

`trail` is bps — percentage callback from peak before triggering.

**Example:** `trail: 1000` (10%). Token mcap peaks at $100k. Sell triggers when mcap drops to $90k (10% below peak). If mcap later peaks at $150k, the trigger moves up to $135k.

Replace `trailing_sell` with `trailing_buy` and `holdings_percentage` with `amount` for trailing buy. For trailing buy, the trigger works in reverse: if mcap bottoms at $50k, a 10% trail triggers when mcap rises to $55k.

### Limit + TWAP (limit_twap_sell / limit_twap_buy)

Wait for limit target (bps vs entry mcap), then execute via TWAP. Required: `token_address`, `target`, `frequency`, `duration`; for sell add `amount` or `holdings_percentage`; for buy add `amount`. When limit crosses, server spawns TWAP; client receives `limit_twap_triggered` then `twap_execution` per slice.

```json
{"action": "limit_twap_sell", "token_address": "MINT", "target": 20000, "frequency": 5, "duration": 3600, "holdings_percentage": 5000, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
{"action": "limit_twap_buy", "token_address": "MINT", "target": 5000, "amount": 100000000, "frequency": 5, "duration": 3600, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
```

### Trailing + TWAP (trailing_twap_sell / trailing_twap_buy)

When trailing stop triggers, server spawns TWAP. Required: `token_address`, `trail`, `frequency`, `duration`; for sell add `amount` or `holdings_percentage`; for buy add `amount`. Client receives `trailing_twap_triggered` then `twap_execution` per slice.

```json
{"action": "trailing_twap_sell", "token_address": "MINT", "trail": 1000, "frequency": 5, "duration": 3600, "holdings_percentage": 10000, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
{"action": "trailing_twap_buy", "token_address": "MINT", "trail": 1000, "amount": 100000000, "frequency": 5, "duration": 3600, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
```

### Limit + Trailing (limit_trailing_sell / limit_trailing_buy)

Wait for limit target, then trailing phase activates (server sends `limit_trailing_activated`). When the trailing stop triggers, single swap — client receives `order_filled` with `data.swap_tx`. Required: `token_address`, `target`, `trail`; for sell add `amount` or `holdings_percentage`; for buy add `amount`.

```json
{"action": "limit_trailing_sell", "token_address": "MINT", "target": 20000, "trail": 1000, "holdings_percentage": 10000, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
{"action": "limit_trailing_buy", "token_address": "MINT", "target": 5000, "trail": 1000, "amount": 100000000, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
```

### Limit + Trailing + TWAP (limit_trailing_twap_sell / limit_trailing_twap_buy)

Limit → trailing phase → when trail triggers, server spawns TWAP. Client receives `limit_trailing_activated` when trailing starts, then `limit_trailing_twap_triggered` when trail triggers, then `twap_execution` per slice. Required: `token_address`, `target`, `trail`, `frequency`, `duration`; for sell add `amount` or `holdings_percentage`; for buy add `amount`.

```json
{"action": "limit_trailing_twap_sell", "token_address": "MINT", "target": 20000, "trail": 1000, "frequency": 5, "duration": 3600, "holdings_percentage": 5000, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
{"action": "limit_trailing_twap_buy", "token_address": "MINT", "target": 5000, "trail": 1000, "amount": 100000000, "frequency": 5, "duration": 3600, "slippage": 500, "expiry_hours": 144}
```

### Order management actions

```json
{"action": "check_order", "order_id": "ORDER_ID"}
{"action": "list_orders"}
{"action": "cancel_order", "order_id": "ORDER_ID"}
{"action": "extend_order", "order_id": "ORDER_ID", "expiry_hours": 336}
```

### TWAP (time-weighted average price)

`twap_buy` and `twap_sell` split a total amount into `frequency` equal slices executed every `duration / frequency` seconds. `duration` is in seconds (min 60, max 30 days). There is no separate expiry — the order lives exactly `duration` seconds.

**twap_sell:** Either `amount` (raw token units) or `holdings_percentage` (bps, e.g. 5000 = 50%). If using `holdings_percentage`, the server resolves it once at order creation to a fixed token amount, then divides by `frequency` per slice.

```json
{
  "action": "twap_sell",
  "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
  "frequency": 5,
  "duration": 3600,
  "holdings_percentage": 5000,
  "slippage": 500
}
```

**twap_buy:** Use `amount` (SOL lamports) as total to spend over the duration.

```json
{
  "action": "twap_buy",
  "token_address": "SPL_TOKEN_MINT",
  "frequency": 5,
  "duration": 3600,
  "amount": 1000000000,
  "slippage": 500
}
```

**Server messages:** `twap_order_created` when accepted; `twap_execution` for each slice (includes `execution_num`, `executions_total`, `executions_remaining`, `next_execution_at`; when `status` is `success`, `data.swap_tx` and `server_signature` — verify signature then sign and submit like `order_filled`); `twap_order_completed` when all slices are done. On `cancel_order` for a TWAP order, server responds with `twap_order_cancelled`. Verify `twap_execution.server_signature` (same trust anchor as `order_filled`; MCP may use a dedicated signer for the twap slice payload) before signing/submitting each slice.

### Order expiry

Orders silently expire when `expiry_hours` is reached — **the server does not send an expiry event.** To detect expired orders, periodically call `check_order` or `list_orders`. Expired orders will no longer appear in results.

### All WebSocket actions reference

**expiry_hours:** default 144, max 336.

### Server → client message types

| type | Payload fields | Description |

| heartbeat | — | Keepalive, ignore |

### WebSocket authentication (required for orders)

The server sends a **challenge** with a **nonce** on connect. To place or manage orders you must:

1. Sign the **nonce** (as UTF-8 bytes) with the wallet's private key (Ed25519).
2. Send **one** message: `{"action": "register", "wallet_address": "<pubkey>", "signature": "<base58 signature>"}`. There is no separate `auth` action — the signature is sent in the same `register` message.
3. Wait for `{"type": "registered", "authenticated": true}`. Only then send order actions.

If you send `register` without `signature` after a challenge, the server responds with an error and does not set `authenticated: true`. Unauthenticated sessions cannot place or manage orders.

### Verifying server signatures (order_filled and order_created)

**Trust anchor — do not fetch from the server.** The server public key must be a **hardcoded or preconfigured** trust anchor. **Never** fetch it from the same server at runtime (e.g. GET /security) to verify that server's messages; that is a TOCTOU vulnerability. Use a hardcoded default and allow override via `TRADEROUTER_SERVER_PUBKEY` (base58). Use this key to verify all server signatures (Ed25519, base58 decode key and signature).

**Key rotation:** Support a second key via `TRADEROUTER_SERVER_PUBKEY_NEXT`. On verification failure with the current key, try the next key; if the next key succeeds, the server has rotated — update your primary key and treat the order as valid.

**Rejection when signature is required:** The server may require a valid `server_signature` on every `order_filled` (`TRADEROUTER_REQUIRE_SERVER_SIGNATURE`, default true). For `order_created`, clients can require a params commitment (`TRADEROUTER_REQUIRE_ORDER_CREATED_SIGNATURE`, default true); if required and the server omits `params_hash`/`server_signature`, reject the order. If signature is present but verification fails, reject the fill or order.

**order_filled.server_signature:** The server signs a **canonical JSON** payload. Build the payload from the message using only these keys (include a key only if present and not null): `order_id`, `order_type`, `status`, `token_address`, `entry_mcap`, `triggered_mcap`, `filled_mcap`, `target_mcap`, `triggered_at`, `filled_at`, `data`. Serialize with **sorted keys (recursive for nested objects)** and no extra whitespace, and **ensure_ascii** (escape non-ASCII as `\uXXXX`); e.g. Python: `json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=True)`; then SHA-256 of the UTF-8 bytes. The server's Ed25519 signature (base58) is over this digest. Verify with the server public key (base58 decode key and signature, verify digest with Ed25519). **Always verify before signing or submitting the fill.** If verification fails or `server_signature` is missing when the server is expected to send it, do not sign/submit. If `already_dispatched` is true, skip sign/submit (idempotent ack).

**order_created.server_signature (Rec 2):** When the server includes `params_hash` and `server_signature` in `order_created`, it is committing to the order parameters. The **params_hash** is the SHA-256 hex of a pipe-delimited canonical string: for limit orders `order_id|token_address|order_type|target_bps|slippage|expiry_hours|amount|holdings_percentage`; for trailing orders the same but `trail_bps` instead of `target_bps`. The server signs the digest SHA-256(params_hash_hex.encode("utf-8")). Verify with the server public key (base58 decode key and signature, verify digest with Ed25519). If present and verification fails, treat the order as untrusted. 
### Handling order_filled

When `order_filled` arrives:
1. **Idempotency:** If `already_dispatched` is true, skip sign/submit; treat as idempotent ack (fill was already sent). Log and exit.
2. **Verify:** Verify `server_signature` using the configured trust anchor (see "Verifying server signatures" above). On failure or if signature is missing when required, log and do not sign/submit.
3. Read `order_id` from the message — use for logging and correlation throughout
4. Read `data.swap_tx` — this is **base58** unsigned (when `already_dispatched` is false; when true, `data` or `data.swap_tx` may be omitted)
5. **Decode** from base58 into raw bytes
6. **Deserialize** as VersionedTransaction
7. **Sign** with client wallet
8. **Re-serialize** signed transaction into bytes
9. **Encode** as **base64**
10. Submit via `submitTx(signedBase64)` — handles /protect + fallback internally
11. Log `order_id` + `signature` together for audit trail
12. Use response to update holdings

**Idempotency:** Duplicate or late `order_filled` messages may have `already_dispatched: true` and no `data.swap_tx`; skip sign/submit and update local state only.

**Logging:** For each `order_filled`, log at least: received (order_id, order_type, token); if skipped (already_dispatched or verify failed) log reason; on submit log order_id + signature for audit.

**⚠️ `filled_mcap` can be 0 or null.** If `triggered_mcap` exists but `filled_mcap` is 0/null, the fill is still valid — the transaction will work, but mcap data at fill time is unreliable. Don't reject fills based on `filled_mcap` alone.

**Staleness check:** Apply to **every** `order_filled`, not only after reconnect. If `triggered_mcap` and `filled_mcap` are both present and **filled_mcap > 0**, and `triggered_mcap / filled_mcap < 0.85`, treat the fill as stale and consider skipping (do not sign/submit). **Divide-by-zero:** If `filled_mcap` is 0 or null, do not apply the ratio; the fill is not stale by this check. Proceed with verification and sign/submit as normal.

### `holdings_percentage` resolves at execution time

For limit sell and trailing sell orders, `holdings_percentage` is calculated **when the order triggers**, not when placed. If you sell 50% of a token via instant swap, a pending order with `holdings_percentage: 10000` (100%) will sell 100% of the *remaining* balance, not the original amount. This is a feature — it accounts for partial sells between placement and execution.

---

## DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)

DCA is implemented as repeated limit buy orders. It is **not automatic chaining** — each fill requires agent action:

1. Place a `buy` order via WebSocket with the desired `amount` and `target`
2. When `order_filled` arrives, sign the `swap_tx` and submit via `submitTx()` (follow the base58→base64 steps above)
3. After successful submission, place the **next** `buy` order
4. Repeat for as many intervals as desired

The server does not auto-chain orders. Each fill triggers `order_filled`, the agent must sign + submit, then explicitly place the next order.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| /holdings times out | Set HTTP timeout to at least 100 seconds. |
| /protect hangs | Set a 30s timeout. On timeout, check tx status via RPC before retrying — tx may have landed. |
| /protect returns 503 | `submitTx()` auto-falls back to RPC. No manual action needed. |
| 422 from /swap | Invalid payload (missing fields or mixed buy/sell params). Sell needs: wallet_address, token_address, action, holdings_percentage. Buy needs: wallet_address, token_address, action, amount. |
| "Error running simulation" from /swap | Route is unsellable now (dead/rugged pool, zero effective balance, or route failure). Put token on cooldown; avoid tight retry loops. |
| Swap fails on-chain | Increase slippage (1500-2500 bps for memecoins), check SOL balance for fees, verify token/pool exists. |
| No order_filled received | Verify register was sent, `{"type":"registered"}` received, and `authenticated: true` is set. A session that registered without a valid signature will receive `registered` with `authenticated: false` and will not receive fills — check this field first. Wallet must match. |
| WebSocket disconnects | Reconnect, re-register with signature, check for pending fills. Active orders persist server-side. |
| Sell fails on token from /holdings | Keep defensive filter `valueNative > MIN_VALUE_NATIVE` (`> 0` by default) and verify balance/pool just before sell. |
| filled_mcap is 0 or null | Fill is still valid. Execute normally — mcap data is unreliable but tx works. |
| Order seems to have disappeared | Orders silently expire at `expiry_hours`. Use `list_orders` to check. |

---

## Request pacing / rate limits

No hard limits are documented in this skill. Use conservative client pacing defaults unless the API owner gives stricter numbers:

- REST (`/swap`, `/protect`, `/holdings`): target <= 2 requests/sec sustained per wallet (short bursts <= 5).
- WebSocket mutating actions (`buy`, `sell`, `trailing_*`, `cancel_order`, `extend_order`): target <= 5 messages/sec per wallet.
- On 429 or repeated 5xx: exponential backoff with jitter (1s, 2s, 4s, cap 30s).
- Never tight-loop retries on the same token after `"Error running simulation"`; honor cooldown first.

---

## Important rules

- **No API key needed.** Wallet address is the only identity.
- **Never expose private keys.** Sign only in a secure client environment.
- **Keep WebSocket connection open for limit/trailing orders.** Fills are delivered only over the open WS; disconnect means you miss fills until you reconnect and re-register.
- **Register with signature on WebSocket.** Server sends challenge; sign nonce and send register with wallet_address + signature. No orders before `{"type":"registered","authenticated":true}`.
- **Sell = holdings_percentage. Buy = amount.** Do not mix these parameters.
- **Target basis:** WS `target` is relative to **current mcap at order placement**, not to your wallet entry price.
- **Encoding: /swap returns base58, /protect expects base64.** Decode → deserialize → sign → serialize → encode base64.
- **Slippage:** Default 500 (5%). **Use 1500-2500 bps for low-liquidity or newly launched tokens.** 500 bps will fail on most memecoins.
- **Set timeouts:** 30s on /protect, 100s on /holdings.
- **All transactions from the API are unsigned.** Client always signs.
- **Always submit via `submitTx()`.** This function enforces /protect first for MEV protection. RPC fallback is internal and only fires on 503 or timeout. **Never call `connection.sendRawTransaction()` directly.**
- **Unsellable routes:** "Error running simulation" should trigger cooldown, not spam retries.
- **Holdings filtering:** Keep `valueNative > MIN_VALUE_NATIVE` (`> 0` by default) as a defensive guard before sells. The reference client's `getHoldings()` does this automatically.
- **Order expiry is silent.** Server does not notify. Poll `list_orders` to detect.

---

## Definition of Done

An agent is production-ready only when it can execute all of the following with **zero manual steps**:

- [ ] **Instant buy:** `POST /swap` (buy) → decode base58 → sign → encode base64 → `submitTx()` → verify signature
- [ ] **Instant sell:** `POST /holdings` → defensive filter `valueNative > MIN_VALUE_NATIVE` (`> 0` by default) → `POST /swap` (sell) → sign → `submitTx()`
- [ ] **WebSocket limit order:** connect → challenge → register with signature → registered → place sell order → receive `order_filled` → verify → sign → `submitTx()`
- [ ] **WebSocket trailing order:** connect → challenge → register with signature → registered → place `trailing_sell` → receive `order_filled` → verify → sign → `submitTx()`
- [ ] **TWAP order:** connect → register → place `twap_sell` or `twap_buy` (frequency, duration, amount or holdings_percentage) → receive `twap_execution` for each slice → verify server_signature → sign → `submitTx()` for each; receive `twap_order_completed` when done
- [ ] **DCA cycle:** place buy order → handle fill → `submitTx()` → place next buy order
- [ ] **Reconnection:** disconnect → reconnect → new challenge → re-register with signature → handle pending fills with staleness check (all fills)
- [ ] **Error handling:** gracefully handle unsellable routes, 503, timeouts, stale fills, expired orders
- [ ] **Preflight checks pass:** env loaded, wallet accessible, RPC reachable, WS registration succeeds

## Canonical Stack

**Reference implementation:** The skill text above is the source of truth for WebSocket challenge–response, verification, and params_hash. Python clients can use: `solders` (Keypair, VersionedTransaction), `websockets`, `httpx`, `cryptography` (Ed25519), `base58`.

**Node.js (skill examples):** Pin these versions unless explicitly tested.

```
Runtime:    Node.js 20 LTS
crypto:     built-in (createHash for SHA-256; no npm install)
web3.js:    @solana/web3.js@1.95.8
bs58:       bs58@6.0.0
ws:         ws@8.18.0
ajv:        ajv@8.17.1
tweetnacl:  tweetnacl@1.0.3
```

```bash
npm init -y
npm pkg set type=module
npm install @solana/web3.js@1.95.8 bs58@6.0.0 ws@8.18.0 ajv@8.17.1 tweetnacl@1.0.3
```

**The `type=module` line is required.** All code below uses ESM imports and top-level await, which fail under CommonJS.

**Python:** `solders`, `websockets`, `httpx`, `cryptography`, `base58`. Encoding and verification logic are identical across runtimes; only library names differ.

---

## Reference Client

Minimal copy-paste implementation. **Everything is in this one code block** — safety guards, logging, kill switch, dry-run gating. There are no separate code blocks to wire in. The reference client uses `ajv` to validate requests before sending them. The inline schemas enforce the minimum required fields for each call; the Request/Response Schemas section below has the full payload definitions.

**One submission function:** All transactions go through `submitTx()`. This function tries `/protect` first (MEV-protected), and only falls back to direct RPC on 503 or timeout. There is no separate RPC submission function — the fallback is internal. **Never call `connection.sendRawTransaction()` directly.**

## Signing / Encoding Test Vectors

Use these to verify your signing pipeline produces valid output.

### Test: base58 decode → sign → base64 encode

```
Input swap_tx (base58):
  (any valid base58 string from /swap response)

Expected pipeline:
  bs58.decode(swap_tx)           → Uint8Array (raw bytes)
  VersionedTransaction.deserialize(bytes)  → tx object (check: tx.message exists)
  tx.sign([wallet])              → void (modifies tx in place, fills signature slots)
  tx.serialize()                 → Uint8Array (same length — signature slots are pre-allocated)
  Buffer.from(bytes).toString('base64') → string (starts with alphanumeric, contains +/=)

Self-check assertions:
  1. Decoded bytes length > 0
  2. tx.message exists (versioned tx from TradeRouter)
  3. After sign: tx.signatures[0] is not all zeros (signature was written)
  4. Signed bytes length === decoded bytes length (slots pre-allocated, signing fills them)
  5. Base64 output does NOT start with a bracket or brace (not JSON)
  6. Base64 output is NOT the same as the base58 input (different encoding)
```

### Quick validation function

```javascript
function validateSignedTx(swapTxBase58, signedBase64) {
  const unsignedBytes = bs58.decode(swapTxBase58);
  const signedBytes = Buffer.from(signedBase64, 'base64');
  console.assert(unsignedBytes.length > 0, 'decoded bytes empty');
  console.assert(signedBytes.length === unsignedBytes.length, 'signed and unsigned should be same length (signature slots pre-allocated)');
  console.assert(signedBase64 !== swapTxBase58, 'output must differ from input (different encoding)');
  console.assert(!/^[{[]/.test(signedBase64), 'base64 should not look like JSON');
  // Deserialize signed to verify it's valid
  const tx = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(signedBytes);
  console.assert(tx.signatures[0].some(b => b !== 0), 'signature should not be zeros');
  console.log('✓ signing pipeline valid');
}
```

## Request / Response Schemas

Machine-readable schemas for pre-validation. The reference client compiles and enforces these required fields with `ajv` before network calls.

### POST /swap — request

```json
{

  "then": { "required": ["amount"], "not": { "required": ["holdings_percentage"] } },
  "else": { "required": ["holdings_percentage"], "not": { "required": ["amount"] } }
}
```

### POST /swap — success response

```json

  "required": ["status", "data"],
  "properties": {
    "status": { "const": "success" },
    "data": {

```

### POST /holdings — response (non-empty)

```json

      "items": {
        "type": "object",

          "decimals": { "type": "integer" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### WebSocket order_filled

When `already_dispatched` is true, the server may omit `data` or `data.swap_tx` (idempotent ack). Schema must not require them.

    "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["success"] },
    "already_dispatched": { "type": "boolean" },
    "entry_mcap": { "type": "number" },
    "triggered_mcap": { "type": "number" },
    "filled_mcap": { "type": ["number", "null"] },
    "target_mcap": { "type": "number" },
    "triggered_at": { "type": "number" },
    "filled_at": { "type": "number" },
    "token_address": { "type": "string" },
    "server_signature": { "type": "string" },
    "data": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {

## Retry / Idempotency Policy

| Error class | Retry? | Max attempts | Backoff | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 400 from /swap | **No** | 0 | — | Bad request. Fix payload. |
| 422 from /swap | **No** | 0 | — | Missing fields. Fix payload. |
| "Error running simulation" | **Cooldown** | 0 immediate | 15m | Mark token unswappable for the session and retry later only if needed. |
| 503 from /protect | **Auto-fallback** | 1 | — | `submitTx()` falls back to RPC internally. No manual action. |
| /protect timeout (30s) | **Check first** | 1 | — | Check tx status via `connection.getSignatureStatuses([sig])`. Only retry if `value[0]` is null (not found). |
| /holdings timeout | **Yes** | 2 | 5s | Endpoint is slow, not broken. |
| /swap 5xx | **Yes** | 2 | 3s | Server issue, may resolve. |
| WS disconnect | **Reconnect** | ∞ | 3s fixed | Re-register. Orders persist. |
| WS error message | **No** | 0 | — | Log and surface to user. |
| On-chain swap failure | **Maybe** | 1 | — | Increase slippage to 2500, retry once. If fails again, skip. |

**Idempotency:** Solana transactions include a recent blockhash. A signed tx can only land once. If /protect times out, the tx may have landed — always check via RPC before re-signing a new tx.

---

## Timeout and Confirmation Contracts

| Endpoint | Timeout | On timeout |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `POST /swap` | 15s | Retry once with 3s backoff |
| `POST /protect` | 30s | Call `connection.getSignatureStatuses([sig])`. If `value[0]` is null → tx didn't land, safe to retry. If `value[0].err` → tx failed on-chain, do not retry. If `confirmationStatus` is `'processed'` → transitional, wait 2s and re-check. If `'confirmed'` or `'finalized'` → landed, do not retry. `submitTx()` handles all this internally. |
| `POST /holdings` | 100s | Retry once with 5s backoff |
| WebSocket connect | 10s | Retry with 3s backoff |

### Post-timeout /protect check

`checkTxLanded()` is defined in the Reference Client above. Returns `{ landed, sig, status }`:
- `{ landed: false, sig, status: 'not_found' }` — safe to retry via RPC fallback
- `{ landed: true, sig, status: 'failed', err }` — tx errored on-chain, do not retry
- `{ landed: true, sig, status: 'processed' }` — transitional, wait 2s and re-check
- `{ landed: true, sig, status: 'confirmed' }` — tx landed, do not retry
- `{ landed: true, sig, status: 'finalized' }` — tx landed and finalized, do not retry

`sig` is the real base58 transaction signature for reconciliation. `submitTx()` handles all of this internally.

 ┌──────────────┐
 │ DISCONNECTED │ ←── ws.close / error / timeout
 └──────┬───────┘
        │ connect
        ▼
 ┌──────────────┐
 │  CHALLENGE   │ ←── server sends {"type":"challenge","nonce":"..."}
 └──────┬───────┘
        │ sign nonce; send register with wallet_address + signature
        ▼
 ┌──────────────┐
 │  REGISTERED  │ ←── server sends {"type":"registered","authenticated":true}
 └──────┬───────┘
        │ (can now send orders)
        ▼
 ┌──────────────┐
 │    ACTIVE    │ ←── orders placed, listening for fills
 └──────────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- **DISCONNECTED:** no sends allowed. Reconnect immediately.
- **CHALLENGE:** sign nonce and send `register` with wallet_address + signature only. All other sends rejected until REGISTERED.
- **REGISTERED / ACTIVE:** all actions allowed. Only enter REGISTERED state when `authenticated: true` is confirmed.
- On any disconnect, state resets to DISCONNECTED. Orders persist server-side.
- Queue any order sends that arrive during DISCONNECTED/CHALLENGE and flush after REGISTERED.

## Execution Safety Guards

All safety enforcement is **built into the reference client** — `enforceSafety()` is called inside `buildSwap()`, `KILL_SWITCH` is checked in `submitTx()` and `ws.send()`, `markUnswappable()` is called on "Error running simulation" responses, token cooldown is checked before WS order placement, and **dailyLoss** is updated on every successful spend path (protect success, timeout recovery, RPC fallback) for both `buy` and `trailing_buy`. **MAX_BUY_LAMPORTS** is enforced in `ws.send()` for `buy` and `trailing_buy` orders so WebSocket orders cannot bypass the per-trade limit.

**Defaults (adjust per deployment):**

`MAX_BUY_LAMPORTS = 0.5 SOL` is intentionally conservative for first deploys. Increase only after risk limits, kill switch, and monitoring are verified.

| Guard | Default | Enforced in |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| MAX_BUY_LAMPORTS | 500,000,000 (0.5 SOL, conservative starter value) | `buildSwap()` via `enforceSafety()`, `ws.send()` for buy/trailing_buy |
| MAX_SLIPPAGE_BPS | 2500 (25%) | `buildSwap()` via `enforceSafety()` |
| MIN_SLIPPAGE_BPS | 100 (1%) | `buildSwap()` via `enforceSafety()` |
| MIN_VALUE_NATIVE | 0 (`valueNative > 0`, defensive) | `getHoldings()` filter |
| UNSWAPPABLE_COOLDOWN_MS | 900,000 (15 minutes) | `markUnswappable()` |
| MAX_DAILY_LOSS_LAMPORTS | 2,000,000,000 (2 SOL) | Updated on every spend path: `/protect` success, timeout_recovery, `_rpcFallback()`; `enforceSafety()` → activates KILL_SWITCH |
| DENYLIST | empty Map (session-scoped cooldown) | `buildSwap()`, `ws.send()`, auto-populated by `markUnswappable()` |
| KILL_SWITCH | false | `submitTx()`, `ws.send()`, auto-activated on daily loss limit |

**Unswappable token cooldown:** When `/swap` returns "Error running simulation", `buildSwap()` calls `markUnswappable(tokenAddress)`, placing that token on a 15-minute session cooldown. This avoids retry loops while allowing future retries later.

**Emergency kill:** Set `KILL_SWITCH = true` to halt all execution. Also auto-activates when `dailyLoss > MAX_DAILY_LOSS_LAMPORTS`.

## Logging Format

All logging is through the `log()` function in the reference client, which outputs JSON lines with automatic timestamp and wallet fields.

**Every step emitted by the reference client:**

| Step | Emitted by | Required fields |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| swap_request | `buildSwap()` | token, action, amount/holdings_percentage, slippage |
| swap_response | `buildSwap()` | token, pool_type, amount_in |
| swap_error | `buildSwap()` | token, error |
| safety_blocked | `enforceSafety()`, `markUnswappable()`, `ws.send()` | token, reason |
| dry_run_skip | `submitTx()`, `ws.send()` | token, action, message |
| protect_success | `submitTx()` | token, signature |
| protect_503 | `submitTx()` | message |
| protect_timeout | `submitTx()` | token, message |
| protect_timeout_landed | `submitTx()` | signature, status |
| protect_timeout_processed | `submitTx()` | signature, message |
| protect_timeout_failed | `submitTx()` | signature, message |
| protect_timeout_not_landed | `submitTx()` | message |
| rpc_fallback_success | `_rpcFallback()` | signature |
| sell_skipped | `main()` | message |
| ws_connected | WS `open` handler | — |
| ws_registered | WS `registered` handler | — |
| ws_disconnected | WS `close` handler | message |
| ws_error | WS `error` handler | error |
| ws_queued | `ws.send()` | action, message |
| order_placed | WS `order_created` handler | order_id, token, action, target_mcap |
| order_filled | `handleOrderFilled()` | order_id, order_type, token, triggered_mcap, filled_mcap |
| order_fill_error | `handleOrderFilled()` | order_id, error |
| order_fill_skipped | `handleOrderFilled()` | order_id, reason, triggered_mcap, filled_mcap |
| order_fill_submitted | `handleOrderFilled()` | order_id, signature |
| order_fill_verify_failed | `verifyOrderFilledSignature()` | order_id, reason |

## Dry-Run / Paper Mode

**Safe-by-default:** `DRY_RUN` is **true** unless you explicitly set `DRY_RUN=false`. A fresh agent runs paper mode automatically — no accidental live trades on first run.

Dry-run is enforced at the two chokepoints in the reference client — `submitTx()` and `ws.send()`. The agent runs the full pipeline (fetches swap quotes, enforces safety guards, logs everything) but:

- **`submitTx()`** short-circuits before submission and returns `{ signature: null, dry_run: true }`
- **`ws.send()`** blocks all mutating actions (`sell`, `buy`, `trailing_sell`, `trailing_buy`, `cancel_order`, `extend_order`) and logs intent
- Only read-only operations pass through: `register`, `list_orders`, `check_order`

There is no separate "paper mode function." The same `main()` code path runs in both modes — `DRY_RUN` just gates the irreversible actions.

```bash
# Paper mode (default — no DRY_RUN env needed)
PRIVATE_KEY=... node agent.js

# Live mode — must explicitly opt in
DRY_RUN=false PRIVATE_KEY=... node agent.js
```

## Preflight Startup Checklist

The `preflight()` function is built into the reference client. It runs automatically at the start of `main()` and exits the process if any check fails.

**Checks performed:**

| Check | Fails if |
|-------|----------|
| PRIVATE_KEY loaded | env var missing |
| RPC_URL configured | always passes (warns if using default public RPC) |
| Wallet loads | key is invalid/undecodable |
| RPC reachable | `getSlot()` fails |
| SOL balance > 0.01 | balance < 10,000,000 lamports |
| /holdings responds | endpoint unreachable or times out |
| WS register | WebSocket connect, challenge–response, or `authenticated: true` confirmation fails within 10s |

After all checks, preflight reports mode (`DRY RUN` or `LIVE TRADING`).
