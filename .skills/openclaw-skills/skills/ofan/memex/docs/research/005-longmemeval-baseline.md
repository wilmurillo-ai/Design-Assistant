# LongMemEval Baseline — 2026-03-18

## Setup

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| Benchmark | LongMemEval_s (ICLR 2025), N=50 |
| Embedding model | Qwen3-Embedding-4B-Q8_0 (2560d) |
| Embedding server | llama-swap on local GPU server |
| Fusion | Z-score (0.8 vec + 0.2 BM25) |
| Chunking | 2000 chars, 200 overlap, max-sim across chunks |
| Reader LLM | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| Reranker | None (disabled for this run) |
| Database | SQLite + sqlite-vec + FTS5 |
| Vector pool | 30 candidates |
| BM25 pool | 20 candidates |

## Results

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| **R@1** | **39/50 (78%)** |
| **R@3** | **45/50 (90%)** |
| **R@5** | **48/50 (96%)** |
| **E2E (GPT-4o)** | **45/50 (90%)** |

Evaluated with official LongMemEval reader prompt and GPT-4o-mini LLM-judge.

Note: earlier runs with a custom reader prompt ("say NOT FOUND if not in history") scored 68% E2E with GPT-4o due to the model refusing to answer. The official prompt ("answer based on the relevant chat history") does not trigger this behavior.

## Progression

| Change | R@1 | R@3 | E2E |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (raw 0.7v+0.3b, truncated embed) | 22% | — | 64% |
| + Z-score fusion (0.8v+0.2b) | 44% | 62% | 76% |
| + Improved scorer (aliases, parens) | 44% | 62% | 76% |
| + Chunked embedding (max-sim) | **78%** | **90%** | **88%** |

## What Each Change Did

**Z-score fusion (+22pp R@1):** Normalizes vec and BM25 score distributions to zero-mean/unit-variance before combining. Absent signals get z=0 (neutral) instead of penalizing. Formula: `fusedScore = sigmoid(0.8 * vz + 0.2 * bz)`.

**Chunked embedding (+34pp R@1):** Sessions are 10K-19K chars but were truncated to 2000 chars for embedding. Answer facts buried beyond the window were invisible. Fix: split into overlapping 2000-char chunks, embed each independently, use `max(cosine(query, chunk_i))` as session score. 16,691 chunks from 2,258 sessions.

**Improved scorer (+4pp E2E):** Alias table (Valentine's Day ↔ Feb 14th), parenthetical extraction (UCLA), bidirectional substring matching.

## Remaining Misses

### 5 R@3 Misses
| ID | Question | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| e47becba | What degree did I graduate with? | Business Administration |
| 5d3d2817 | What was my previous occupation? | Marketing specialist |
| bc8a6e93 | What did I bake for my niece's birthday? | Lemon blueberry cake |
| ccb36322 | Music streaming service? | Spotify |
| b320f3f8 | Action figure from thrift store? | Blue Snaggletooth |

3 of 5 still get correct E2E answers from alternative sessions.

### 6 E2E Failures
- 4 R@1/FAIL: correct retrieval but LLM gives wrong answer
- 2 miss/FAIL: genuinely hard retrieval + no answer in alternatives

## Comparison to Published Systems

| System | E2E Accuracy | Reader LLM |
|---|---|---|
| Hindsight/TEMPR | 91.4% | GPT-4o |
| **memex** | **88.0%** | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| Zep/Graphiti | ~85% | GPT-4o |
| mem0 (graph) | ~78% | GPT-4o |
| MemGPT/Letta | ~75% | GPT-4o |

## Reproduction

```bash
# Fast tier (pure math on cached scores, ~1s)
TIER=fast node --import jiti/register tests/fast-benchmark.ts

# E2E tier (fast + Gemini reader, ~2min)
TIER=e2e GEMINI_API_KEY=... node --import jiti/register tests/fast-benchmark.ts

# Rebuild chunk scores from scratch (~5 hours)
LLAMA_SWAP_API_KEY=... BATCH_SIZE=16 PARALLEL=1 node --import jiti/register tests/build-chunk-cache.ts
