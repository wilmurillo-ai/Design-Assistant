## Scoring System

All scored outputs use this grading scale:

| Score Range | Grade | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 85-100 | A | Excellent -- minor optimizations only |
| 70-84 | B | Good -- clear opportunities for improvement |
| 55-69 | C | Average -- significant gaps to address |
| 40-54 | D | Below average -- major overhaul needed |
| 0-39 | F | Critical -- fundamental marketing issues |

---

## Output Standards

All outputs must follow these rules:
1. **Actionable over theoretical** -- Every recommendation must be specific enough to implement
2. **Prioritized** -- Always rank by impact (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Revenue-focused** -- Connect every suggestion to business outcomes
4. **Example-driven** -- Include before/after copy examples, not just advice
5. **Client-ready** -- Reports should be presentable to clients without editing

---

## Cross-Skill Integration

Commands build on each other:
- `audit` produces comprehensive analysis that informs all other commands
- `proposal` references audit results if available for data-backed proposals
- `copy` benefits from `brand` voice guidelines if run first
- `emails` uses insights from `funnel` analysis if available
- `ads` uses `competitors` intelligence for competitive ad angles
- `social` aligns with `emails` for multi-channel consistency
- `landing` incorporates `audit` findings for deeper CRO analysis
