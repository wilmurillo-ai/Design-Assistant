Use when the user wants to review a PR, code review, check a pull request, or mentions 'review my PR', 'code review', 'check this PR'. Also triggers when dev-workflow reaches the code review phase."

# Code Review — Multi-Agent PR Review

Provide a thorough, multi-perspective code review for pull requests using parallel agents with confidence-based filtering.

The goal is to find real, impactful bugs while avoiding false positives and nitpicks. A senior engineer wouldn't waste time on trivial issues — neither should this review.

## Process

Follow these steps precisely:

### 1. Eligibility Check (Haiku agent)

Check if the pull request: (a) is closed, (b) is a draft, (c) does not need review (automated PR, trivially simple), or (d) already has a code review from you. If any condition is true, stop.

### 2. Discover CLAUDE.md Files (Haiku agent)

Get file paths (not contents) of relevant CLAUDE.md files: the root CLAUDE.md and any CLAUDE.md files in directories whose files the PR modified.

### 3. Summarize the Change (Haiku agent)

View the pull request and return a summary of the change.

### 4. Parallel Review (5 Sonnet agents)

Launch 5 parallel agents. Each returns a list of issues with the reason each was flagged:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **#1 — CLAUDE.md Compliance** | Audit changes against CLAUDE.md rules. Note: CLAUDE.md is guidance for code writing, so not all instructions apply during review. |
| **#2 — Bug Scan** | Shallow scan for obvious bugs in the diff only. Focus on large bugs. Avoid nitpicks. Ignore likely false positives. |
| **#3 — Git History** | Read git blame and history of modified code. Identify bugs in light of historical context. |
| **#4 — Previous PRs** | Read previous PRs that touched these files. Check for comments that may apply to the current PR. |
| **#5 — Code Comments** | Read code comments in modified files. Ensure changes comply with guidance in those comments. |

### 5. Confidence Scoring (parallel Haiku agents)

For each issue found, launch a Haiku agent that scores confidence 0-100:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **0** | False positive. Doesn't hold up to scrutiny, or pre-existing issue. |
| **25** | Might be real, might be false positive. Unable to verify. Stylistic issues not in CLAUDE.md. |
| **50** | Verified real issue, but may be a nitpick or rare in practice. Not very important relative to the PR. |
| **75** | Double-checked and very likely real. Will be hit in practice. Existing approach is insufficient. Directly mentioned in CLAUDE.md. |
| **100** | Absolutely certain. Confirmed real, happens frequently. Evidence directly confirms. |

For CLAUDE.md issues, the agent must double-check that the CLAUDE.md actually calls out that issue specifically.

### 6. Filter

Discard issues scoring below **80**. If no issues remain, proceed to step 8 with "no issues found."

### 7. Re-check Eligibility (Haiku agent)

Repeat the eligibility check from step 1 to make sure the PR is still eligible.

### 8. Post Comment

Use `gh pr comment` to post the review. Keep it brief, no emojis, cite and link relevant code/files/URLs.

**Format (with issues):**

```markdown
### Code review

Found N issues:

1. <brief description> (CLAUDE.md says "<...>")

<link to file and line with full SHA + line range>

2. <brief description> (bug due to <file and code snippet>)

<link to file and line with full SHA + line range>
```

**Format (no issues):**

```markdown
### Code review

No issues found. Checked for bugs and CLAUDE.md compliance.
```

**Link format:** `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/<full-sha>/path/to/file.ts#L10-L15`
- Must use full git SHA (not HEAD or short hash)
- Include 1 line of context before and after the issue
- Line range: `L[start]-L[end]`

## False Positives to Ignore

These are NOT real issues:
- Pre-existing issues (not introduced by this PR)
- Something that looks like a bug but isn't
- Pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't mention
- Issues a linter, typechecker, or compiler would catch (imports, types, formatting)
- General code quality issues (coverage, docs) unless required by CLAUDE.md
- CLAUDE.md violations explicitly silenced in code (lint ignore comments)
- Intentional functionality changes related to the broader change
- Real issues on lines the user did not modify

## Notes

- Do NOT check build signal, build, or typecheck. Those run separately in CI.
- Use `gh` for all GitHub interactions (not web fetch)
- Make a todo list first to track progress
- Cite and link every bug (if from CLAUDE.md, link the specific file)
- Consult `references/review-patterns.md` for advanced review patterns including blast-radius analysis, structured output templates, and test coverage gap detection.
