# AIsa Youtube Serp Scout

Search YouTube videos, channels, rankings, and trends through AIsa. Use when: the user needs YouTube research, competitor scouting, or content discovery. Supports video discovery and SERP-style analysis.

## When to use

- The user needs YouTube video, channel, or trend discovery.
- The user wants content research, SERP scouting, or competitor review.
- The user wants public YouTube results quickly.

## High-Intent Workflows

- Find top-ranking videos for a topic.
- Inspect a competitor channel's recent content direction.
- Scan trend-heavy queries for content opportunities.

## Quick Reference

- `python3 scripts/youtube_client.py --help`

## Setup

- `AISA_API_KEY` is required for AIsa-backed API access.
- Use repo-relative `scripts/` paths from the shipped package.
- Prefer explicit CLI auth flags when a script exposes them.

## Example Requests

- Search top YouTube videos about OpenAI Agents
- Review a competitor channel's recent uploads

## Guardrails

- Do not invent video titles, URLs, or metrics.
- Summaries should stay grounded in returned results.
- If the upstream returns no results, say so clearly.
