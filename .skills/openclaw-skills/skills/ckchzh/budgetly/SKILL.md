# BudgetLy

BudgetLy v2.0.0 — a personal finance toolkit for recording expenses, categorizing spending, checking balances, analyzing trends, forecasting budgets, and generating reports from the command line.

## Why BudgetLy?

- Full-featured personal finance tracker with 12 specialized commands
- No external dependencies, accounts, or API keys needed — your data stays local
- All entries are timestamped and stored in plain-text log files
- Export to JSON, CSV, or TXT for analysis in spreadsheets or other tools
- Built-in search, statistics, and health-check utilities
- Works on any system with Bash

All entry commands (record, categorize, balance, trend, forecast, export-report, budget-check, summary, alert, history, compare, tax-note) work the same way:
- **With arguments**: saves a timestamped entry to `<command>.log` and logs to `history.log`
- **Without arguments**: displays the 20 most recent entries from that command's log

## Data Storage

All data is stored in `~/.local/share/budgetly/`:

- `record.log`, `categorize.log`, `balance.log`, etc. — one log file per command
- `history.log` — unified activity log across all commands
- `export.json` / `export.csv` / `export.txt` — generated export files

Each entry is stored as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|<value>` (pipe-delimited timestamp and content).

## Requirements

- Bash (with `set -euo pipefail`)
- Standard Unix utilities: `date`, `wc`, `du`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `cat`
- No external dependencies, no Python, no API keys

## When to Use

1. **Daily expense logging** — Use `budgetly record "Lunch at cafe ¥45"` to maintain a running log of daily expenses and review them later with `budgetly record` (no args shows recent entries).
2. **Category-based spending analysis** — Use `budgetly categorize "food: ¥2,300 this month"` to organize expenses by category and then search with `budgetly search "food"` to analyze patterns.
3. **Monthly budget forecasting** — Use `budgetly forecast "April budget: rent ¥3000, food ¥2500, transport ¥800"` to plan ahead and compare actuals later with `budgetly compare`.
4. **Tax preparation** — Use `budgetly tax-note "Home office deduction: ¥1,200/month, receipts in folder Q1-2026"` to keep tax-related notes organized and export them with `budgetly export csv`.
5. **Spending alerts and limits** — Use `budgetly alert "Entertainment budget exceeded: ¥1,500/¥1,000 limit"` to log overspend warnings and review alerts with `budgetly alert`.

## Examples

# Record daily expenses
budgetly record "Coffee ¥15, lunch ¥42, groceries ¥128"
