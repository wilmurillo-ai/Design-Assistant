# Taobao and Tmall

This skill wraps 9 Taobao and Tmall operations exposed by JustOneAPI. It is strongest for product Details, product Reviews, shop Product List, and product Search. Expect common inputs such as `itemId`, `page`, `sort`, `userId`, `shopId`.

## When To Use It

- The user needs product Details or product Reviews on Taobao and Tmall.
- The task lines up with shop Product List rather than a generic cross-platform workflow.
- The user can provide identifiers or filters such as `itemId`, `page`, `sort`, `userId`.
- The user wants an exact API-backed answer instead of a freeform summary.

## Representative Operations

- `getItemDetailV1`: Product Details — Get Taobao and Tmall product Details data, including pricing, images, and shop details, for product research, catalog monitoring, and ecommerce analysis
- `getItemCommentV3`: Product Reviews — Get Taobao and Tmall product Reviews data, including ratings, timestamps, and reviewer signals, for feedback analysis and product research
- `getShopItemListV1`: Shop Product List — Get Taobao and Tmall shop Product List data, including item titles, prices, and images, for seller research and catalog tracking
- `searchItemListV1`: Product Search — Get Taobao and Tmall product Search data, including titles, prices, and images, for product discovery

## Request Pattern

- 9 operations are available in this skill.
- HTTP methods used here: `GET`.
- The most common non-token parameters are `itemId`, `page`, `sort`, `userId`, `shopId`.
- All operations in this skill are parameter-driven requests; none require a request body.

## How To Work

1. Read `generated/operations.md` before choosing an endpoint.
2. Start with one of these operations when it matches the user's request: `getItemDetailV1`, `getItemCommentV3`, `getShopItemListV1`, `searchItemListV1`.
3. Pick the smallest matching operation instead of guessing.
4. Ask the user for any missing required parameter. Do not invent values.
5. Call the helper with:

```bash
node {baseDir}/bin/run.mjs --operation "<operation-id>" --token "$JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN" --params-json '{"key":"value"}'
```

## Environment

- Required: `JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN`
- This skill uses `JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN` only for authenticated Just One API requests.
- Keep `JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN` private. Do not paste it into chat messages, screenshots, or logs.
- Get a token from [Just One API Dashboard](https://dashboard.justoneapi.com/en/login?utm_source=clawhub.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=justoneapi_taobao&utm_content=project_link).
- Authentication details: [Just One API Usage Guide](https://docs.justoneapi.com/en/?utm_source=clawhub.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=justoneapi_taobao&utm_content=project_link).

## Output Rules

- Start with a plain-language answer tied to the Taobao and Tmall task the user asked for.
- Include the most decision-relevant fields from the selected endpoint before dumping raw JSON.
- When using `getItemDetailV1`, explain why the returned fields answer the user's question.
- If the user gave filters such as `itemId`, `page`, `sort`, echo those back so the scope is explicit.
- If the backend errors, include the backend payload and the exact operation ID.
