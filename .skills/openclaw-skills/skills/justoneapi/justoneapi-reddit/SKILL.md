# Reddit

This skill wraps 3 Reddit operations exposed by JustOneAPI. It is strongest for post Details, post Comments, and keyword Search. Expect common inputs such as `postId`, `after`, `cursor`, `keyword`.

## When To Use It

- The user needs post Details or post Comments on Reddit.
- The task lines up with keyword Search rather than a generic cross-platform workflow.
- The user can provide identifiers or filters such as `postId`, `after`, `cursor`, `keyword`.
- The user wants an exact API-backed answer instead of a freeform summary.

## Representative Operations

- `getPostDetailV1`: Post Details — Get Reddit post Details data, including author details, subreddit info, and engagement counts, for content analysis, moderation research, and monitoring
- `getPostCommentsV1`: Post Comments — Get Reddit post Comments data, including text, authors, and timestamps, for discussion analysis and moderation research
- `searchV1`: Keyword Search — Get Reddit keyword Search data, including titles, authors, and subreddit context, for topic discovery and monitoring

## Request Pattern

- 3 operations are available in this skill.
- HTTP methods used here: `GET`.
- The most common non-token parameters are `postId`, `after`, `cursor`, `keyword`.
- All operations in this skill are parameter-driven requests; none require a request body.

## How To Work

1. Read `generated/operations.md` before choosing an endpoint.
2. Start with one of these operations when it matches the user's request: `getPostDetailV1`, `getPostCommentsV1`, `searchV1`.
3. Pick the smallest matching operation instead of guessing.
4. Ask the user for any missing required parameter. Do not invent values.
5. Call the helper with:

```bash
node {baseDir}/bin/run.mjs --operation "<operation-id>" --token "$JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN" --params-json '{"key":"value"}'
```

## Environment

- Required: `JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN`
- This skill uses `JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN` only for authenticated Just One API requests.
- Keep `JUST_ONE_API_TOKEN` private. Do not paste it into chat messages, screenshots, or logs.
- Get a token from [Just One API Dashboard](https://dashboard.justoneapi.com/en/login?utm_source=clawhub.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=justoneapi_reddit&utm_content=project_link).
- Authentication details: [Just One API Usage Guide](https://docs.justoneapi.com/en/?utm_source=clawhub.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=justoneapi_reddit&utm_content=project_link).

## Output Rules

- Start with a plain-language answer tied to the Reddit task the user asked for.
- Include the most decision-relevant fields from the selected endpoint before dumping raw JSON.
- When using `getPostDetailV1`, explain why the returned fields answer the user's question.
- If the user gave filters such as `postId`, `after`, `cursor`, echo those back so the scope is explicit.
- If the backend errors, include the backend payload and the exact operation ID.
