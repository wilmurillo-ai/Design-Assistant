# Changelog

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-16

- Security: cache only grant credentials on disk and reuse approved grants without reissuing tokens locally
- Fix: distinguish expired grants from revoked or deleted grants so agents can re-authorize in place
- Docs: align raw API examples with `approval_url` and tighten OpenClaw publish guidance
- Packaging: validate the exact staged ClawHub package before publishing and scan the staged artifact in CI

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-27

- Security: stop caching bearer tokens on disk; cache only grant credentials
- Fix: recreate dead grants automatically in URL mode and fail fast in `--token`
