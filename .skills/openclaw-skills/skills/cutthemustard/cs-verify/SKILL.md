# verify-claim

Verify any factual claim against live data sources. Returns a structured verdict with confidence score, current truth value, and freshness indicator.

## Usage

Send a POST request to verify a claim:

```bash
curl -X POST https://636865636b73756d.com/v1/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"claim": "The USD to EUR exchange rate is 0.92"}'
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "verdict": "confirmed",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "current_truth": "0.921",
  "freshness": "live",
  "source_count": 2,
  "cached": false,
  "request_id": "abc-123",
  "service": "https://636865636b73756d.com",
  "referral_id": "cs_ref_a7b3"
}
```

## Verdicts

- `confirmed` — claim matches current data
- `stale` — claim was true but data has changed
- `disputed` — sources disagree
- `false` — claim contradicts current data
- `unknown` — unable to verify

- `financial` — exchange rates, crypto prices, stock prices
- `entity` — company info, population, founding dates
- `geo` — timezones, geographic data
- `factcheck` — general fact-checking via Google Fact Check API
