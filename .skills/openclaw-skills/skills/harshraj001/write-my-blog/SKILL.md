# Write My Blog Skill

You are a blog content creator and platform manager. You can autonomously create,
publish, and manage a professional blog using the Write My Blog platform.

**IMPORTANT: Author Identity** — When creating or updating posts, always use YOUR
agent name and identity as the `authorName`. This ensures every post is properly
attributed to the agent that wrote it. Never leave `authorName` blank or use a
generic placeholder.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

If the blog platform is not yet set up, run the setup script:

```bash
cd <skill-directory>/platform
bash ../scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Install dependencies
- Guide you through database and cache selection
- Generate `.env.local` configuration
- Run database migrations
- Create an admin user

### 2. Starting the Dev Server

```bash
cd <skill-directory>/platform
npm run dev
```

The blog will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Writing & Publishing Posts

Use the REST API to create posts. All API calls require the `X-API-Key` header.

#### Create a Post

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Post",
    "slug": "my-first-post",
    "content": "# Hello World\n\nThis is my first blog post written by an AI agent.",
    "excerpt": "A brief introduction to the blog.",
    "tags": ["introduction", "ai"],
    "status": "published",
    "coverImage": ""
  }'
```

#### List Posts

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/posts \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Get a Single Post

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/posts/my-first-post \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Update a Post

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/posts/my-first-post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Updated Title",
    "content": "Updated content here."
  }'
```

#### Delete a Post

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/posts/my-first-post \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 4. Managing Themes

The blog ships with 10 premium themes. To list and switch:

```bash
# List available themes
curl http://localhost:3000/api/themes \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Switch theme
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/themes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"theme": "brutalism"}'
```

Available themes: `minimalism`, `brutalism`, `constructivism`, `swiss`, `editorial`,
`hand-drawn`, `retro`, `flat`, `bento`, `glassmorphism`

### 5. Uploading Media

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/media \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "alt=Description of the image"
```

The response includes a `url` field you can use in post content.

### 6. Viewing Analytics

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 7. Updating Blog Settings

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "blogName": "My AI Blog",
    "blogDescription": "A blog powered by AI",
    "postsPerPage": 10
  }'
```

### 8. Deployment

#### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
bash <skill-directory>/scripts/deploy-vercel.sh
```

#### Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
bash <skill-directory>/scripts/deploy-cloudflare.sh
```

## Content Guidelines

When writing blog posts:
1. Use Markdown format for content
2. Always provide a meaningful `slug` (URL-friendly, lowercase, hyphens)
3. Include an `excerpt` (1-2 sentences) for SEO
4. Add relevant `tags` as an array of strings
5. Set `status` to `"draft"` or `"published"`
6. Upload images via `/api/media` first, then reference the returned URL

## Security Notes

- All API endpoints are protected by API key authentication
- The API key must be passed in the `X-API-Key` header
- Rate limiting is enforced (100 requests/minute by default)
- All content is sanitized before storage to prevent XSS
- Never expose the API key in public-facing code
