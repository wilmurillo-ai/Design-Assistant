# Codex Machine Payment Protocol (MPP)

Use this skill when the Codex Supergraph returns a `402 Payment Required` response. The MPP challenge flow lets you pay per query without needing an API key.

|                       |                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP endpoint         | `https://graph.codex.io/graphql`                                |
| Credential header     | `Authorization: Payment <base64url-credential>`                 |

## How it works

1. Send a GraphQL query (no credential).
2. Server returns `402 Payment Required` with `WWW-Authenticate: Payment ...` challenges.
3. Client solves one challenge and retries with `Authorization: Payment <credential>`.
4. Server returns GraphQL data + `Payment-Receipt` header.

## Constraints

- **Query only.** Mutations and subscriptions return `403` in MPP mode.
- If a valid API key or bearer token is also present, API auth takes precedence.

## Rules

- Never print raw credentials.
- Only use MPP for `query` operations.
- **Before constructing any query**, read `references/query-templates.md` below for the correct GraphQL schema. Do not guess query or field names.
