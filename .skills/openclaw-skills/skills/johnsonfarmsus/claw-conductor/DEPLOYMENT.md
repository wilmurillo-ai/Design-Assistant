## 🚀 How to Use

### From Discord

User posts in OpenClaw Discord:
```
@OpenClaw use claw-conductor to build a todo app with React and SQLite
```

Claw Conductor will:
1. ✨ Decompose into tasks (frontend, backend, database, tests)
2. 🎯 Route each task to optimal model
3. 📁 Create project at `/root/projects/todo-app/`
4. ⚡ Execute 5 tasks in parallel
5. 📦 Consolidate results, run tests, commit to git
6. 🐙 Push to GitHub repository

### Example Workflow

**Simple Request:**
```
@OpenClaw use claw-conductor to build a calculator
```

Result: 3 tasks, ~8 minutes, pushed to GitHub

**Complex Request:**
```
@OpenClaw use claw-conductor to build a dispatch system with
customer portal, driver dashboard, and admin panel
```

Result: 8 tasks, ~45 minutes, full application on GitHub
