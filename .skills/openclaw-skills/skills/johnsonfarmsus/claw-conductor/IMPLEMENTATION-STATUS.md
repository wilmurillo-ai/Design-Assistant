# Claw-Conductor v2.1 - Implementation Status

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** ✅ Core features implemented, ready for testing

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Configuration System
**File:** `config/conductor-config.json`

- ✅ Triage configuration (model, bias, thresholds)
- ✅ Discord integration settings
- ✅ Simple response configuration
- ✅ Development mode settings
- ✅ Logging configuration
- ✅ User override triggers (!simple, !dev)

### 2. Discord Integration
**File:** `scripts/discord_integration.py`

- ✅ Channel → workspace auto-detection
- ✅ Channel mapping persistence (`channel-workspace-map.json`)
- ✅ Auto-sync from `/root/projects/` directory
- ✅ Context detection (Discord vs direct invocation)
- ✅ Fallback to direct parameters when not in Discord
- ✅ Project listing and management

**Key Functions:**
- `detect_context()` - Detects if message is from Discord and maps to workspace
- `sync_from_projects()` - Auto-discovers projects in /root/projects
- `get_all_projects()` - Lists all mapped projects

### 3. Request Triage
**File:** `scripts/orchestrator.py` (updated)

- ✅ Intelligent classification (simple vs development)
- ✅ Keyword-based heuristics with configurable bias
- ✅ User override support (!simple, !dev)
- ✅ Path announcement (📋 Simple / 🔧 Development)
- ✅ Placeholder for AI-powered triage (marked TODO)

**Triage Logic:**
- Development keywords: build, create, implement, add, fix, refactor, etc.
- Simple keywords: what, why, how, explain, show, list, status, etc.
- Bias: Slightly favors development when uncertain
- Overrides: User can force mode with !simple or !dev

### 4. Simple Response Handler
**File:** `scripts/orchestrator.py` (updated)

- ✅ Fast response mode for questions/chat
- ✅ Project-aware context (knows workspace, files, etc.)
- ✅ Configurable model selection
- ✅ Placeholder for actual model API call (marked TODO)

### 5. Main Entry Point
**File:** `scripts/orchestrator.py` - `handle_message()`

New unified entry point that:
- ✅ Detects Discord context
- ✅ Maps channel to workspace
- ✅ Triages request
- ✅ Announces path
- ✅ Routes to simple or development handler

### 6. Channel Mapping
**File:** `config/channel-workspace-map.json`

Pre-configured mappings for your existing projects:
- ✅ dispatch-suite
- ✅ scientific-calculator
- ✅ openclaw-commands
- ✅ satire-news

### 7. Updated Documentation
**File:** `SKILL.md` (updated)

- ✅ Always-on mode explanation
- ✅ Usage examples (simple vs development)
- ✅ User override documentation
- ✅ Integration instructions

## 🔄 TODO (Integration Points)

### 1. Model API Integration
**Location:** `orchestrator.py` - Line ~95 (triage) and ~165 (simple response)

Currently using placeholder logic. Need to:
```python
# In triage_request():
# TODO: Actually call the model
response = call_model(triage_model, prompt)
classification = parse_response(response)

# In handle_simple_response():
# TODO: Actually call the model
response = call_model(model, prompt)
```

**Options:**
- Call OpenClaw API directly
- Use model provider APIs directly
- Shell out to `openclaw chat` command

### 2. OpenClaw Hook Integration
**Location:** OpenClaw agent configuration

Need to configure OpenClaw to route "Active Projects" messages through claw-conductor:

**Option A - Agent-level hook:**
```python
# In OpenClaw agent config for "Active Projects" channels
default_handler = "claw-conductor"
```

**Option B - Pre-message hook:**
```bash
# In OpenClaw hooks
if channel_category == "Active Projects":
    python ~/.openclaw/skills/claw-conductor/scripts/orchestrator.py
```

**Option C - Modify agent routing:**
Make each Active Projects agent call claw-conductor by default

### 3. Environment Variable Passing
**Location:** Discord → OpenClaw → Claw-conductor

Need to ensure Discord channel info reaches conductor:
```bash
export DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID="1234567890"
export DISCORD_CHANNEL_NAME="scientific-calculator"
```

Or pass as parameters when invoking.

### 4. Testing on VPS
**Location:** `/root/.openclaw/skills/claw-conductor/`

Once local testing complete:
1. Copy updated files to VPS
2. Test triage classification
3. Test Discord detection
4. Test workspace mapping
5. Test simple responses
6. Test development orchestration

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [ ] Test discord_integration.py standalone
- [ ] Test triage classification with various inputs
- [ ] Test user overrides (!simple, !dev)
- [ ] Test context detection (Discord vs direct)
- [ ] Test channel mapping file loading
- [ ] Test orchestrator.main() examples

### VPS Testing
- [ ] Copy files to VPS claw-conductor
- [ ] Test from Discord channel in "Active Projects"
- [ ] Verify channel → workspace mapping
- [ ] Test simple question flow
- [ ] Test development request flow
- [ ] Test user overrides in Discord
- [ ] Verify path announcements appear

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with actual model API calls
- [ ] Test parallel execution still works
- [ ] Test consolidation still works
- [ ] Test GitHub integration still works
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent projects

## 📋 Configuration Reference

### Triage Settings (`conductor-config.json`)
```json
"triage": {
  "enabled": true,                           // Enable/disable triage
  "model": "chutes/openai/gpt-oss-120b-TEE", // Fast model for classification
  "bias": "development",                      // Lean towards dev when uncertain
  "announce_path": true,                      // Show 📋 / 🔧 indicators
  "user_overrides": {
    "simple_trigger": "!simple",              // Force simple mode
    "dev_trigger": "!dev"                     // Force development mode
  }
}
```

### Discord Settings
```json
"discord": {
  "enabled": true,                            // Enable Discord integration
  "auto_detect": true,                        // Auto-detect channel context
  "projects_dir": "/root/projects",           // Where projects live
  "active_category": "Active Projects"        // Category to monitor

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - Run the examples in `orchestrator.py`
2. **Add model API calls** - Replace TODO placeholders with actual calls
3. **Deploy to VPS** - Copy to `/root/.openclaw/skills/claw-conductor/`
4. **Configure OpenClaw** - Set up routing to claw-conductor
5. **Test in Discord** - Verify end-to-end flow
6. **Iterate** - Refine triage logic based on real usage
