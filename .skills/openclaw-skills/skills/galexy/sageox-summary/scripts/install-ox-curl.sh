#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-ox-curl.sh — download a pinned ox release binary directly from
# GitHub Releases, verify it against an embedded sha256 checksum, and
# install to $HOME/.local/bin. No sudo, no shell-script piping, no
# dynamic "latest" resolution.
#
# Why this shape: scanners flag `curl | bash` of a remote shell script,
# and skills that sudo into system paths. This script avoids both. The
# release tag and per-platform sha256s are pinned in the source below, so
# an attacker cannot substitute a different binary without also editing
# this file (which is reviewed on skill publish).
#
# Bumping: when a newer sageox/ox release ships, update OX_INSTALL_REF
# and the OX_SHA256_* constants. Fetch checksums.txt from
# https://github.com/sageox/ox/releases/download/<tag>/checksums.txt
#
# Usage: install-ox-curl.sh
#
# Stdout: human-readable progress
# Stderr: errors
# Exit:
#   0 — success, ox installed and memory file written
#   3 — internal error (curl/tar missing, download failed, checksum
#       mismatch, unsupported platform, or ox not runnable after install)
