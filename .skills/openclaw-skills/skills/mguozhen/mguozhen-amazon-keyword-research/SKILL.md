## What Data to Provide

- **Seed keyword** — your main product keyword (e.g., "yoga mat")
- **Product description** — helps discover related terms
- **Competitor ASINs** — reverse-engineer their keyword strategy
- **Target market** — US, UK, DE, etc.
- **Budget/focus** — broad discovery vs. focused exact-match targeting

## Keyword Research Framework

### Phase 1: Seed Expansion
- Head terms → broad variations → long-tail
- Synonym discovery (material, use case, audience, benefit)
- Negative intent filtering (irrelevant, competitor brand)

### Phase 2: Classification
| Type | Example | Best Use |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Head term** | yoga mat | Title, high competition |
| **Long-tail** | non-slip yoga mat 6mm thick | Bullet points, backend |
| **Use-case** | yoga mat for hot yoga | Backend, A+ content |
| **Audience** | yoga mat for beginners | PPC exact match |
| **Attribute** | extra thick yoga mat purple | Long-tail PPC |
| **Problem** | yoga mat without smell | FAQ, backend |

### Phase 3: Priority Scoring
Score each keyword 1–10 based on:
- Search volume (estimated from category context)
- Relevance to product (1–5 scale)
- Competition level (# of sponsored results)
- Conversion intent (informational vs. transactional)

**Priority formula**: (Volume × Relevance × Intent) / Competition

### Phase 4: Placement Strategy
| Location | Keyword Type | Character Limit |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Title | Top 3–5 keywords | 200 bytes |
| Bullet 1 | Feature keywords | 500 bytes each |
| Search Terms (backend) | Long-tail, synonyms | 250 bytes |
| A+ Content | Audience/use-case | No limit |
| PPC Broad | Discovery terms | — |
| PPC Exact | Proven converters | — |

## Output Format

1. **Keyword Universe** — 30–50 keywords organized by cluster
2. **Priority Matrix** — top 10 keywords to focus on first
3. **Placement Map** — where each keyword goes (title/bullets/backend/PPC)
4. **Negative List** — irrelevant terms to exclude from PPC
5. **Content Gaps** — search intents your listing currently misses

## Rules

1. Never recommend stuffing keywords unnaturally into listing copy
2. Flag brand name keywords (trademark risk)
3. Prioritize buyer-intent keywords over informational
4. Always separate PPC keywords from organic/listing keywords
5. Recommend testing 2–3 title variations for new products
