## What Data to Provide

- **Your COGS** (landed cost per unit)
- **Current price & sales velocity**
- **Competitor prices** — paste from search results
- **Buy Box win rate** — from Seller Central
- **Target margin %** — your profit floor
- **Product stage** — launch / growth / mature / declining

## Pricing Strategy by Stage

### Stage 1: Launch Pricing (First 30–60 days)
**Goal**: Velocity over margin — get reviews and ranking fast

| Approach | Price Point | When to Use |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Aggressive launch | 10–20% below market average | New product, competitive category |
| Parity launch | Match #1 competitor | Differentiated product, strong listing |
| Premium launch | 10–15% above average | Clear differentiation, strong brand |

**Launch pricing formula**:
```
Floor price = COGS × 1.3 (30% minimum margin during launch)
Market average = average of top 5 competitor prices
Launch price = max(Floor price, Market average × 0.85)
```

### Stage 2: Growth Pricing (60–180 days)
**Goal**: Balance velocity and margin

- Raise price $1–2 every 2 weeks as reviews accumulate
- Stop raising when sales velocity drops >15%
- Target: get to your "full price" within 90 days of launch

### Stage 3: Mature Pricing (180+ days)
**Goal**: Maximize profit, defend position

- Monitor competitor prices weekly
- Reprice within a defined band (floor to ceiling)
- Use promotions to stimulate volume during slow periods

### Stage 4: Declining (Low BSR, high competition)
**Goal**: Liquidate cleanly or relaunch

- Drop price to move inventory before storage fees spike
- Consider removal if margin-negative

## Buy Box Strategy

### How Amazon Decides Buy Box Winner (Private Label)
For your own brand (no other sellers): You win Buy Box if:
- Account Health is Good
- You have FBA inventory available
- Price is competitive vs. your own historical pricing
- Not flagged for high-price violation

### Buy Box for Resellers (Multi-Seller Competition)
Amazon's algorithm weights:
1. **Price** (most important) — lowest landed price often wins
2. **Fulfillment method** — FBA beats FBM
3. **Seller metrics** — ODR, late shipment rate
4. **Inventory availability** — in-stock wins
5. **Account health** — healthy accounts preferred

**Repricing rules for Buy Box:**
```
IF (my price > lowest FBA competitor price + $0.50):
  → Lower price by $0.25
IF (I'm winning Buy Box and margin > target):
  → Try raising price by $0.10 every 24 hours
IF (price hits floor):
  → Stop repricing, accept lower Buy Box share
```

## Price Floor Calculation

Never price below your floor. Calculate it:

```
Minimum viable price = COGS + Amazon fees + minimum profit

Example (Standard product, $9 COGS):
COGS:                    $9.00
Referral fee (15%):      $X × 15%
FBA fee:                 $3.22 (large standard, 1lb)
Min profit target:       $2.00
─────────────────────────────
Solve: Price = COGS + FBA + (Price × 0.15) + Min Profit
Price = (9 + 3.22 + 2) / (1 - 0.15) = $16.73 floor
```

## Promotional Pricing Playbook

### Lightning Deals
- Minimum discount: 15–20% off regular price
- Amazon selects eligible products (can't self-submit all products)
- Best timing: Prime Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday
- Cost: $150–$300 per deal slot (varies by event)
- ROI: Best for BSR ranking boost, not pure profit

### Coupons
- Clip-and-save badge improves CTR (green badge visible in search)
- Set 5–20% discount (lower amounts still get the badge)
- Cost: $0.60 per redemption
- Best for: Driving trial on new products, price-sensitive categories

### Prime Exclusive Discounts
- Only shown to Prime members
- Requires: 10%+ discount, 3+ star rating
- Shows strikethrough price in search — strong CTR driver

### BOGO / Multi-unit
- "Buy 2, get 10% off" — increases average order value
- Good for consumables, multi-pack strategy

## Price Elasticity Framework

Without sales data, estimate elasticity by category:

| Category Type | Elasticity | Meaning |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Commodity (generic, many sellers) | High | Small price drop → big volume gain |
| Differentiated (brand, unique features) | Low | Price changes don't move volume much |
| Gift / impulse | Medium | Sweet spot pricing matters |
| Consumable / repeat purchase | Low-Medium | Loyalty reduces price sensitivity |

**To measure your elasticity**:
1. Raise price $2 for 2 weeks, note sales change
2. Drop price $2 for 2 weeks, note sales change
3. Calculate: % change in units / % change in price = elasticity coefficient

## Seasonal Pricing Calendar

| Period | Strategy |
|--------|---------|
| Jan–Feb | Hold or slight discount (post-holiday slowdown) |
| Mar–Apr | Restore full price, spring categories up |
| May–Jun | Stable, prep Prime Day inventory |
| Jul (Prime Day) | Deep discounts day-of, price back up after |
| Aug–Sep | Hold price, prep Q4 |
| Oct | Price up 5–10% before holiday rush |
| Nov (BFCM) | Lightning deals, coupons, max promotion |
| Dec 1–15 | Hold premium price (urgent gift buyers) |
| Dec 16–25 | Drop price to clear remaining inventory |

## Output Format

1. **Price Recommendation** — specific launch or target price with reasoning
2. **Floor Price Calculation** — your absolute minimum viable price
3. **Repricing Rules** — min/max band and trigger conditions
4. **Competitive Positioning** — where you sit vs. top 5 competitors
5. **Promo Calendar** — recommended discount events for next 90 days
