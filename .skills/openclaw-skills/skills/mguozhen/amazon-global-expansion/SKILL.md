## Market Entry Priority Framework

Score each market:
1. **Market size** (1-3): Revenue potential
2. **Competition** (1-3): How saturated is your category?
3. **Operational ease** (1-3): Language, compliance, logistics complexity
4. **Synergy with current ops** (1-3): Can you reuse existing inventory/listings?

**Start with highest total score.**

**Typical recommended sequence:**
1. Canada (lowest effort, shares US FBA network via NARF)
2. UK (English, large market, EU-independent post-Brexit)
3. Germany (largest EU market)
4. France -> Italy -> Spain (bundle via Pan-European FBA)

## VAT Requirements by Market

### European Union
- **Threshold eliminated** since July 2021 -- VAT required from first sale
- Register in each country OR use OSS (One Stop Shop) for B2C sales <=10,000/market
- If using Pan-European FBA: must register in all countries where Amazon stores your inventory (typically DE, FR, IT, ES, PL, CZ)
- **Required documents**: Business registration, proof of trading

**Recommended services**: Taxjar, Avalara, Hellotax, SimplyVAT

### United Kingdom
- UK VAT separate from EU post-Brexit
- Register if sales >85,000/year OR if using Amazon FBA in UK (storage = nexus)
- HMRC registration: https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration
- **UK EORI number** required for importing goods

### Canada
- GST/HST registration required if revenue >CAD $30,000/year
- Quebec has separate QST
- Much simpler than EU -- single federal system

### Japan
- Consumption Tax (10%) registration required
- Japanese business address or local representative may be needed
- JCT registration via NTA (National Tax Agency)

## Listing Localization Requirements

### Germany (Most Important EU Market)
- **Language**: Must be in German -- Google Translate quality is NOT acceptable
- **Legal requirements**:
  - Manufacturer address in Germany/EU (or authorized rep)
  - CE marking mandatory for electronics, toys, PPE
  - WEEE registration (for electronics)
  - Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging
- **Cultural notes**: Germans value technical precision, certifications, thoroughness

### Japan (Unique Requirements)
- Japanese listing required (not just translation -- cultural adaptation)
- PSE mark for electronics (mandatory)
- Many product-specific certifications (food contact materials, cosmetics)
- Customer service response time expectations: within 24 hours, in Japanese
- Returns policy: Japanese customers expect hassle-free returns

### UK (Post-Brexit)
- **UKCA mark** replacing CE mark for many products
- UK Responsible Person required for regulated products
- UK EPR for packaging

## Pan-European FBA vs. Multi-Country Inventory

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Pan-EU FBA** | Amazon distributes inventory, faster delivery | VAT in 5-7 countries required |
| **EFN (European Fulfillment Network)** | Single country storage | Slower delivery, higher fees cross-border |
| **Multi-Country Inventory** | Control where stock goes | Manage inbound to each country |

**Recommendation for beginners**: Start with EFN (one country) -> upgrade to Pan-EU once VAT registered everywhere.

## Currency & Pricing Strategy

- Never just convert USD price to local currency (e.g., $29.99 -> 29.99 is wrong)
- Research local competitor pricing -- markets have different price points
- Factor in: local FBA fees (vary by market), VAT (included in displayed price in EU/UK), exchange rate fluctuation
- Price in "charm pricing" for local market: 24.99, 27.99, 2,980 yen
