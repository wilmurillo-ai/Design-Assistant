## What Data to Provide

- **Brand name** — the name you plan to register/use
- **Product type** — category helps identify relevant patents
- **Keywords** — your title and PPC keyword list
- **Product images** — describe them (logos, characters, designs)
- **Market** — US, EU, UK, JP (trademark jurisdiction varies)

## IP Risk Categories

### 1. Trademark Infringement
**Risk**: Using a name, logo, or slogan that another company owns.

**Where to check:**
- USPTO TESS: https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search
- EUIPO (EU): https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch
- Amazon Brand Registry conflict lookup

**Red flags:**
- Your brand name contains another registered trademark
- Similar-sounding name in the same product category
- Using competitor brand names in your title or bullets
- Keyword stuffing with brand names (e.g., "compatible with Nike")

**Safe practices:**
- Use "compatible with [Brand]" only if truthful and not misleading
- Never use brand names in your product title
- Register your own brand before launch

### 2. Patent Infringement
**Risk**: Your product design or mechanism is protected by an existing patent.

**Types of patents:**
| Type | Covers | How to Check |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Utility Patent | How something works | USPTO Patent Full-Text Search |
| Design Patent | How something looks | Google Patents, USPTO |
| Trade Dress | Overall commercial image | Harder to search — consult lawyer |

**High-risk categories** (frequent patent enforcement):
- Phone accessories (cases, mounts, chargers)
- Sports equipment (yoga, fitness)
- Kitchen gadgets
- Baby products
- Medical devices

**Patent search steps:**
1. Search USPTO at https://patents.google.com
2. Use product function keywords: "yoga mat alignment" not product name
3. Check filing date — patents expire after 20 years (utility) / 15 years (design)
4. Look for "continuation" patents — related to expired ones

### 3. Image Copyright
**Risk**: Using copyrighted images, characters, logos, or artwork.

**Automatic red flags:**
- Disney, Marvel, DC characters
- Sports team logos (NFL, NBA, MLB)
- Any cartoon character you didn't create
- Stock photos without commercial license
- Celebrity photos or names
- Song lyrics, book excerpts

**Safe image sources:**
- Photos you took yourself
- Canva Pro (commercial license included)
- Shutterstock, Getty (with commercial license)
- Public domain images (check carefully)

### 4. Amazon Policy Violations
Beyond legal IP, Amazon has additional restrictions:

| Violation | Risk |
|-----------|------|
| Brand name keyword stuffing | Listing suppression |
| Fake "brand" (no actual brand) | Account warning |
| Counterfeit products | Permanent ban |
| False "Amazon's Choice" claims | Immediate takedown |
| Misleading compatibility claims | ASIN removal |
