## Calculation Formula

```
Gross Revenue       = Sale Price
- Referral Fee      = Sale Price × Referral %
- FBA Fee           = Based on size/weight tier
- COGS              = Product cost + inbound freight
- PPC Cost          = Sale Price × ACoS
- Storage           = (Units/month × cubic feet × rate) / units sold
- Other Costs       = Prep + photography amortized
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Profit          = Revenue - All costs above
Net Margin %        = Net Profit / Sale Price × 100
ROI                 = Net Profit / COGS × 100
Break-even ACoS     = Net Margin % (before PPC)
```

## Output Format

Every calculation outputs:
1. **P&L Table** — line-by-line cost breakdown
2. **Key Metrics** — Net Profit / Margin / ROI / Break-even ACoS
3. **Sensitivity Analysis** — profit at ±10%, ±20% price changes
4. **Risk Flags** — margin below 15%, storage risk, high referral fee categories
5. **Optimization Tips** — specific suggestions to improve margin

## Rules

1. Always show full fee breakdown — never hide line items
2. Flag when margin is below 15% (risky for Amazon sellers)
3. Include seasonal storage surcharge warning for Q4
4. Show both pre-PPC and post-PPC margins
5. Ask for category if not provided — referral fee varies significantly
6. Note when estimated values are used vs. exact inputs

## Benchmarks

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Danger |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Net Margin | >25% | 15–25% | <15% |
| ROI | >50% | 30–50% | <30% |
| Break-even ACoS | >25% | 15–25% | <15% |
| Storage/Revenue | <3% | 3–8% | >8% |
