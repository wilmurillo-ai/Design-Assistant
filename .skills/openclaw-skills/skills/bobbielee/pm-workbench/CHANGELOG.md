## v1.1.3 — PM workbench onboarding, command paths, and proof-chain tightening

### Added

- new cold-start entry asset:
  - `START_HERE.md`
- new routing and entry assets:
  - `docs/SCENARIO-ROUTER.md`
  - `docs/10-REAL-ENTRY-PROMPTS.md`
- new command-path docs:
  - `docs/COMMANDS.md`
  - `docs/COMMANDS.zh-CN.md`
- new command references:
  - `references/commands/clarify-then-evaluate.md`
  - `references/commands/clarify-then-compare.md`
  - `references/commands/prioritize-roadmap-exec.md`
  - `references/commands/prd-metrics-exec.md`
  - `references/commands/exec-then-postmortem.md`
- new command-path examples:
  - `examples/22-command-clarify-then-evaluate.md`
  - `examples/23-command-prioritize-roadmap-exec.md`
- new benchmark support assets:
  - `benchmark/command-benchmark-guide.md`
  - `benchmark/worked-example-command-mini.md`

### Improved

- tightened README and Chinese README onboarding so first-time visitors can enter through start-here, scenario, prompt, or command paths without turning the repo into a large skill library
- made command-style combinations visible in the main README narrative while keeping workflows as the core unit
- added standardized workflow metadata across the 9 workflow references to improve routing clarity and reduce misuse
- strengthened proof positioning so the benchmark layer now tests not only isolated workflow outputs, but also short multi-step PM chains
- extended validation coverage to the new onboarding docs, command docs, command references, proof assets, and release-version alignment

### Validated

- `npm run validate` passes locally after the onboarding / commands / benchmark tightening

### Notes

This version is about making `pm-workbench` feel more like a coherent OpenClaw-native PM workbench: easier to enter, easier to route, and easier to trust through visible multi-step proof.

---

## v1.1.2 — Bilingual README and visual system planning

### Added

- new Chinese README:
  - `README.zh-CN.md`
- planned bilingual README visual asset directories:
  - `assets/readme/en/`
  - `assets/readme/zh-CN/`
- placeholder notes inside the new README asset directories so future image production has a stable home

### Improved

- upgraded the local package version to `1.1.2` in `package.json`
- added a prominent language switch to `README.md` so GitHub visitors can jump to Chinese immediately
- documented the bilingual README structure so English and Chinese repo visitors can navigate with less friction
- clarified that README image production should follow a bilingual asset model instead of mixing all future visuals into the old path structure

### Notes

This version is focused on lowering GitHub discovery friction for Chinese-speaking visitors while preparing a cleaner bilingual README visual system for future image production.

---

## v1.1.0 — Workflow judgment sharpening

### Improved

- sharpened the 4 highest-signal core workflows with lighter framing / judgment cues:
  - `references/workflows/clarify-request.md`
  - `references/workflows/prioritize-requests.md`
  - `references/workflows/design-metrics.md`
  - `references/workflows/evaluate-feature-value.md`
- strengthened `SKILL.md` so the skill can briefly suggest the right angle when the ask is still fuzzy, while staying workflow-first and artifact-first
- tightened `README.md` language so the added judgment behavior is clearer without turning the repo into a framework library

### Guardrails

- kept the repo structure unchanged for this release
- did not add new workflow paths, templates, examples, benchmark layers, or navigation surfaces
- kept the upgrade focused on sharper early judgment rather than broader framework coverage

### Validated

- `npm run validate` passes locally after the workflow judgment upgrade

### Notes

This version is about making `pm-workbench` less likely to jump into the wrong next step when the ask is still fuzzy, while keeping the repo tight, workflow-led, and reusable in real PM work.

---

## v1.0.6 — Install and pre-release check polish

### Added

- new short install checklist:
  - `docs/INSTALL-CHECKLIST.md`

### Improved

- made the source-first install path more explicit in:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`
  - `docs/TRY-IN-3-MINUTES.md`
- clarified the default path as **copy → validate → skills check** before first use or release
- strengthened repo validation coverage so the install-check doc is also guarded by local validation

### Validated

- `npm run validate` passes locally after the install-check polish

### Notes

This version is aimed at making `pm-workbench` easier to try, easier to verify after copying, and easier to sanity-check before source-first distribution.

---

## v1.0.5 — Decision-under-uncertainty hardening

### Added

- new higher-pressure examples:
  - `examples/20-launch-readiness-call.md`
  - `examples/21-mixed-signals-operating-review.md`
- new benchmark worked examples:
  - `benchmark/worked-example-launch-readiness.md`
  - `benchmark/worked-example-mixed-signals.md`

### Improved

- strengthened `SKILL.md` with a cross-workflow **conditional recommendation rule** so the skill is more likely to make a usable call under uncertainty instead of stopping at “needs more information”
- strengthened `SKILL.md` with a **leader-grade decision rule** focused on period objective, scarce-resource protection, and explicit non-decisions
- sharpened `compare-solutions` around decisive trade-offs, what the choice is protecting, why-not-the-other-option-now logic, and decide-now vs validate-next framing
- sharpened `prepare-exec-summary` around launch / readiness recommendation framing, decision-now vs validation-next, and clearer upward decision asks
- sharpened `build-roadmap` around scarce-resource protection, stronger not-now language, and clearer stage-goal defense
- sharpened `prioritize-requests` around scarce-resource framing, non-decision language patterns, and more explicit below-the-line logic
- strengthened the matching templates:
  - `references/templates/decision-brief.md`
  - `references/templates/exec-summary.md`
  - `references/templates/roadmap-one-pager.md`
  - `references/templates/head-of-product-operating-review.md`
- updated example and benchmark indexes so the new higher-pressure scenarios are discoverable from the repo surface

### Validated

- `npm run validate` passes locally after the decision-under-uncertainty upgrade

### Notes

This version is aimed at making `pm-workbench` feel less like a strong PM analyst and more like a stronger product-leadership workbench under uncertainty, conflict, and pressure.

---

## v1.0.3 — High-pressure acceptance suite

### Added

- new benchmark pressure-test asset:
  - `benchmark/high-pressure-acceptance-suite.md`

### Improved

- extended the benchmark layer from baseline comparison scenarios to harsher real-world acceptance testing
- added more conflict-heavy, ambiguity-heavy, leadership-heavy scenarios designed to reveal whether `pm-workbench` still holds judgment quality under pressure
- connected the pressure-test suite back into `benchmark/README.md` and `benchmark/scenarios.md` so it works as part of the repo’s visible evaluation path

### Notes

This version is about shifting from “looks strong in curated examples” toward “can survive messier real PM conditions.”

---

## v1.0.2 — Core judgment sharpening

### Improved

- sharpened `prepare-exec-summary` with clearer failure modes, stronger-output standards, and more explicit emphasis on decision ask, business consequence, and why-now logic
- sharpened `compare-solutions` with stronger standards for decisive trade-off framing, why-not-the-other-option reasoning, and staged-path judgment
- sharpened `build-roadmap` with clearer standards for sequencing logic, explicit non-focus calls, and resource-constrained stage framing
- strengthened the matching templates:
  - `references/templates/exec-summary.md`
  - `references/templates/decision-brief.md`
  - `references/templates/roadmap-one-pager.md`
- updated core examples so the repo’s visible examples better reflect the newer judgment bar:
  - `examples/03-exec-summary.md`
  - `examples/06-decision-brief.md`
  - `examples/08-roadmap-one-pager.md`

### Validated

- `npm run validate` passes locally after the workflow and template upgrades

### Notes

This version is focused on making the core workflow layer feel less like “good structure” and more like “stronger PM judgment under real constraints.”

---

## v1.0.1 — Proof and onboarding hardening

### Added

- new ultra-fast onboarding asset:
  - `docs/TRY-IN-3-MINUTES.md`
- new workflow-map visual:
  - `docs/images/pm-workbench-workflow-map.svg`
- new high-tension case-study examples:
  - `examples/15-case-study-boss-wow-factor.md`
  - `examples/16-case-study-gimmick-feature.md`
  - `examples/17-case-study-quarterly-priority-conflict.md`
- new bad-input correction examples:
  - `examples/18-bad-input-reframed.md`
  - `examples/19-bad-priority-input-corrected.md`

### Improved

- tightened README first screen around value proposition, fit, fastest trial path, and differentiation from generic AI
- added clearer in-scope / out-of-scope boundary so the repo reads like a focused product, not a drifting strategy dump
- upgraded benchmark README with fairness-control notes and explicit benchmark limitations
- upgraded benchmark worked examples so they more clearly show original input, representative generic AI pattern, representative `pm-workbench` pattern, judgment-vs-format distinction, and benchmark caveats
- sharpened the 3 highest-signal workflows:
  - `clarify-request`
  - `evaluate-feature-value`
  - `prioritize-requests`
- added clearer failure-mode and strong-output standards to the most important workflows
- strengthened `SKILL.md` with an explicit anti-template rule so artifact quality does not replace judgment quality
- improved `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to make adoption and extension paths faster and more coherent
- rewrote `ROADMAP.md` around product evolution logic: trust -> core judgment -> expansion

### Validated

- `npm run validate` passes locally after the upgrade

### Notes

This version is mainly about making `pm-workbench` easier to trust, easier to try quickly, and more obviously differentiated on core PM judgment.
