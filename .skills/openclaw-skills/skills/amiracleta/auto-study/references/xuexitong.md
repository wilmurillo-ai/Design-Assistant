## Use this file when

The current task is on Xuexitong / Chaoxing

## Default profile

Use profile:

```bash
xuexitong
```

## Site
`https://i.chaoxing.com/`

## Behavior

- Do not enter a full-screen homework page.
- Do not perform actions that a normal user could not perform.
- Use this `references`, you must **strictly** follow the process and guidance (**especially you** - Codex !!!).

## Chapter quiz

**Do not skip the process unless explicitly instructed otherwise; just follow it.**

This workflow is mandatory whenever you answer a chapter quiz.
**Required** order:
1. `locate questions`
2. `answering workflow`
3. `apply answers on page` (if needed)
4. `submission workflow` (if needed)

### Locate Questions

#### Target page structure
- The title may be `学生学习页面` or `studentstudy`
- Outer wrapper page: `studentstudy`
- The top-level page contains the main content `iframe` `#iframe`

#### What to do
- **First**, click a chapter link to enter the target page, or continue if you are already on it.
- You do not need to analyze the full page; it is enough to detect `studentstudy` and `iframe` -> `#iframe`.
- If the `#iframe` sub-document title is `视频` instead of `章节测验`, click `章节测验` to switch from the video page to the quiz page, with a URL like `/mooc-ans/knowledge/cards?...&num=1...`.

### Answering Workflow

1. Take a full-page(with --full) screenshot and immediately save the picture to `workspace/quiz/picture//[platform(xuexitong)]-[chapter].xxx` before doing anything else.
2. Read the questions from the screenshot rather than from the DOM, then immediately record them in markdown and save the file to `workspace/quiz/markdown/[platform(xuexitong)]-[chapter].md`(for example `xuexitong-10.3-以世界为方法.md`) before moving to the next step.
3. Read the markdown file, carefully analyze each question one by one, and immediately append the final answers to the end of the file before proceeding any further.

### Apply Answers On Page (if required)

- **Do not** apply answers on page until the markdown file has been created and the final answers have been appended to it.

1. Actual `iframe` path to the quiz content
   `#iframe` -> `work/index.html` -> `#frame_content` -> `doHomeWorkNew`
2. In the innermost document, locate the question blocks.
   Prefer `#form1` `.TiMu.newTiMu`.
3. Inside each question block, locate the target option.
   The option node is usually `li.font-cxsecret.before-after`.
   The option label is usually in `.num_option`, such as A or B.
4. Before clicking, check whether it is already selected.
   Avoid duplicate clicks.
5. After each applied answer, verify that the hidden answer input for that question matches the intended markdown answer.

### Submission Workflow (if required)

- **Do not** submit until the applied answers on page have been verified against the markdown answers.

1. **Submission cannot be undone**, so carefully verify that **all options** have `check_answer` or that the hidden answer input `answer<questionId>` already has a value.
2. Trigger the native submit control on the innermost page.
   Prefer clicking `a.btnSubmit` on the page.
   If the page uses a built-in function flow, you may also call the native submit flow, such as `btnBlueSubmit()`.
3. Handle the confirmation popup.
   A second confirmation dialog usually appears, often in an outer document.
   Check the confirm button in the top-level or outer page, such as `#popok`, then confirm again.
4. If the innermost URL changes to include `selectWorkQuestionYiPiYue`, submission is successful.
5. Finally, write the actual score at the end of the markdown file you just created.
