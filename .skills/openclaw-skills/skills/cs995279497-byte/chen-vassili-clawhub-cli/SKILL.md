# ClawHub CLI Assistant

Help developers manage OpenClaw skills with the ClawHub CLI.

Give exact commands first, keep explanations short, and prefer
step-by-step instructions the user can run directly.

## Quick Start

```bash
clawhub install <skill-slug>
clawhub inspect <owner>/<skill>
clawhub publish . --slug my-skill --name "My Skill" --version 1.0.0 --tags latest
Best For
Skill authors

ClawHub publishers

OpenClaw users managing local skills

Developers troubleshooting CLI workflows

Install a skill	clawhub install <skill-slug>
Inspect a skill	clawhub inspect <owner>/<skill>
Update one skill	clawhub update <skill-slug>
Update all skills	clawhub update --all
Publish a local skill	clawhub publish .
Sync local skills	clawhub sync --all

Core Rules
text
1. Provide exact CLI commands first.
2. Prefer the shortest correct workflow.
3. Use official command forms only.
4. Mention required flags only when needed.
5. Distinguish local workspace actions from registry actions.
6. Suggest login early if auth may be the issue.
7. Do not invent unsupported commands or flags.
Common Commands
bash
clawhub search "calendar"
clawhub install <skill-slug>
clawhub inspect <owner>/<skill>
clawhub update <skill-slug>
clawhub update --all
clawhub list
clawhub publish .
clawhub sync --all
clawhub login
clawhub whoami
clawhub logout
Common Workflows
Publish

bash
clawhub publish . \
  --slug my-skill \
  --name "My Skill" \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --changelog "Initial release" \
  --tags latest
Release a New Version

bash
clawhub publish . \
  --slug my-skill \
  --name "My Skill" \
  --version 1.1.0 \
  --changelog "Improved workflow and documentation" \
  --tags latest
Install

bash
clawhub install <skill-slug>
clawhub install <skill-slug> --version 1.2.0
clawhub install <skill-slug> --force
Update

bash
clawhub update <skill-slug>
clawhub update --all
clawhub update <skill-slug> --version 1.2.0
Sync

bash
clawhub sync --dry-run
clawhub sync --all
clawhub sync --all --bump patch --changelog "Maintenance update" --tags latest
Troubleshooting
Auth

bash
clawhub whoami
clawhub login
clawhub login --token <token>
SKILL.md Missing

text
- Ensure SKILL.md exists
- Ensure it is in the root of the skill folder
- Ensure the publish path points to that folder
Wrong Working Directory

bash
clawhub --workdir /path/to/project publish ./my-skill
Local Files Do Not Match Published Version

bash
clawhub update <skill-slug> --force
Useful Notes
A skill is a folder with a SKILL.md file, and ClawHub stores published skills as versioned bundles with metadata, tags, and changelogs. [page:0]
By default, the CLI installs into ./skills under the current working directory, or falls back to the configured OpenClaw workspace unless --workdir or CLAWHUB_WORKDIR overrides it. [page:0]
OpenClaw picks up workspace skills in the next session, so users should restart after install or update. [page:0]

Tips
Use clawhub whoami before troubleshooting auth or publish issues.

Use clawhub sync --dry-run before bulk publishing.

Prefer explicit --slug, --name, and --version for releases.

Use --workdir when the current directory is not the correct project root.

Use clawhub update --all for installed skills and clawhub sync --all for local publish workflows.
