# Sopaper Evidence

Sopaper Evidence is an evidence-first research skill. Its job is to build a reliable evidence pack before supporting any downstream paper outline, abstract, related work summary, experiment plan, or draft section.

Version: `v1.0.0`

## Upstream source

Canonical repository: `https://github.com/sheepxux/SoPaper-Evidence`

This published skill bundle includes the helper scripts it references under `scripts/`. The GitHub repository remains the public source of truth for releases, examples, and issue tracking.

## Use this skill when

- The user wants to turn a project into a paper without inventing evidence
- The task requires finding prior papers, datasets, benchmarks, baselines, or case studies
- The task requires mapping claims to verified sources
- The task requires identifying evidence gaps before writing
- The user wants related work or experiment planning grounded in real sources

## Hard rules

- Do not fabricate papers, authors, venues, dates, citations, datasets, benchmarks, experiments, or numerical results
- Prefer primary sources over summaries, reposts, or blog interpretations
- Separate verified facts from inference and open questions
- If evidence is missing, say it is missing and recommend what to collect next
- Do not state that the user's method outperforms baselines unless there is explicit evidence
- Every writing-oriented output must be traceable to evidence items

## Source priority

Use the highest-quality source available for each claim.

1. User-provided project artifacts: experiment logs, tables, code, configs, internal notes
2. Primary external sources: papers, official docs, benchmark leaderboards, dataset pages, project repos
3. Secondary summaries: blogs, news posts, third-party explainers

Read [references/source-priority.md](references/source-priority.md) when source quality or conflicts matter.
Read [references/input-schemas.md](references/input-schemas.md) when stronger input structure is needed before running the workflow.

## Core workflow

### 1. Scope the task

Collect or infer:

- Project name
- Research topic
- Core problem
- Method summary
- Existing evidence and file paths
- Target venue or paper style if known

If the project scope is unclear, produce a short working scope and label assumptions.

### 2. Search for evidence

Search for:

- Prior work
- Benchmarks and datasets
- Baseline methods
- Comparable case studies
- Official metrics definitions
- Relevant project artifacts in the local repository

For each source, capture the title, URL or path, source type, and why it matters.

Use [references/prior-work-search-playbook.md](references/prior-work-search-playbook.md) for a repeatable search process.
For OpenClaw-specific work, use [references/openclaw-evidence-playbook.md](references/openclaw-evidence-playbook.md).

### 3. Verify and classify

For each evidence item, classify it as:

- `verified_fact`
- `project_evidence`
- `inference`
- `unverified`

Do not merge these labels. If a statement depends on inference, say so explicitly.

### 4. Extract structured evidence

Use the schema in [references/evidence-schema.md](references/evidence-schema.md).

At minimum, extract:

- Claim or observation
- Source
- Evidence type
- Scope and limitations
- Relevance to the user's paper

### 5. Build the evidence map

Organize findings into:

- `related_work`
- `datasets_and_benchmarks`
- `baselines`
- `case_studies`
- `project_results`
- `claim_to_evidence`
- `evidence_gaps`

Use [assets/claim-evidence-map-template.md](assets/claim-evidence-map-template.md) when the user needs a reusable deliverable.
Use [assets/related-work-matrix-template.md](assets/related-work-matrix-template.md) when comparing papers, baselines, and benchmark coverage.
Use [assets/experiment-gap-report-template.md](assets/experiment-gap-report-template.md) when the task requires prioritizing missing experiments before drafting.
Use bundled `scripts/build_evidence_ledger.py` when the user already has markdown notes or source lists and needs a first-pass evidence ledger.
Use bundled `scripts/generate_search_plan.py` when the user starts only with a topic and needs a first-pass evidence search plan.
Use bundled `scripts/generate_topic_claims.py` when the user starts only with a topic and needs a cautious structured claims draft.
Use bundled `scripts/search_external_sources.py` when the user needs a first-pass source list from a topic or search plan.
Use bundled `scripts/fetch_external_sources.py` when raw URLs should be converted into structured source-note drafts before review.
Use bundled `scripts/verify_source_notes.py` when fetched notes should be conservatively upgraded into page-level verified facts or reviewed primary-source summaries before entering the ledger.
Use bundled `scripts/run_evidence_pipeline.py` when the user already has source files, claims, and optional result artifacts and wants one end-to-end draft pack. Result artifacts may be structured markdown, `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.json`, and multiple result artifacts can be fused into aggregate project evidence.
Use bundled `scripts/bootstrap_claim_map.py` when the user already has a claims list and a ledger draft and needs a first-pass claim map.
Use bundled `scripts/triage_evidence_gaps.py` when the user needs a first-pass blocker/major/minor gap report from the current claims and evidence ledger.
Use bundled `scripts/review_comparison_fairness.py` when the user needs a dedicated fairness check on comparative claims, baseline breadth, metric grounding, and scope alignment.
Use bundled `scripts/run_topic_evidence_pipeline.py` when the user wants the full topic-driven workflow from theme to search plan, source list, fetched notes, ledger, claim map, and gap report.
Use bundled `scripts/validate_input_bundle.py` when the user has partially structured inputs and needs a quick schema check before running the pipeline.

### 6. Support writing

Only after the evidence map is complete, support tasks such as:

- contribution candidates
- related work summary
- abstract support points
- experiment plan
- paper outline

Before writing, run the checks in [references/claim-audit-rules.md](references/claim-audit-rules.md).
Use [assets/paper-outline-from-evidence-template.md](assets/paper-outline-from-evidence-template.md) when the user needs a draft-safe paper structure.

## Output requirements

Unless the user asks for something else, default to this output shape:

1. `Evidence brief`
2. `Key sources`
3. `Claim-to-evidence map`
4. `Evidence gaps`
5. `Safe writing notes`
6. `Experiment gap report` when blocker gaps exist

- [examples/openclaw-paper-outline.md](examples/openclaw-paper-outline.md)

## Writing constraints

When supporting downstream paper writing:

- Tie each major claim to one or more evidence items
- Avoid precise quantitative wording unless the number is verified
- Mark missing comparisons, missing ablations, and missing real-world validation
- Prefer conservative wording over overstated conclusions

## OpenClaw-specific guidance

When the user is working on OpenClaw or a similar embodied AI / robotics project, prioritize:

- manipulation benchmarks
- long-horizon task evidence
- policy or planner comparisons
- real-world versus simulation evidence
- ablations on perception, planning, or control components

Do not assume OpenClaw has capabilities, datasets, or benchmark wins unless they are present in project artifacts or verified sources.
Use [references/benchmark-baseline-checklist.md](references/benchmark-baseline-checklist.md) before accepting benchmark-fit or baseline coverage claims.
Use [references/evidence-gap-triage.md](references/evidence-gap-triage.md) when deciding whether to keep drafting or stop and report blockers.
