## Layer 5 — Within-Session Coherence Degradation (Shipped 2026-03-05)

Layer 5 is the coherence monitor. It solves a problem distinct from AI amnesia: the AI
*remembers* who it is across sessions (Layers 1–4), but within a single long session, its
behavior can drift as its instructions get buried deep in the context window.

**The signal:** Scratchpad dropout. The AI is required to execute a ReAct reasoning loop
(`<scratchpad>...</scratchpad>`) before every complex action. When context depth increases,
the instruction to use the scratchpad gets pushed far back in the window — attention
weakens, and the AI stops using it. This is a binary, measurable signal.

**The fix:** `coherence_monitor.py` runs inside SENTINEL's watchdog loop every 5 minutes.
It checks the last 10 turns for scratchpad presence relative to context depth. If dropout
is detected at the wrong depth threshold, it writes a `reanchor_pending.json` payload.
`Invoke-ReAnchor` picks this up and injects a targeted re-anchor block into `BOOT_CONTEXT.md`
before the next session compiles. The AI course-corrects on the next context load.

**Shipped:** 33/33 tests passing against live session data. Three post-ship bugs found and
fixed within 24 hours (accumulation bug, ghost hits, re-anchor storm) — all documented below.

---

## [2026-03-06] SENTINEL `Invoke-ReAnchor` accumulates blocks in BOOT_CONTEXT.md

### Symptom
`BOOT_CONTEXT.md` grows by ~200 tokens after every re-anchor event and never
shrinks back. Over multiple sessions, the file accumulates stacked re-anchor blocks:

```
## Re-Anchor Injection (2026-03-05T16:38:56)
... content ...

---

## Re-Anchor Injection (2026-03-05T16:43:57)
... content ...
```

Adam's response latency increases. Eventually gateway timeouts appear as
`stopReason: "error"` turns. The coherence monitor reads these zero-input-token
turns as further drift evidence, creating a compounding loop.

### Root Cause
`Invoke-ReAnchor` in `SENTINEL.template.ps1` (and live SENTINEL instances) used
`Add-Content` to append the re-anchor section to `BOOT_CONTEXT.md`:
```powershell
Add-Content -Path $bootContext -Value $section -Encoding UTF8
```
`Add-Content` appends — it never removes old blocks. Every triggered re-anchor
stacks on top of all previous ones. There was no cleanup mechanism.

Additionally, the timestamp header referenced `$pending.timestamp` — a field that
does not exist in `reanchor_pending.json`. The correct field is `created_at`.
Every injection showed a blank timestamp in the header.

### Fix Applied
Replace `Add-Content` with read → strip → write pattern in `Invoke-ReAnchor`:
```powershell
$existing = Get-Content $bootContext -Raw -Encoding UTF8
$existing = $existing -replace "(?s)\r?\n---\r?\n## Re-Anchor Injection.*$", ""
$existing = $existing.TrimEnd()
$timestamp = if ($pending.created_at) { $pending.created_at } else { (Get-Date -Format "o") }
$section   = "`n`n---`n`n## Re-Anchor Injection ($timestamp)`n`n$($pending.content)"
Set-Content -Path $bootContext -Value ($existing + $section) -Encoding UTF8
```

The `-replace` regex strips everything from the first `## Re-Anchor Injection`
header to end-of-file, then writes the new block cleanly. Result: one re-anchor
block maximum at any time, regardless of how many events fire in a session.

### Recovery Steps
If `BOOT_CONTEXT.md` has already accumulated stale blocks:
1. Run SENTINEL boot — the compile step rewrites `BOOT_CONTEXT.md` from scratch
2. Or manually: open `BOOT_CONTEXT.md`, delete all `## Re-Anchor Injection` sections
3. Verify with line count: healthy `BOOT_CONTEXT.md` should be ~350-500 lines

### Key Insight
> **`Add-Content` in a watchdog loop is always accumulation.** Any file that gets
> written repeatedly by a watchdog needs either a rewrite (`Set-Content`) or a
> strip-then-rewrite pattern. Never append-only to files that should stay bounded.

---

## [2026-03-06] Re-anchor content containing `<scratchpad>` causes ghost coherence hits

### Symptom
Coherence monitor reports `Scratchpad in last 10 turns: True` even in sessions
where the model has clearly stopped using its scratchpad. Re-anchors don't fire
when they should. The session drifts silently.

Alternatively: scratchpad check returns `True` immediately after a re-anchor
injection, masking the dropout that triggered the re-anchor in the first place.

### Root Cause
`build_reanchor_content()` extracted a block from `AGENTS.md` that included the
literal string `<scratchpad>` — the re-anchor instruction telling the model to
re-engage its reasoning loop. When SENTINEL injected this into `BOOT_CONTEXT.md`,
`check_scratchpad()` found the tag in the injected block and scored the session
coherent regardless of what the model was actually doing in its responses.

The detection target (`<scratchpad>`) was appearing in the injection payload itself.

### Fix Applied
Strip the literal tag from all extracted content before writing to
`reanchor_pending.json`:
```python
SCRATCHPAD_TAG = "<scratchpad>"
SCRATCHPAD_PLACEHOLDER = "[SCRATCHPAD_LOOP_INSTRUCTION]"
extracted = extracted.replace(SCRATCHPAD_TAG, SCRATCHPAD_PLACEHOLDER)
```
The placeholder preserves the semantic instruction without triggering the detector.
The fallback string was also sanitized to remove its inline `<scratchpad>` reference.

### Key Insight
> **The injection payload and the detection signal must be disjoint.** If your
> coherence detector looks for string X, never let string X appear in the content
> you inject in response to detecting its absence. This is a self-referential
> detection trap — the cure becomes indistinguishable from the disease.

## [2026-03-06] `write_reanchor_trigger` race causes re-anchor storm

### Symptom
BOOT_CONTEXT.md receives a new re-anchor block on every 5-minute coherence cycle
even after the first re-anchor was consumed. Sentinel log shows:
```
[SENTINEL] Re-anchor injected into BOOT_CONTEXT.md (previous blocks cleaned)
[SENTINEL] Coherence monitor: drift detected — re-anchor pending.
[SENTINEL] Re-anchor injected into BOOT_CONTEXT.md (previous blocks cleaned)
```
Pattern repeats every 5 minutes. BOOT_CONTEXT.md keeps growing even with the
accumulation fix in place.

### Root Cause
Race between `coherence_monitor.py` and `Invoke-ReAnchor` in SENTINEL's watchdog
loop. The loop runs `Invoke-ReAnchor` first, then `Invoke-CoherenceCheck`. If the
session is still showing drift after the first re-anchor injection:

1. `Invoke-ReAnchor` marks `reanchor_pending.json` consumed
2. `Invoke-CoherenceCheck` runs coherence_monitor.py
3. coherence_monitor detects drift (session hasn't recovered yet)
4. `write_reanchor_trigger` writes a **new** `reanchor_pending.json`
5. Next cycle: `Invoke-ReAnchor` injects again → loop

Every 5-minute cycle produces one injection. The accumulation fix stops blocks
from stacking, but the file still gets a new block every cycle.

### Fix Applied
Added deduplication guard to `write_reanchor_trigger`: if `reanchor_pending.json`
exists with `consumed: false`, the function skips the write and returns `False`:
```python
if not existing.get("consumed", True):
    rlog("Re-anchor already pending — skipping duplicate write.")
    return False
```
A pending re-anchor can only be overwritten once SENTINEL has consumed it. The
coherence log distinguishes `reanchor_triggered` from `reanchor_skipped_pending`.

### Key Insight
> **In any producer-consumer pattern on a shared file, the producer must check
> whether the consumer has processed the previous message before writing a new one.**
> The `consumed` flag exists for exactly this purpose — use it on both sides.
> Without this guard, the coherence monitor is a re-anchor pump, not a re-anchor
> trigger.

## [2026-03-05] Invalid config key causes silent gateway reload loop

### Symptom
Gateway logs fill with:
```
[session-store] rename failed after 5 attempts: ...sessions.json
```
Heartbeat fails with `chat not found`. Sessions save inconsistently.
System appears to be running but behavior is degraded.

### Root Cause
An unrecognized key was present in `channels.telegram` in `openclaw.json`:
```json
"contacts": {
  "heartbeat": "-100xxxxxxxxxx:topic:1409"
}
```
OpenClaw's config validator rejected the key on every hot-reload with:
```
Invalid config: channels.telegram: Unrecognized key: "contacts"
config reload skipped (invalid config)
```
Because the config reload was failing, the gateway kept running on its stale
in-memory config — but every session write attempt hit a filesystem contention
cascade from the failed reload loop.

The `contacts` field does **not exist** in the `channels.telegram` schema.
It was added based on a reasonable assumption that proved incorrect.

### How To Route Heartbeats to a Telegram Topic
The correct schema is `agents.defaults.heartbeat` with `target` and `to` fields:

```json
"agents": {
  "defaults": {
    "heartbeat": {
      "every": "30m",
      "target": "telegram",
      "to": "-1003764282014:topic:1409",
      "activeHours": {
        "start": "07:00",
        "end": "24:00",
        "timezone": "America/New_York"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Telegram topics/threads the `to` format is `<chatId>:topic:<messageThreadId>`.

### How to Catch This Class of Error
If the gateway is running but behavior is degraded, always check:
```powershell
Get-Content C:\tmp\openclaw\openclaw-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').log |
  Select-String 'invalid config|config reload skipped|Unrecognized key'
```
Config validation errors do **not** crash the gateway — they fail silently and
leave the system running on stale config. You won't see an obvious crash.

### Fix Applied
- Removed `contacts` block from `channels.telegram`
- Added correct `agents.defaults.heartbeat` block with `target: "telegram"` and `to: "CHAT_ID:topic:THREAD_ID"`
- Updated `engine/openclaw.template.json` to reflect correct pattern
- Documented in `CHANGELOG.md` as v1.0.2

## [2026-03-05] session-store rename failures caused by MCP filesystem handle retention

### Symptom
Gateway logs continue to show:
```
[session-store] rename failed after 5 attempts: ...sessions.json
```
This persists even after fixing the invalid config key (see entry above).
Errors resume within seconds of every gateway restart.

### Root Cause
The Claude desktop app (or any MCP client with filesystem access) was holding
persistent open file handles on `sessions.json` via the Desktop Commander MCP
integration. Windows does not allow atomic rename operations (`fs.rename()`) when
the destination file is held open by another process — even a read handle blocks it.

Identified via Sysinternals `handle64.exe`:
```
handle64 -p <gateway_pid> sessions.json
```
Output showed `claude.exe` (PID 1076) with two open handles — acquired during
earlier diagnostic `read_file` calls in the same session — that were never released
because the MCP client holds handles for the lifetime of the conversation session.

This is a Windows-specific behavior. On Linux/macOS, rename over an open file
succeeds because inodes are unlinked, not locked. On Windows, the file must be
closed before it can be replaced.

### Fix Applied
Removed `.openclaw\agents` from Desktop Commander's `allowedDirectories` config:
```json
"allowedDirectories": [
  "C:\\Users\\AJSup\\Desktop",
  "C:\\Users\\AJSup\\adam-framework-public",
  "C:\\Users\\AJSup\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm",
  "C:\\AdamsVault",
  "C:\\Users\\AJSup\\.openclaw"
]
```
The sessions subdirectory is excluded — MCP tools can no longer open those files.
New sessions start clean with zero handles on the sessions directory.

### How To Diagnose This In Your Deployment
If rename errors persist after fixing config issues, run:
```powershell
# Download handle64 from Sysinternals if not present
# Then:
& "C:\path\to\handle64.exe" -p (Get-Process -Name "openclaw*").Id sessions.json
```
If any process other than the gateway itself has handles open, that's your culprit.
Scope it out of whatever filesystem access tool is holding it.

### Key Insight
> MCP filesystem integrations that allow broad directory access will acquire and
> hold read handles for the duration of the client session. On Windows this silently
> blocks atomic writes in those directories. Scope `allowedDirectories` precisely —
> only what actually needs to be touched, nothing broader.

## [2026-02-XX] SENTINEL watchdog failing to restart after crash

### Symptom
Gateway goes offline. SENTINEL scheduled task shows "last run failed."
System doesn't auto-recover.

### Root Cause
`openclaw.json` had an invalid key in the `mcp.servers` vs `mcpServers` namespace
(OpenClaw uses `mcp.servers`, not the `mcpServers` used by some other tools).
The gateway crashed on load rather than starting degraded, and SENTINEL's restart
logic couldn't distinguish a bad-config crash from a transient failure.

### Fix Applied
Corrected the MCP server key in `openclaw.json`. Added startup validation
to SENTINEL to check gateway health after restart before marking recovery complete.

---

## [2026-02-XX] Delivery queue filled with stale failed heartbeat entries

### Symptom
Heartbeat messages stop arriving in Telegram. No crash, no obvious error.
Gateway appears healthy.

### Root Cause
45 stale failed heartbeat delivery entries accumulated in the delivery queue
(`~/.openclaw/delivery/`). The queue processor was retrying them indefinitely,
backing up all new deliveries behind them.

### Fix Applied
Cleared stale entries from the delivery queue directory. Added queue inspection
to the regular health check routine.

---

## General Debugging Checklist

> **Platform note:** Commands below are PowerShell (Windows). On macOS/Linux, replace `Get-Content` with `cat`, `Select-String` with `grep`, and path separators with `/`.

When something breaks and you don't know where:

1. **Check the day's gateway log for config errors first:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\tmp\openclaw\openclaw-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').log |
     Select-String 'ERROR|invalid config|Unrecognized key|reload skipped'
   ```

2. **Validate `openclaw.json` is clean JSON before touching anything else:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\Users\YOU\.openclaw\openclaw.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json | Out-Null
   ```
   Any error here is your starting point.

3. **Check the delivery queue for buildup:**
   ```powershell
   (Get-ChildItem C:\Users\YOU\.openclaw\delivery\).Count
   ```
   More than ~5 files is a sign of queue backup.

4. **Confirm SENTINEL is running:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'OpenClaw*' | Select-Object TaskName, State, LastRunTime
   ```

5. **If config was recently changed:** assume the change is the cause. Revert first,
   verify the gateway recovers, then re-apply the change correctly.

---

## The Core Rule

> **The gateway fails silently on bad config. It does not crash — it just stops
> reloading and keeps running on stale state.**
>
> If behavior is wrong but the process is alive, check the config first.

## [2026-03-05] SENTINEL vector reindex hitting nonexistent HTTP endpoint (405)

### Symptom
Every SENTINEL boot produces a non-fatal error in the log:
```
[SENTINEL] Vector reindex failed (non-fatal): The remote server returned an error: (405) Method Not Allowed.
```
System continues booting and Adam responds normally. But memory written by the
sleep cycle (reconcile run) is not indexed into the vector store — `memory_search`
misses content from the current cycle until a manual `openclaw memory index` is run.

### Root Cause
`SENTINEL.template.ps1` (and live SENTINEL instances built from it) called
`POST /api/memory/reindex` on the OpenClaw gateway after confirming gateway health.
That HTTP endpoint does not exist in OpenClaw. The gateway returns 405 Method Not
Allowed. OpenClaw does not expose a REST API for memory reindex operations.

### Fix
Replace the `Invoke-WebRequest` reindex block with a direct CLI call:

```powershell
# BEFORE (broken — endpoint does not exist)
$ocCfg   = Get-Content "$OPENCLAW_DIR\openclaw.json" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$token   = $ocCfg.gateway.auth.token
$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $token"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }
$body    = '{"scope":"vault","path":"' + $VAULT_PATH + '"}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:18789/api/memory/reindex" `
    -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -TimeoutSec 30 -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null

# AFTER (correct — use the CLI directly)
$reindexResult = & openclaw memory index --agent main 2>&1 | Out-String
```

The CLI command `openclaw memory index --agent main` is the documented approach.
No HTTP endpoint, no auth token, no gateway dependency beyond it being live.

### How To Confirm
After applying the fix and restarting SENTINEL, the log should show:
```
[SENTINEL] Vector reindex triggered successfully.
```
instead of the 405 error.

### Key Insight
> **OpenClaw does not expose REST endpoints for all CLI operations.**
> When SENTINEL needs to trigger a gateway-side action, always check the CLI docs
> (`openclaw help <command>`) before assuming an HTTP route exists.
> `openclaw memory index`, `openclaw memory status`, etc. are CLI-only — not REST.

## [2026-03-05] coherence_monitor score_drift fall-through causes false positives and BOOT_CONTEXT bloat

### Symptom
Adam's response latency increases noticeably. Sentinel log shows drift detected and
re-anchor fired every 5 minutes even in active, coherent sessions:
```
[2026-03-05 16:38:56] Coherence check: exit 1
[2026-03-05 16:38:56] DRIFT DETECTED - consuming re-anchor...
[2026-03-05 16:43:57] Coherence check: exit 1
[2026-03-05 16:43:57] DRIFT DETECTED - consuming re-anchor...
```
BOOT_CONTEXT.md grows every 5 minutes. Running `coherence_monitor.py` directly
shows `Scratchpad in last 10 turns: True` alongside `Drift score: 0.9` — a
contradiction. Scratchpad active + maximum drift score = bug in the scorer.

### Root Cause
`score_drift()` used a chain of independent `if` statements rather than `if/elif/else`.
The function had four explicit branches but no coverage for `scratchpad_present=True`
with `CONTEXT_DRIFT_THRESHOLD <= context_pct < CONTEXT_WARN_THRESHOLD` (40–65%).

When context depth crossed 40%, all four `if` conditions evaluated to `False`:
- `scratchpad_present and context_pct < 0.40` → False (context too high)
- `scratchpad_present and context_pct >= 0.65` → False (context not high enough)
- `not scratchpad_present and ...` → False (scratchpad IS present)

With all branches missed, execution fell through to the final `return 0.9` catch-all
(intended for "scratchpad absent + high context"). Every session at 40%+ context with
an active scratchpad scored as maximum drift — the opposite of reality.

`should_reanchor()` also checked `context_pct >= CONTEXT_WARN_THRESHOLD` as an
independent trigger, meaning deep context alone could fire re-anchor even when the
scratchpad was firing correctly.

### Cascade
False positive drift (exit 1) every 5 minutes → SENTINEL appends re-anchor block
(~200 tokens) to BOOT_CONTEXT.md → file grows from ~21KB to ~23KB → Adam loads
larger context on every message → response latency increases → eventually gateway
timeouts produce `stopReason: "error"` turns with `usage.input: 0` → coherence
monitor reads zero tokens as further evidence of drift → loop continues.

### Fix
Replaced chained `if` statements with exhaustive `if/elif/else` on the
`scratchpad_present` branch:

```python
# BEFORE (broken — fall-through to catch-all)
if scratchpad_present and context_pct < CONTEXT_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
    return 0.0
if scratchpad_present and context_pct >= CONTEXT_WARN_THRESHOLD:
    return 0.4
if not scratchpad_present and context_pct < CONTEXT_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
    return 0.3
...
return 0.9  # ← was hit for scratchpad_present=True, 40-65% context

# AFTER (exhaustive — no fall-through possible)
if scratchpad_present:
    if context_pct < CONTEXT_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:   return 0.0
    elif context_pct < CONTEXT_WARN_THRESHOLD:  return 0.2  # new branch
    else:                                        return 0.4
else:
    if context_pct < CONTEXT_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:   return 0.3
    elif context_pct < CONTEXT_WARN_THRESHOLD:  return 0.6
    else:                                        return 0.9
```

`should_reanchor()` simplified to `return drift_score >= 0.6` — context depth alone
never triggers re-anchor when the scratchpad is firing.

### Recovery Steps
1. Apply fix to `tools/coherence_monitor.py`
2. Clear any pending re-anchor: open `workspace/reanchor_pending.json`, set `consumed: true`
3. Recompile BOOT_CONTEXT.md cleanly (run SENTINEL boot or manually execute the
   compile block from `SENTINEL.ps1`)
4. Verify: `python tools/coherence_monitor.py` should return exit 0 with
   `Drift score: 0.2` (not 0.9) for a healthy mid-context session

### How To Detect This Class of Error
If coherence monitor fires exit 1 repeatedly but logs show `Scratchpad... True`:
```powershell
python tools\coherence_monitor.py
# If output shows "Scratchpad in last 10 turns: True" AND "Drift score: 0.9"
# that's a scorer bug, not real drift.
```
Check BOOT_CONTEXT.md line count — more than ~480 lines means re-anchor blocks
have been appended. Recompile it.

### Key Insight
> **A scoring function with independent `if` branches instead of `if/elif/else`
> will silently fall through to a catch-all when input falls in an unhandled range.
> Always verify scoring functions with exhaustive unit tests covering every branch,
> including boundary values.**

The missing test was `score_drift(True, 0.50)` — scratchpad present, mid-context.
That exact case is now in `test_coherence_monitor.py` as `test_scratchpad_present_mid_context`
and `test_no_fallthrough_exhaustive`. Test count: 27 → 30.

## [2026-03-05] Dual SENTINEL instances causing gateway watchdog loop

### Symptom
Gateway dies every 30-60 seconds. SENTINEL watchdog catches it and immediately
restarts — but the gateway dies again within the minute. Sentinel log shows repeated:
```
WARNING: Gateway process died. Restarting...
Gateway started - PID XXXXX
```
Killing and restarting SENTINEL seems to fix it but the problem returns.

### Root Cause
Two SENTINEL instances running simultaneously. One started manually (e.g., direct
PowerShell invocation for testing), a second spawned by Task Scheduler. Both
instances watch for a dead gateway — but each one's watchdog kills the gateway
process that the *other* started, because the gateway process was launched by the
other instance and has a different PID reference.

Both watchdogs see a dead process → both restart the gateway → both kill the other's
restart → loop repeats indefinitely at 30-second intervals.

### How To Diagnose
```powershell
Get-Process -Name "powershell" | Select-Object Id, StartTime, MainWindowTitle
```
If you see two powershell processes both with similar start times and no window
titles, you have a dual-SENTINEL situation. Confirm by checking:
```powershell
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\sentinel.log" -Tail 20
```
If the log shows gateway dying and restarting at exact 30s intervals, that's
the watchdog-vs-watchdog pattern.

### Fix
Kill the older SENTINEL process (lower PID = older). Keep the one started by
Task Scheduler — it's the authoritative one and will restart at next login.

```powershell
# Find the older PID and kill it
Stop-Process -Id <OLDER_PID> -Force
```

Gateway stabilizes immediately once only one watchdog is running.

### Prevention
Always check for running SENTINEL instances before launching manually:
```powershell
Get-Process -Name "powershell" | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -eq "" }
```
If any headless PowerShell processes exist, SENTINEL may already be running.
Check `sentinel.log` to confirm before launching a second instance.

## [2026-03-05] Kokoro TTS permanently removed

### Symptom
SENTINEL log fills with Kokoro restart attempts even when the system is otherwise
healthy. `kokoro.exe` or `python server.py` crashes silently, SENTINEL detects it
and restarts, it crashes again. No voice output. Loop continues indefinitely.

### Root Cause
Kokoro TTS has persistent stability issues — version mismatches, model file path
problems, port conflicts, and silent crashes that are difficult to diagnose. The
restart loop consumes log space and SENTINEL overhead without providing value.

### Resolution (Permanent)
Kokoro TTS removed from SENTINEL entirely. Edge TTS is the default voice layer —
it's stable, zero-config, no external process to monitor, and produces acceptable
quality for all current use cases.

`SENTINEL.template.ps1` v1.0.9 has zero Kokoro references. If you copied an older
version of the template, remove:
- `$USE_KOKORO`, `$PYTHON_EXE` (if only used for Kokoro), `$KOKORO_DIR`, `$KOKORO_LOG`, `$KOKORO_ERR` variables
- `Start-Kokoro` function
- The `if ($USE_KOKORO)` block in the process kill section
- The `$kokoro = Start-Kokoro` call after gateway launch
- The Kokoro watchdog restart block inside the while loop

Edge TTS requires no configuration — it's built into Windows and works out of the
box with OpenClaw's TTS provider block.

## [2026-03-08] `skills` key in openclaw.json causes immediate gateway crash loop

### Symptom
Gateway starts (SENTINEL logs "Gateway started - PID XXXXX") then immediately exits
with code 1. Watchdog restarts it every 30 seconds. Crash loop continues indefinitely.
Manually launching gateway shows:

```
Config invalid: Unrecognized key: "nano-banana-pro" in skills
```

or similar. No Telegram messages. Adam completely unreachable.

### Root Cause
A per-skill configuration block was added under the `skills` key in `openclaw.json`:

```json
"skills": {
  "nano-banana-pro": {
    "env": { "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-key-here" }
  }
}

OpenClaw does not support per-skill config entries under the top-level `skills` key.
The schema validator rejects any unrecognized key inside `skills` and returns exit code 1
before the gateway starts. Since the config is checked on every start, the watchdog
restart loop produces the same exit immediately every 30 seconds.

The crash is silent from SENTINEL's perspective — the log only shows process lifecycle
events, not gateway stderr. The crash reason is invisible until you launch the gateway
manually with output redirection.

### How To Diagnose
If gateway is crash-looping (starts and dies within seconds, repeating every 30s):

```powershell
# Launch gateway manually with stderr captured
$dir = "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw"
cmd /c "`"$dir\gateway.cmd`" > C:\tmp\gw_out.txt 2> C:\tmp\gw_err.txt"
Get-Content C:\tmp\gw_err.txt
```

Look for `Config invalid` or `Unrecognized key` in the output.

### Fix
Remove the `skills` block entirely from `openclaw.json`. Any API keys required by
skills should go in the top-level `env` block instead:

```json
"env": {
  "LLM_API_KEY": "...",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
}
```

The `skills` key in `openclaw.json` must remain empty `{}` or be omitted entirely.

### Secondary Issue Found (Same Session)
`channels.telegram.streamMode` was deprecated — renamed to `streaming`. A stale
`streamMode` key will not crash the gateway but will cause a non-fatal config warning.
Check with `openclaw doctor` if behavior is degraded but the gateway is alive.

### Prevention
Always validate config before restarting SENTINEL after any `openclaw.json` edit:
```powershell
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\openclaw.json" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json | Out-Null
```
If this throws, fix the config before SENTINEL restarts the gateway.

### Key Insight
> **OpenClaw's gateway crash on invalid config is immediate and silent.** It exits
> code 1 with no visible output unless you capture stderr manually. The watchdog
> has no way to distinguish a bad-config crash from a transient failure — it just
> keeps restarting. If you see the 30-second restart pattern, always check config
> before anything else.
>
> **Add stderr capture to SENTINEL** so future crashes are self-diagnosing. Redirect
> gateway output to a log file on launch — the reason will be in the first few lines.

## [2026-03-11] `memory_search` and `memory_get` return "Tool not found" despite memory-core plugin being registered

### Symptom
Adam calls `memory_search` or `memory_get` mid-session and receives:
```
Tool not found: memory_search
```
or the tool silently returns no results. The memory-core plugin appears registered
(`plugins.entries.memory-core.enabled: true`), the gateway is running, SENTINEL
shows no errors, and `openclaw memory status` reports the index is healthy.

Everything looks correct. The tools still don't work.

### Root Cause
Two separate issues, both required to fix — either one alone leaves the tools broken.

**Issue 1 — `agents.defaults.memorySearch.enabled` missing from `openclaw.json`**

OpenClaw's `resolveMemoryToolContext` reads its configuration from
`agents.defaults.memorySearch` — not from the plugin registry. When this block
exists but has no `enabled: true` key, the function receives `cfg = undefined`
and hits an early-exit guard:

```javascript
if (!cfg) return null;
```

Execution aborts before any plugin check or tool registration runs. The
`plugins.entries.memory-core.enabled: true` key is read by a completely separate
code path and has no effect on tool resolution. Both locations must have
`enabled: true`.

**Fix:** Add `"enabled": true` to the `agents.defaults.memorySearch` block in
`openclaw.json`:

```json
"agents": {
  "defaults": {
    "memorySearch": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sources": ["memory", "sessions"],
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Issue 2 — Wrong package name for desktop-commander in `mcporter.json`**

The `mcporter.json` desktop-commander entry used:
```json
"desktop-commander": {
  "command": "desktop-commander",
  "args": ["serve"]
}
```
The package `desktop-commander` does not exist on npm under that name. mcporter
fails silently — no crash, just "Tool not found" for every desktop-commander call.

**Fix:** Use the correct npx invocation:
```json
"desktop-commander": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest"]
}
```

**Issue 3 (same session) — Wrong module path for neural-memory**

`neural_memory.mcp_server` does not exist. The correct module path is
`neural_memory.mcp`. Using the wrong path causes a silent `ModuleNotFoundError`
on mcporter daemon start — no crash visible in the gateway log.

**Fix:**
```json
"neural-memory": {
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["-m", "neural_memory.mcp"],
  ...
}
```

### Why This Is Hard To Diagnose
- The gateway does not crash. It runs normally with the tools simply absent.
- `openclaw memory status` reports healthy — it checks the index, not tool registration.
- `plugins.entries.memory-core.enabled: true` looks correct and is correct — it's just
  not the config path that controls tool resolution.
- mcporter failures are silent. No error in the gateway log, no process crash.
- The symptom ("Tool not found") is identical for all three root causes.

### How To Confirm The Fix
After applying all three fixes and restarting the gateway:
1. In an Adam session, call `memory_search` with any query
2. It should return results (or "no results found" — not "Tool not found")
3. `memory_get` should similarly resolve without error

### Recovery Steps
1. Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — add `"enabled": true` to `agents.defaults.memorySearch`
2. Edit `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` — update desktop-commander to use `npx -y @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest`
3. Edit `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` — update neural-memory args to `["-m", "neural_memory.mcp"]`
4. Kill the gateway process (SENTINEL restarts it automatically within 30 seconds)
5. Restart mcporter daemon: `mcporter stop && mcporter start`
6. Verify in next session

### Key Insight
> **OpenClaw has two separate config paths for memory: the plugin registry
> (`plugins.entries`) and the tool resolver (`agents.defaults.memorySearch`).
> They are independent. The plugin can be enabled while the tool resolver is
> disabled, and the tools will silently not exist. Always set `enabled: true`
> in both locations.**
>
> **mcporter silently swallows package resolution failures.** If any server in
> `mcporter.json` has a bad command or package name, that server's tools vanish
> with no visible error. When tools go missing, check `mcporter.json` package
> names before anything else.
