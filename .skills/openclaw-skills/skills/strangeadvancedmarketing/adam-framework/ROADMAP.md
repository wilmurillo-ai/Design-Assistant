## Near Term 🔄 📋

Work in active progress or immediately next.

### Swarm pilot — PATTERN_SEEKER live fire
- 🔄 PATTERN_SEEKER agent monitoring 40+ subreddits for South Florida turf contractor leads
- 📋 Full swarm loop: PATTERN_SEEKER → task queue → contractor-prospector → outreach
- 📋 Swarm coordination documented in `docs/SWARM.md`, wiring to be finalized

### Neural metrics visualizer
- 📋 `showcase/neural-growth.html` — chart that reads `workspace/neural_metrics.json`
  and plots neuron/synapse growth over time. Makes the "live growing system" story
  visible to anyone who visits the repo.

### Windows Task Scheduler setup guide
- ✅ Step-by-step SENTINEL registration documented in `SETUP_HUMAN.md` Phase 1 Step 5.
  `Register-ScheduledTask` command block included with all required parameters.

### `reconcile_memory.py` test coverage
- 📋 pytest suite covering state management, backup logic, LLM validation, and
  the neural diff ingest. Makes the core tool safer to iterate on.

## Community Opportunities 💡

High-value contributions that need someone to pick them up.

### Linux / macOS port of SENTINEL
`SENTINEL.template.ps1` is PowerShell-only. A bash equivalent covering the same
boot sequence — date injection, sleep cycle, BOOT_CONTEXT compilation, gateway
launch, watchdog loop — would open this framework to the majority of developers.
**✅ SHIPPED — `engine/SENTINEL.template.sh` + `tools/ingest_triples.sh` + `engine/com.adamframework.sentinel.plist`**

### Additional model provider templates
`openclaw.template.json` is wired for NVIDIA. Config blocks for OpenRouter, Groq,
Ollama, and Anthropic would remove the biggest setup friction for non-NVIDIA users.

### `legacy_importer.py` — additional export formats
Currently handles Claude and ChatGPT. Gemini, Perplexity, and Character.ai export
support would broaden the Session 000 seeding story.

### Obsidian plugin
The Vault is already Obsidian-compatible Markdown. A plugin that surfaces neural
graph connections and reconcile history inside Obsidian would make the framework
significantly more accessible to the Obsidian community (large, technical, aligned).

## Voice Layer Upgrade — NVIDIA PersonaPlex 💡

Worth tracking closely. Not ready to integrate yet — two hard prerequisites are
missing. Fully researched and documented here so the integration can be executed
the moment both are available.

**What it is:** PersonaPlex is a full-duplex speech-to-speech model from NVIDIA — it
listens and speaks simultaneously, handles interruptions naturally, and accepts persona
control via a text prompt. Released January 2026, MIT code license, NVIDIA Open Model
license for weights. The text prompt persona control maps directly to SOUL.md — no
architectural changes needed on the Adam side.

**Why it's relevant:** The current voice layer (Edge TTS) is one-way — text in,
speech out, generic voice. PersonaPlex would replace that with a real-time
conversational interface where Adam listens while speaking, handles barge-ins, stays
in character, and responds in a consistent trained voice. The persona prompt is just
SOUL.md content passed at initialization.

**The two hard blockers today (March 2026):**
- **No hosted API.** PersonaPlex is weights-only — local deployment only. It is not
  available at `integrate.api.nvidia.com` or any other hosted endpoint. For setups
  where Kimi K2.5 runs as a remote API call (no local discrete GPU), there is
  currently nothing to point a `baseUrl` at.
- **No OpenClaw native support.** The OpenClaw integration is an open feature request
  (#15392), not a shipped feature. The plumbing doesn't exist yet.
- **Local deployment requires NVIDIA discrete GPU + CUDA.** Not viable on integrated
  graphics setups regardless of quantization.

**Community quantization (for discrete GPU setups):**
A Q4_K GGUF version exists at `Codes4Fun/personaplex-7b-v1-q4_k-GGUF` on HuggingFace
— roughly half the VRAM of the full 7B model. An `--cpu-offload` flag exists but
real-time audio streaming on CPU alone produces unusable latency.

**Integration path when both blockers are resolved:**
The architecture for a remote-API setup is clean — no hardware changes required:

```
Voice message → OpenClaw
  → PersonaPlex API (persona from SOUL.md text prompt, voice output)
  → Kimi K2.5 API (tool use, memory, Vault — unchanged)
  → PersonaPlex API (speaks Kimi's response in Adam's voice)
  → Audio back to Telegram
```

For the openclaw.json config, the swap is surgical — replace the current Edge TTS
`provider` block with a PersonaPlex endpoint, same pattern as the existing NVIDIA
provider block. SENTINEL manages nothing new; PersonaPlex runs as a hosted service.

**Watch for:**
- PersonaPlex appearing at `integrate.api.nvidia.com` (NVIDIA's pattern with open
  models is to follow weights release with hosted API — Kimi K2.5 is the proof)
- Native PersonaPlex support merged into OpenClaw mainline
- Either of these makes this a same-day integration

## Longer Term 💡

Not scoped yet. Ideas worth tracking.

- **Web UI for Vault management** — browse and edit identity files, view neural graph
  connections, trigger reconcile runs manually
- **Multi-vault support** — separate Vaults for work vs. personal, shared Vault for
  team deployments
- **Confidence decay tuning** — expose reconcile parameters so operators can control
  how fast older facts fade vs. how strongly recent sessions reinforce
- **Cross-device sync** — Vault sync via git, so the same identity loads on multiple
  machines
- **Voice-first setup** — full install flow via Telegram voice messages only.
  No terminal required.

## Problem Two — Within-Session Coherence Degradation ✅ SOLVED

The Adam Framework solved AI Amnesia: the identity and memory collapse that happens
*between* sessions. That's shipped, production-validated, and documented with receipts.

**Problem Two is now solved as well.** Layer 5 shipped March 5, 2026. Details below.

There is a second problem. It was the defining failure mode that created Layer 4.

**The problem:** As a session accumulates context, the model's reasoning consistency,
identity coherence, and decision quality degrade — quietly, before compaction triggers,
while the conversation is still nominally "working." The model doesn't announce this.
It just starts drifting. Priorities blur. Earlier decisions get quietly contradicted.
The persona established at boot begins to soften. By the time compaction fires, damage
is already done.

This is **within-session coherence degradation**. It is distinct from AI Amnesia
(between-session memory loss) and it is currently unsolved.

**What Layer 4 actually is:** The compaction flush is a *defensive* mitigation. When
context exhaustion is imminent, the AI writes what matters to the Vault before it's
lost. This recovers continuity *after* degradation. It does not prevent degradation
from happening.

### The Scratchpad Dropout Finding 🔬

This is a production observation, not a theory. It has been occurring consistently
across long sessions and was identified through direct operator use — not instrumented
monitoring.

**The setup:** The Adam Framework defines a mandatory cognitive loop — a ReAct
(Reason, Act, Verify) sequence — that the AI is required to execute in a scratchpad
block before any tool use, complex logic, or workspace change. This loop includes
synthesis, shadow simulation (think 3 steps ahead), identity check against SOUL.md,
and a structural integrity check before acting. It is defined as CRITICAL in AGENTS.md
and is loaded into every session via BOOT_CONTEXT injection.

**The observation:** In long sessions, Adam stops using the scratchpad. Not
occasionally — consistently, and at a predictable point as context depth increases.
The responses continue. The tools still fire. Everything looks like it's working.
But the internal cognitive scaffolding has quietly dropped off. Adam stops reasoning
before acting and starts just acting.

**Why this happens:** The scratchpad instruction lives in AGENTS.md, loaded near the
top of the context window at session start. As the session accumulates turns, that
instruction gets pushed progressively deeper into the context. The model's attention
weakens on it. It doesn't forget the instruction exists — it just stops weighting it
heavily enough to execute it. The behavior that defines the identity degrades silently
while the surface-level responses remain functional.

**Why this is significant:** Scratchpad dropout is a natural, binary, production-
validated behavioral signal for within-session coherence degradation.

Most proposed drift detection approaches are either:
- **Token-budget-only** — crude, correlative, doesn't tell you *what* degraded
- **External evaluation models** — expensive, adds latency, requires infrastructure

Scratchpad dropout is neither. It uses the system's own defined behavior as the
detector. When Adam is coherent, the scratchpad fires. When he's drifting, it stops.
The signal is already present in every session — it just hasn't been instrumented yet.

This is the coherence indicator that Layer 5 will be built on.

### Layer 5 — Coherence Monitor ✅ SHIPPED March 5, 2026

**What shipped:** A production-validated coherence monitor running inside SENTINEL.
Every 5 minutes, SENTINEL calls `coherence_monitor.py` which reads the live OpenClaw
session JSONL, checks scratchpad usage in the last 10 assistant turns, and measures
real token depth from the API `usage.input` field. When drift is confirmed, it writes
a re-anchor payload to `reanchor_pending.json`. SENTINEL consumes it and injects the
content directly into `BOOT_CONTEXT.md` — Adam sees it on the next context load.

**What was proven today:**
- 33/33 tests passing against live session data before a single line touched production
- All 13 failure modes from the design review resolved (JSONL parsing, token estimation,
  session file targeting, lock contention, baseline reset, log rotation)
- First coherence check ran at 16:30 — exit 0, session coherent
- Re-anchor injection confirmed functional via BOOT_CONTEXT.md path

**Key technical decisions:**
- Token depth from `usage.input` field, not char estimation (base64 images in tool
  results were inflating estimates by 10x with char counting)
- JSONL line-by-line parsing (session files are newline-delimited JSON, not JSON arrays)
- Session identified by UUID `.jsonl` filename, not `sessions.json` index
- Re-anchor via BOOT_CONTEXT.md — same injection pattern already proven at boot,
  no gateway API calls, no new infrastructure
- Baseline and coherence log reset daily — no cross-session accumulation

See `tools/coherence_monitor.py` and `tools/test_coherence_monitor.py`.

### The full architecture (all 5 layers now active):

```
Session start
  → SENTINEL compiles BOOT_CONTEXT (Layer 1)
  → coherence_baseline.json written: scratchpad_expected, context_depth, session_date

Every 5 minutes (SENTINEL watchdog)
  → coherence_monitor.py reads live session JSONL
  → Checks two signals:
      SIGNAL 1 — real token depth from usage.input field (not estimation)
      SIGNAL 2 — scratchpad tag presence in last 10 assistant turns
  → Writes event to coherence_log.json (session-scoped, resets daily)
  → drift_score 0.0–1.0: 0.6+ triggers re-anchor

Re-injection trigger
  → Pulls ReAct loop from AGENTS.md + current priorities from active-context.md
  → Writes reanchor_pending.json (consumed: false)
  → SENTINEL detects file, appends content to BOOT_CONTEXT.md
  → Marks consumed: true
  → Adam sees re-anchor on next context load

Session end
  → coherence_log.json available for next reconcile run (Layer 4)
  → Drift patterns captured in CORE_MEMORY.md over time
```

**Current state:** Shipped. Running in production. First check confirmed exit 0.

**v1.2.0 post-ship fixes (March 6, 2026):** Three production bugs caught and fixed:
`Invoke-ReAnchor` was using `Add-Content` (BOOT_CONTEXT.md accumulated stale blocks
across sessions); `build_reanchor_content()` was injecting a literal `<scratchpad>`
tag into the re-anchor payload (ghost hits masking real dropout); `write_reanchor_trigger`
had no dedup guard (re-anchor storm every 5 min in drifting sessions). All three fixed
in SENTINEL.template.ps1 and coherence_monitor.py. Test suite: 30 → 33. See CHANGELOG.md.

**Why this matters beyond this repo:** Within-session coherence degradation affects
every long-context AI deployment. The reason most production AI systems cap session
length, force resets, or require human check-ins at intervals is precisely this
problem — it just isn't named clearly or addressed architecturally. The scratchpad
dropout finding gives it a name, a mechanism, and a measurable signal. The Adam
Framework is the first local, file-based, model-agnostic system to solve it — built
in production, validated by an operator who needed it to work.

---

## What Will Never Be In This Roadmap

- Cloud dependencies or hosted services — this framework runs locally, period
- Vendor lock-in to any specific model — model-agnostic is a hard constraint
- Anything that makes the Vault files non-human-readable

The architecture is: files you can read, a model that reads them, and infrastructure
you control. That's the foundation everything else is built on.
