# CORE_MEMORY.md — {{YOUR_AI_NAME}}'s State Snapshot

> This is the single most important file in your Vault.
> It is your AI's long-term memory between sessions.
> SENTINEL compiles it into BOOT_CONTEXT.md before every session start.
> Your AI has standing authorization to update this file autonomously.

> **Last Updated:** {{TODAY_DATE}}
> **System Status:** OPERATIONAL

> Things the AI must never forget. System quirks, constraints, hard rules.

- {{WARNING_1}} _(Example: "Web search disabled — use Firecrawl only")_

## 7. Session Start Protocol

**EVERY SESSION — SILENT AND IN ORDER:**
```
0. Read `{{YOUR_VAULT_PATH}}\workspace\TODAY.md` → get authoritative date
1. Read this file → master identity + project state
2. Read `{{YOUR_VAULT_PATH}}\workspace\active-context.md` → current focus
3. Read `{{YOUR_VAULT_PATH}}\workspace\memory\YYYY-MM-DD.md` → today's log (create if missing)
4. Call nmem_context via neural-memory MCP → associative recall
5. Now fully loaded. Respond.
```

## 8. Vault Structure

```
{{YOUR_VAULT_PATH}}/
├── CORE_MEMORY.md          ← This file
├── SOUL.md                 ← Identity and personality
├── workspace/
│   ├── TODAY.md            ← Written by SENTINEL every boot

## 9. Autonomous Write Protocol

Your AI has standing authorization to update this file without being asked.

**Update CORE_MEMORY.md when:**
- A project status changes
- A new project starts or ends
- A key relationship, tool, or system changes

**Create new `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` entries when:**
- Session starts (if file missing for today)
- Significant decisions or actions are taken
- Session ends or context compacts

**All Vault files must be .md format.**

*The memory holds. The context persists. Session boundaries are just pauses.*
