# Council Self-Review

*The Council of the Wise analyzed itself. Here's what it found.*

---

## 👹 Devil's Advocate

**Key Insights:**
- The 2-5 minute runtime is friction — no guidance for when to choose this vs. asking directly
- Fallback to custom PAI agents is a hidden complexity bomb
- Token cost is invisible to users

**Recommendations:**
1. Add a "quick council" mode (30 seconds vs. 5 minutes)
2. Document failure handling — partial results better than silent failure
3. Explain *why* these four roles in the README

---

## 🏗️ Architect

**Key Insights:**
- Clean separation: orchestration (SKILL.md), personas (agents/), docs (README.md)
- Custom agent fallback is architecturally sound
- Sub-agent spawn is the right primitive

**Recommendations:**
1. Add `council.yaml` config for extensibility
2. Auto-discover agents in `agents/` folder
3. Define output schema formally

## 🛠️ Engineer

**Key Insights:**
- Implementation is lean — no over-engineering
- Path resolution logic is easy to test
- Sub-agent spawn is correct abstraction

**Recommendations:**
1. Add explicit timeout (5 min hard limit)
2. Validate agent files exist before spawning
3. Consider streaming partial output
4. Add skill test command

## 🎨 Artist

**Key Insights:**
- "Council of the Wise" naming is evocative and memorable
- Emoji-prefixed sections create visual hierarchy
- Invocation phrases feel conversational

**Recommendations:**
1. Give personas distinct *voices*, not just roles
2. Synthesis should call out where council disagreed
3. Write a killer README example
4. Consider "council transcript" mode with debate
