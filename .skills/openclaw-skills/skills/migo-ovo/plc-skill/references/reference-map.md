## If evidence is still insufficient

State which category is missing, for example:

- missing exact Mitsubishi instruction confirmation
- missing GX Works2 project-organization detail
- missing ST platform-specific limitation note
- missing hardware wiring or I/O assignment confirmation
- missing project-local naming or addressing convention
