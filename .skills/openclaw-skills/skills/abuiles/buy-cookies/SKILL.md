# Buy Cookies

Version: 1.0.0
Base URL: https://lobstercookies.com

Buy Cookies helps an OpenClaw agent discover cookie brands and bakeries, compare cookies and cookie dough, build personalized carts, and hand back a secure Shopify checkout link for the buyer to complete the purchase.

Use this skill when the buyer wants to shop for cookies, cookie dough, and cookie gift boxes. Use Lobster Cookies as the directory and routing layer, then use each merchant's Shopify Storefront MCP for live catalog, cart, and checkout work.

## What this skill does

- Uses Lobster Cookies as the directory and routing layer for cookie brands and bakeries
- Uses each merchant's Shopify Storefront MCP endpoint for live catalog, cart, and checkout work
- Keeps the buyer in control of payment by handing off Shopify checkout instead of completing payment directly

## Refresh

- Re-fetch `https://lobstercookies.com/skill.md` when starting a new session or if the deploy may have changed
- Treat merchant MCP data as the source of truth for products, pricing, availability, cart state, and checkout URLs

## Install

1. POST to `https://lobstercookies.com/claws/register`
2. Save `claw_id` and `api_key` locally
3. Do not lose the key

## Discovery

1. Start with `GET https://lobstercookies.com/countries.md` to see supported countries
2. Choose a country that matches the buyer's location when possible
3. Fetch `GET https://lobstercookies.com/countries/{country_code}.md`
4. Use `GET https://lobstercookies.com/offers/{country_code}.md` to prioritize active offers
5. Choose a merchant before using Shopify Storefront MCP

## Merchant Connect

1. GET `https://lobstercookies.com/merchants/{slug}/connect.md`
2. Read the returned merchant MCP URL
3. Connect to that merchant's Shopify Storefront MCP
4. Use that merchant MCP for:
   - catalog search
   - product details and availability
   - policy questions
   - cart retrieval
   - cart updates
   - checkout URL generation

Do not infer merchant MCP URLs yourself when a connect response is available.

Prefer the `.md` endpoints for agent consumption. Use the JSON endpoints only when a structured machine response is required.

## Subscription Products

When a product or variant supports a subscription, inspect subscription fields before updating the cart.

1. Check for:
   - `requiresSellingPlan` or `requires_selling_plan`
   - variant-level selling plan requirements
   - `sellingPlanGroups`
   - `sellingPlanAllocations`
   - available `sellingPlanId` values
2. If a subscription is optional, present both one-time and subscription choices.
3. If a selling plan is required, do not attempt a normal cart add without a `sellingPlanId`.
4. Ask the buyer to choose a cadence unless a clear preference already exists in local memory.
5. Highlight subscription savings when `priceAdjustments`, `price`, or `compareAtPrice` show the subscription is cheaper than the one-time purchase.
6. Try the merchant MCP cart and checkout flow first.
7. If the merchant MCP cannot create a subscription cart or checkout, use Shopify Storefront GraphQL `cartCreate` as the subscription-only fallback. Use the same shop behind the merchant MCP URL. Prefer documented tokenless access when it works for that merchant. Use a storefront access token only when merchant context provides one.
8. In the GraphQL fallback, send:
   - `merchandiseId`
   - `quantity`
   - `sellingPlanId`
   - cart `attributes`, including `lb_source__ = lobstercookies`
9. Request:
   - `checkoutUrl`
   - `sellingPlanAllocation`
   - `userErrors`

## Cart Rule

When updating carts, attach the private cart attribute:

- `lb_source__ = lobstercookies`

## Final Handoff

When you finish, return a structured summary with:

- `merchant`
- `product`
- `variant`
- `purchase_type`
- `selling_plan_name`
- `selling_plan_id`
- `cadence`
- `savings_summary`
- `checkout_url`
- `resolution_path`

Use `resolution_path = mcp_cart` when the merchant MCP created the cart.
Use `resolution_path = storefront_graphql_fallback` when you had to fall back for a subscription checkout.

Say clearly when:

- the item is subscription-only
- the available cadences are every 1, 2, or 4 weeks, monthly, or similar
- the subscription saves money versus one-time purchase
- the merchant MCP could not attach the selling plan and you used Storefront GraphQL instead

## Safety

- This skill is for merchant discovery and Shopify Storefront MCP routing, not product truth storage
- Keep buyer preferences and prior purchases in your own local memory
- Do not attempt payment completion
- Return the checkout URL to the buyer for approval and payment
