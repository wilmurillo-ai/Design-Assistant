# DeFi Security Audit: Aave

**Audit Date:** April 5, 2026
**Protocol:** Aave -- Multi-chain lending protocol

## Overview
- Protocol: Aave (V3)
- Chain: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, others
- Type: Lending / Borrowing
- TVL: ~$23.6B
- Launch Date: January 2020 (V1), March 2022 (V3)
- Source Code: Open (GitHub)

## Quick Triage Score: 92/100
- Red flags found: 0
- GoPlus token security: 0 HIGH / 1 MEDIUM flag (proxy contract only)

## Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Value | Benchmark (peers) | Rating |
|--------|-------|--------------------|--------|
| Insurance Fund / TVL | ~2% (Safety Module) | 1-5% | MEDIUM |
| Audit Coverage Score | 9+ (high recency) | 1-3 avg | LOW risk |
| Governance Decentralization | DAO + Guardian | Multisig avg | LOW risk |
| Timelock Duration | 24h / 168h | 24-48h avg | LOW risk |
| Multisig Threshold | 6/10 (Guardian) | 3/5 avg | LOW risk |
| GoPlus Risk Flags | 0 HIGH / 1 MED | -- | LOW risk |

## GoPlus Token Security (AAVE on Ethereum)

| Check | Result | Risk |
|-------|--------|------|
| Honeypot | No | -- |
| Open Source | Yes | -- |
| Proxy | Yes (upgradeable) | MEDIUM |
| Mintable | No | -- |
| Owner Can Change Balance | No | -- |
| Hidden Owner | No | -- |
| Selfdestruct | No | -- |
| Transfer Pausable | No | -- |
| Blacklist | No | -- |
| Slippage Modifiable | No | -- |
| Buy Tax / Sell Tax | 0% / 0% | -- |
| Holders | 193,226 | -- |
| Trust List | No | -- |
| Creator Honeypot History | No | -- |
| CEX Listed | Binance, Coinbase | -- |

GoPlus assessment: **LOW RISK**. The only flag is the proxy (upgradeable) pattern, which is expected -- upgrades are governed by the Aave DAO with dual timelocks (see Governance section). No honeypot, no hidden owner, no tax, no trading restrictions.

## Risk Summary

| Category | Risk Level | Key Concern | Verified? |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Governance & Admin | **LOW** | DAO governance + 6/10 Guardian + dual timelocks | Y |
| Oracle & Price Feeds | **LOW** | Chainlink primary with SVR fallback | Y |
| Economic Mechanism | **MEDIUM** | Robust liquidation; Umbrella upgrade in transition | Partial |
| Smart Contract | **LOW** | 6+ audit firms, formal verification, $1M bounty | Y |
| Token Contract (GoPlus) | **LOW** | Proxy only (DAO-governed); no honeypot, no hidden owner, no tax | Y |
| Operational Security | **LOW** | Doxxed founder, strong incident response history | Y |
| **Overall Risk** | **LOW** | **Gold standard for DeFi lending security** | |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Governance & Admin Key -- LOW

- Full on-chain DAO governance via AAVE token voting
- 6/10 community-elected Guardian multisig with limited powers (veto, pause, no drain capability)
- Two-tier timelock: 1 day (operational) / 7 days (governance-critical)
- Guardian can pause but cannot unilaterally upgrade or drain funds

### 2. Oracle & Price Feeds -- LOW

- Primary: Chainlink price feeds across all deployments
- SVR (Smart Value Recapture) integration adds dual-aggregator fallback
- Governance can change oracle sources but subject to timelock
- No known oracle manipulation exploit in production

### 3. Economic Mechanism -- MEDIUM

- Standard health-factor liquidation with flash loan support
- Safety Module: stkAAVE/stkABPT (slashing currently disabled during Umbrella transition)
- Umbrella: New per-asset automated staking system with automatic slashing
- Recovery issuance: Emergency AAVE minting as dilutive backstop
- Small bad debt events from market volatility (~$1.6M CRV, Nov 2022) -- not contract bugs

### 4. Smart Contract Security -- LOW

- Audit firms: Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Certora (formal verification), ChainSecurity, CertiK, MixBytes, PeckShield, ConsenSys Diligence
- Certora formal verification integrated from V3 design stage
- Bug bounty: Up to $1M via Immunefi
- V4: $1.5M dedicated audit budget
- Upgradeable via proxy, but governed by DAO + timelock

### 5. Operational Security -- LOW

- Founder Stani Kulechov is fully doxxed (Finnish entrepreneur)
- Aave Labs and BGD Labs are known entities
- Nov 2023: Critical V2 vulnerability patched via bug bounty before exploitation
- No user fund losses from smart contract exploits across 6+ years

## Historical DeFi Hack Pattern Check

### Drift-type (Governance + Oracle + Social Engineering):
- [ ] Admin can list new collateral without timelock -- **NO**, requires governance + timelock
- [ ] Admin can change oracle sources arbitrarily -- **NO**, subject to timelock
- [ ] Admin can modify withdrawal limits -- **NO**, liquidity-based only
- [ ] Multisig has low threshold -- **NO**, 6/10
- [ ] Zero or short timelock -- **NO**, 1d minimum, 7d for critical
- [ ] Pre-signed transaction risk -- **N/A**, EVM-based
- [ ] Social engineering surface area -- **LOW**, doxxed team + high threshold

**0/7 flags matched.**

### Euler/Mango-type:
- [ ] Low-liquidity collateral accepted -- **NO**, strict listing criteria
- [ ] Single oracle source without TWAP -- Chainlink only, but robust
- [ ] No circuit breaker -- Has pause capability via Guardian
- [ ] Insufficient insurance -- Safety Module transitioning to Umbrella

**0-1/4 flags matched.** Minor concern around insurance transition period.

## Peer Comparison

| Feature | Aave | Compound | MakerDAO |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| Timelock | 1d / 7d | 2d | 2d (GSM) |
| Multisig | 6/10 Guardian | Community multisig | Recognized delegates |
| Audits | 9+ firms | 5+ firms | 5+ firms |
| Oracle | Chainlink + SVR | Chainlink | Chainlink + Chronicle |
| Open Source | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Recommendations

- Monitor the Safety Module to Umbrella transition -- temporary gap in slashing capability
- Single oracle provider dependency (Chainlink) is an industry-wide risk, not Aave-specific
- No immediate action needed for users
