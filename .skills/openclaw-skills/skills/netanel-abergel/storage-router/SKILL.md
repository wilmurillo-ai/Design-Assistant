# Storage Router

Before saving anything, route it to the correct destination.

---

## Decision Table

| Content Type | Destination | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor research | monday.com — Competitive Analysis doc | your monday.com workspace |
| Product briefs, strategy docs | monday.com — relevant doc | your monday.com workspace |
| Meeting notes | monday.com — Notetaker / item update | |
| Project tasks / tracking | monday.com — board item | |
| PA rules & preferences | MEMORY.md | Long-term only, distilled |
| Lessons learned | MEMORY.md | After 2+ repetitions |
| Daily event log | memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md | Raw log, not curated |
| WhatsApp conversation context | memory/whatsapp/groups/ or dms/ | Per-conversation, local |
| Cron state / job state | local JSON (data/ or inbox/) | Runtime state only |
| PA contact list | PA_LIST.md (local) | Source of truth for PA sync |
| Config / credentials | local only, never monday | Security |
| Skill files | workspace/skills/ | Never monday |

---

## Persistent Layer Decision

| Layer | Best for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub** (private repo) | Agent state, memory, skills, .context | Version history, automated backup, private |
| **monday.com** | Research, docs, tasks, strategy | Searchable, shareable, owner-accessible |
| **Local only** | Runtime state, credentials, cron state | Speed, security, no sync needed |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Owner needs to read/share it → monday.com
- Agent needs it across sessions → GitHub
- Ephemeral or secret → local only

---

## Rules

### ALWAYS → monday.com
- Research (competitors, market, technology)
- Documents the owner needs to access or share
- Project tracking, tasks, milestones
- Meeting summaries
- GTM, product, strategy content

### ALWAYS → GitHub (private repo)
- MEMORY.md, daily notes, .context files
- Skill files (SKILL.md → pa-skills public repo)
- Agent behavioral rules and preferences
- Lessons learned

### ALWAYS → local only
- Runtime state (cron jobs, inbox, heartbeat state)
- WhatsApp memory (per-conversation context)
- Credentials and config
- PA directory (PA_LIST.md)

### NEVER
- ❌ Save research/docs to local files only
- ❌ Save credentials or config to monday.com
- ❌ Save WhatsApp context to monday.com
- ❌ Duplicate content across layers

---

## Local Context

Load agent-specific IDs from `.context` file in this skill's directory:
```bash
CONTEXT_FILE="/opt/ocana/openclaw/workspace/skills/storage-router/.context"
[ -f "$CONTEXT_FILE" ] && source "$CONTEXT_FILE"
# Then use: $WORKSPACE_ID, $FOLDER_RESEARCH, $DOC_COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS, etc.
```
If `.context` doesn't exist — use Structure Index doc (DOC_STRUCTURE_INDEX) from monday.com to find current IDs.

## How to Use

Before saving any file or content, ask:

1. **Will Netanel need to access or share this?** → monday.com
2. **Is this runtime/operational state?** → local
3. **Is this a rule or preference I've confirmed multiple times?** → MEMORY.md
4. **Is this a daily event log?** → memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md

When in doubt → monday.com for content, local for state.
