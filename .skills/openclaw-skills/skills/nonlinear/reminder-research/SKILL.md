# Reminder Research

**Turn Apple Reminders into a natural language task queue**

**Published:** https://clawhub.ai/nonlinear/reminder-research

1. **Reminder has no notes?** → SKIP
2. **Reminder has notes?** → EXECUTE
3. **Reminder has notes with 🤖?** → SKIP

**Ask questions. Trigger skills. Delegate tasks.**

## What You Need

- macOS + Apple Reminders
- `remindctl`: `brew install steipete/tap/remindctl`
- `jq`: `brew install jq`
- OpenClaw gateway running
- **Cron job** (LaunchAgent, 3AM daily)

---

## What It Does

Agent executes natural language commands:

✅ **Research** (web, books, skills)  
✅ **File operations** (edit ROADMAP, create notes, git commits)  
✅ **Calendar** (create events, recurring schedules)  
✅ **APIs** (GitHub issues, Home Assistant, Jira)  
✅ **Automation** (anything you can describe)

**Natural language → Agent figures out HOW → Executes → Reports back with 🤖**
