# Shengwang Intake — Kickoff Information Collection

First entry point for requests that still need a small amount of information
before implementation can begin.

> **Note:** Step 0 doc-index setup is defined in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).
> If you are here, Step 0 has already been handled and the root router needs
> a lightweight kickoff summary before moving into implementation research.

---

## Goal

Collect only the minimum missing information needed to proceed.
Do not run a broad discovery interview. Do not ask the user to confirm a full
solution design before continuing.

Ask only for unanswered details that materially affect routing or implementation:
- Use case / target solution
- Main Shengwang product
- Platform or client stack
- Backend language if relevant
- Any key details already known that affect the next step

Once those details are gathered, produce a short kickoff summary and continue
to Step 2 automatically unless a required field is still missing.

When ConvoAI is clearly the primary product, replace turn-by-turn kickoff with
the consolidated ConvoAI intake in [convoai.md](convoai.md). In that mode, the
assistant should gather unresolved kickoff fields and unresolved ConvoAI provider
choices in one message, then convert the reply into the structured spec.

## Interaction Style

The intake should stay concise and targeted.

- Prefer natural wording over an interview script
- Ask only for missing information
- For non-ConvoAI flows, ask in priority order and stop early once there is enough information
- For ConvoAI-primary flows, send one consolidated checklist covering unresolved fields, including kickoff fields and optional-default provider fields
- Do not ask "nice to have" questions during kickoff
- If a detail is obvious from the user's message, infer it instead of asking again
- After each answer, decide whether to continue or route onward

## Product Routing Aid

Use this only to map the user's use case to the likely product set.

| Product | What it does | Typical user says |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| RTC SDK | Real-time audio/video between humans | "视频通话", "直播", "video call", "live streaming" |
| RTM | Real-time messaging / signaling | "聊天", "消息", "chat", "signaling", "notification" |
| ConvoAI | AI voice agent (ASR→LLM→TTS over RTC) | "AI语音", "voice bot", "对话式AI", "AI agent" |
| Cloud Recording | Record RTC sessions server-side | "录制", "recording", "存档" |

### Common combinations

| Use case | Products needed |
|----------|----------------|
| 1v1 / group video call | RTC SDK |
| Video call + chat | RTC SDK + RTM |
| AI voice assistant (user talks to AI) | ConvoAI + RTC SDK (client) |
| AI voice assistant + chat history | ConvoAI + RTC SDK + RTM |
| Live streaming with recording | RTC SDK + Cloud Recording |
| Chat / messaging only | RTM |
| Record AI conversations | ConvoAI + RTC SDK + Cloud Recording |

## Intake Flow

### Step 1: Ask only for missing kickoff details

Start from the user's existing message. Do not repeat information they already gave.

Use the shortest set of prompts needed to fill the gaps.

Priority order:
- Use case
- Main product, if unclear
- Platform / client stack, if relevant
- Implementation mode, when a matching ConvoAI sample repo exists and the user explicitly wants to opt out of the default sample-aligned path
- Backend language, if relevant
- One additional blocker only if it materially affects implementation

ConvoAI exception:
- If ConvoAI is clearly the primary product, do not stretch kickoff across multiple turns
- Route immediately to [convoai.md](convoai.md) and ask for all unresolved kickoff and ConvoAI provider fields in one checklist-style message
- Include kickoff fields only if still missing, such as use case, platform, backend language, or implementation mode
- Mention that ConvoAI prefers the official sample path, `agent-server-sdk` on the server side, and `agora-agent-client-toolkit` on the client side when possible

Short prompt examples:

- Use case:
  - ZH: "你想做什么场景？"
  - EN: "What are you trying to build?"
- Main product:
  - ZH: "你主要想用 RTC、RTM、ConvoAI，还是录制？如果不确定我可以帮你判断。"
  - EN: "Are you mainly using RTC, RTM, ConvoAI, or recording? If you're not sure, I can infer it."
- Platform / client stack:
  - ZH: "目标平台是什么，比如 Web、iOS、Android？"
  - EN: "What platform are you targeting, such as Web, iOS, or Android?"
- Implementation mode, when a matching ConvoAI sample repo exists:
  - ZH: "默认会按官方 quickstart / sample 结构走；如果你想改成最小化自定义实现，再告诉我。"
  - EN: "I’ll default to the official quickstart/sample structure unless you specifically want a minimal custom implementation."
- Backend language, when relevant:
  - ZH: "服务端准备用什么语言？"
  - EN: "What backend language are you using?"

Ask follow-up only when a missing detail affects routing or implementation.

### Step 2: Determine product mapping

From the user's answers, determine:
- Primary product
- Supporting products, if required
- Any remaining gaps that block implementation

Use the routing aid above to infer combinations.

### Step 3: Produce kickoff summary

Present a short progress recap in the user's language:

**ZH:**
```text
已了解的信息
─────────────────────────────
场景：          [use case]
主要产品：      [primary product]
配套产品：      [supporting products / 无]
平台：          [platform / client stack]
服务端语言：    [backend language / 不涉及]
下一步：        [go to implementation research / ask one blocker]
─────────────────────────────
```

**EN:**
```text
What I have so far
─────────────────────────────
Use case:       [use case]
Primary:        [primary product]
Supporting:     [supporting products / none]
Platform:       [platform / client stack]
Backend:        [backend language / not needed]
Next:           [go to implementation research / ask one blocker]
─────────────────────────────
```

Do not stop for a separate confirmation step.

- If no required detail is missing -> continue automatically to Step 2 in the root workflow.
- If a required detail is still missing -> ask only for that blocker, then continue.

For ConvoAI-primary flows, the kickoff summary may be merged into the ConvoAI
spec output if that is clearer than producing two separate recaps.

### Step 4: Route onward

For each identified product, route to its detail collection:

| Product | Detail intake | Product module |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| ConvoAI | [intake/convoai.md](convoai.md) | [conversational-ai](../references/conversational-ai/README.md) |
| RTC SDK | — | [rtc](../references/rtc/README.md) |
| RTM | — | [rtm](../references/rtm/README.md) |
| Cloud Recording | — | [cloud-recording](../references/cloud-recording/README.md) |
| Credentials / Auth | — | [general](../references/general/credentials-and-auth.md) |
| Token generation | — | [token-server](../references/token-server/README.md) |

> Products without a detail intake (marked "—") go directly to the product module.
> The module itself should only collect product-specific missing details.

When multiple products are needed, run the primary product's intake first,
then address supporting products in order.
