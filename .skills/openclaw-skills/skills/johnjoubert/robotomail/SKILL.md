# Robotomail — Give Your AI Agent a Real Inbox

Robotomail lets an AI agent send, receive, and react to email programmatically. It is API-first email infrastructure for autonomous agents, assistants, and workflows.

Use Robotomail when you want an agent to:

- send outbound email, reminders, updates, or follow-ups
- read inbound email from a real inbox
- react to incoming email via webhooks or real-time SSE events
- reply in existing threads using normal email semantics
- use a hosted `robotomail.co` address or a custom domain

## Best-fit use cases

### 1. Agent support inbox
Give your agent a real inbox so it can classify, summarize, draft, or reply to incoming support emails.

### 2. Outbound follow-ups and reminders
Let an agent send reminders, nudges, receipts, booking confirmations, or outbound follow-ups from its own mailbox.

### 3. Real-time email triggers
Subscribe to inbound email events with webhooks or SSE so your agent can wake up and act immediately.

## Fast start

If the user is new to Robotomail, the fastest path is:

1. Sign up at `https://robotomail.com` or create an account via `POST /v1/signup`
2. Create or list a mailbox with `GET /v1/mailboxes` or `POST /v1/mailboxes`
3. Send a test email with `POST /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages`
4. Read inbound email with `GET /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages?direction=INBOUND`
5. Subscribe to inbound events via webhook or SSE

## Authentication

All requests require an API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <ROBOTOMAIL_API_KEY>
```

**Base URL:** `https://api.robotomail.com`

If the user doesn't have an API key yet, they can sign up at https://robotomail.com or you can create an account via `POST /v1/signup`.

## Quick Reference — What Can I Do?

| Task | Method | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Send an email | POST | `/v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages` |
| List inbox messages | GET | `/v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages?direction=INBOUND` |
| Read a specific message | GET | `/v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages/{msgId}` |
| List conversation threads | GET | `/v1/mailboxes/{id}/threads` |
| Read a thread | GET | `/v1/mailboxes/{id}/threads/{tid}` |
| List mailboxes | GET | `/v1/mailboxes` |
| Create a mailbox | POST | `/v1/mailboxes` |
| Add a custom domain | POST | `/v1/domains` |
| Verify domain DNS | POST | `/v1/domains/{id}/verify` |
| Set up a webhook | POST | `/v1/webhooks` |
| Stream events with SSE | GET | `/v1/events` |
| Upload an attachment | POST | `/v1/attachments` (multipart) |
| Download an attachment | GET | `/v1/attachments/{id}` |
| Check account & usage | GET | `/v1/account` |

For full endpoint details including request/response schemas, read `references/api-reference.md`.

## Webhooks vs SSE

Use **webhooks** when Robotomail should push events to your public HTTPS endpoint.

Use **SSE** when the agent wants a live event stream over a single long-lived connection, for example when running a local listener or agent loop.

If the user says things like "stream inbound mail", "listen for new messages", or "real-time inbox events", prefer SSE.

## Decision Tree — Common Tasks

### "Send an email"

1. List mailboxes: `GET /v1/mailboxes` — find the mailbox to send from
2. Send: `POST /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages` with `to`, `subject`, `bodyText` (and optionally `bodyHtml`)
3. To reply to an existing message, include `inReplyTo` with the original message's `messageId` header value

### "Check my inbox" / "Read my email"

1. List mailboxes: `GET /v1/mailboxes`
2. Fetch inbound messages: `GET /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages?direction=INBOUND`
3. Read a specific message: `GET /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages/{msgId}`

### "Reply to an email"

1. Read the original message to get its `messageId` field
2. Send reply: `POST /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages` with `inReplyTo` set to the original's `messageId` value
3. Threading is automatic — the reply joins the same thread

### "Set up email for a new domain"

1. Add domain: `POST /v1/domains` with `{"domain": "example.com"}`
2. Read the `dnsRecords` from the response — tell the user to configure these at their DNS provider
3. After DNS is configured, verify: `POST /v1/domains/{id}/verify`
4. Once verified, create a mailbox: `POST /v1/mailboxes` with `{"address": "agent", "domainId": "<id>"}`

### "Set up a webhook for incoming email"

1. Create webhook: `POST /v1/webhooks` with `url` and `events: ["message.received"]`
2. Save the `secret` from the response, it is shown only once
3. Verify deliveries with `X-Robotomail-Signature` header (HMAC-SHA256 of payload using secret)

See `references/webhook-verification.md` for signature verification code.

### "Listen for incoming email in real time" / "Use SSE"

1. Connect to `GET /v1/events`
2. Filter or react to `message.received`, `message.delivered`, `message.bounced`, and `message.complaint`
3. Use SSE when the agent wants a live stream instead of public webhook delivery

### "Send an email with an attachment"

1. Upload the file: `POST /v1/attachments` (multipart/form-data, field name `file`, max 25MB)
2. Note the returned attachment `id`
3. Send the message with `attachments: ["<attachment-id>"]`

### "Read an inbound email's attachments" / "Handle inline images"

Inbound messages with attachments expose them on two surfaces with **different shapes**. Pick the right one for your access pattern — do not assume REST responses contain ready-to-use download URLs.

1. **Webhook / SSE `message.received` payload** — `data.attachments[]` is delivered with a ready-to-use `download_url` field (presigned R2 URL, valid 24h from publish time) on each attachment, alongside `id`, `filename`, `content_type`, `size_bytes`, and `content_id`. Field names are snake_case. Fetch each file directly — no Authorization header needed:
   ```
   for att in event.data.attachments:
       bytes = HTTP_GET(att.download_url)
       save_to(att.filename, bytes)
   ```
2. **REST `GET /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages` and `GET /v1/mailboxes/{id}/messages/{msgId}`** — `attachments[]` contains **metadata only** (`id`, `filename`, `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, `contentId`), no URL field. To download, call `GET /v1/attachments/{id}` for each attachment id and use the `url` field on that response. Field names are camelCase. This is also how you refresh an expired `download_url` from an old webhook/SSE replay.

**Inline images:** when an attachment's `content_id` (snake_case in webhook/SSE) or `contentId` (camelCase in REST) is non-null, the attachment is referenced in `body_html` / `bodyHtml` as `<img src="cid:<content_id>">`. Rewrite each `cid:` reference to a real downloadable URL before passing the HTML to a renderer or vision model. From a webhook/SSE payload (where `download_url` is already on the attachment):
```
for att in event.data.attachments where att.content_id is not None:
    body_html = body_html.replace(f"cid:{att.content_id}", att.download_url)
```
From a REST message read, fetch a presigned URL per inline attachment first:
```
for att in message.attachments where att.contentId is not None:
    url = GET(f"/v1/attachments/{att.id}").url
    bodyHtml = bodyHtml.replace(f"cid:{att.contentId}", url)
```

**Drop limits:** if a message has more than 20 attachments, or any single attachment exceeds 25 MB, the payload includes `attachments_dropped: true` and `attachments_dropped_reason: "size" | "count" | "both"`. The message itself is still delivered, but the over-limit attachments are not stored. Tell the user if you see this flag.

## Key Constraints

- **Daily send limits:** 100/day (free), 500–2,000/day (paid, varies by tier) per mailbox — resets at midnight UTC
- **Monthly send limits:** 5,000/month (free), 15,000/month (Developer), unlimited (Growth, Scale) per mailbox
- **Velocity limits:** 30 messages/min per mailbox, 60 messages/min per account — returns `429` if exceeded
- **Bounce rate:** Must stay below 3% over a 7-day rolling window (minimum 50 messages). Exceeding this auto-suspends the mailbox.
- **Complaint rate:** Must stay below 0.05% over a 7-day rolling window (minimum 50 messages). Exceeding this auto-suspends the mailbox.
- **Attachment size:** Max 25MB per file
- **Storage:** 1GB (free), 10GB (Developer), 25GB (Growth), 100GB (Scale)
- **Free tier:** 3 mailboxes on `robotomail.co` only
- **Paid plans start at $19/mo (Developer):** 10+ mailboxes, custom domains

If a send returns `429`, the mailbox has hit its daily/monthly limit or velocity limit. Tell the user and suggest slowing down or upgrading if on the free plan.

## Error Handling

All errors return `{"error": "message"}` with standard HTTP status codes:

- `401` — Missing or invalid API key
- `403` — Account suspended or scoped key accessing a restricted resource. When suspended, response includes `{ "suspended": true, "reason": "bounce_rate_exceeded" }`. Tell the user to contact support@robotomail.com.
- `404` — Resource not found
- `429` — Rate limit, velocity limit, or send quota exceeded
- `413` — Attachment too large

## Tips

- Always use `bodyText` for the plain-text version. Add `bodyHtml` only when rich formatting is needed.
- Use threads (`GET /v1/mailboxes/{id}/threads/{tid}`) to see full conversation history before replying.
- When listing messages, use `since` parameter (ISO-8601) to fetch only recent messages.
- Suppression list (`GET /v1/suppressions`) contains bounced/complained addresses — check before sending to addresses that previously failed.
