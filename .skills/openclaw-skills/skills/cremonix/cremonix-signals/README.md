# Cremonix Trading Signals

Live BTC/ETH regime intelligence from a production trading system. Not backtested theory. Not a demo. This is the same ML ensemble that executes real trades for Cremonix clients, now available as a free intelligence feed.

## What it does

Tells you the current market regime for BTC and ETH, and whether any high-probability setup has passed all constraint filters. Four regimes, two timeframes (1h and 4h), structured JSON output.

Most trading tools tell you what happened. This one tells you whether you should be trading at all right now.

## Installation

```bash
clawhub install cremonix-signals
```

Or with the OpenClaw CLI:

```bash
openclaw install Cremonix/cremonix-regime-intelligence
```

## Quick start

No account, no API key, no setup. Just fetch:

```bash
curl -s "https://blog.cremonix.com/feeds/cremonix-free.json"
```

Ask your agent:

- "What regime is BTC in right now?"
- "Should I be trading or sitting out?"
- "Are there any setups that passed all filters?"

## What you get

- Market regime for BTC and ETH (1h + 4h timeframes)
- Setup detection when ML models trigger and pass constraint filters
- Updated every 5 minutes with a 4-hour delay
- Structured JSON, no parsing ambiguity

## Regimes

- Trend_Up: Strong uptrend. Best conditions for entries.
- Trend_Down: Downtrend. Most models blocked.
- Chop_Mean_Reversion: Range-bound. Sit-out conditions for most strategies.
- Panic_High_Vol: Extreme volatility. High conviction required.
