# consensus-send-email-guard

Pre-send governance for outbound email automation.

`consensus-send-email-guard` evaluates an email draft before delivery and returns:

- `APPROVE`
- `BLOCK`
- `REWRITE`

with structured rationale and board-native audit artifacts.

## Typical use cases

- customer-facing lifecycle emails
- sales/prospecting automation
- sensitive account or policy notifications
- high-trust operational communications

## What it evaluates

- policy and tone compliance
- risky guarantees or commitments
- confidentiality and sensitive data concerns
- rewrite quality for fixable drafts

## Core capabilities

- strict schema validation
- deterministic persona-weighted voting
- idempotent retry behavior
- `rewrite_patch` generation path for actionable edits
- board-native decision + persona update artifacts

## Output highlights

- decision metadata (`decision_id`, `timestamp`)
- vote + aggregation breakdown
- `final_decision`
- optional `rewrite_patch`
- `board_writes[]`

## Environment + state path

This package reads state-path configuration from:
- `CONSENSUS_STATE_FILE`
- `CONSENSUS_STATE_ROOT`

Use a dedicated non-privileged directory for state; do not point state paths at system or secrets directories.
