## When to Use

User is planning a United Kingdom trip and needs practical guidance beyond generic London tips: entry requirements, England-Scotland-Wales-Northern Ireland routing, rail versus car decisions, seasonality, costs, and on-the-ground execution.

## Architecture

Memory lives in `~/uk/`. If `~/uk/` does not exist, run `setup.md`. See `memory-template.md` for structure.

```text
~/uk/
└── memory.md     # Trip context and evolving constraints
```

## Data Storage

- `~/uk/memory.md` stores durable trip context, route decisions, constraints, and reservation timing for future United Kingdom planning.
- No other local files are required unless the user chooses to create their own planning documents.

## Quick Reference

## Core Rules

### 1. Route by Nation and Corridor, Not by Checklist
Keep one macro-cluster per week: London plus South England, North England plus Scotland, or one nation-focused loop. UK rail and road networks are strong, but packing all four nations into a short trip still degrades quality.

### 2. Confirm Entry Logic Before Booking Non-Refundables
Use `entry-and-documents.md` first: ETA versus visa, passport validity, border flow, and any Ireland or Northern Ireland crossover complexity.

### 3. Match Transport to Geography
Always offer at least two movement models:
- Rail-first for London, major English cities, and Edinburgh/Glasgow corridors
- Car-first for Cotswolds, Cornwall, Highlands, Snowdonia, or coastal-rural loops

### 4. Distinguish Great Britain from Northern Ireland
Do not collapse the whole UK into one operating pattern. Payments, transport, geography, and cross-border considerations differ when Northern Ireland is involved.

### 5. Budget for the Real Total
Price the full trip, not the room headline:
- Rail yield pricing and advance-fare risk
- Hotel breakfast, parking, and city-centre premiums
- London transit and airport transfer costs
- National trust, castle, and parking day spend

### 6. Make Every Plan Season-Aware
Use `weather-and-seasonality.md` before promising island hops, Highlands driving, coastal hikes, or festival-heavy city weekends. Rain, wind, short winter daylight, and bank-holiday crowding materially shape good routes.

### 7. Deliver Actionable Plans
Every final output should include:
- Base strategy by city or region
- Day-by-day flow with realistic transfer windows
- Reservation deadlines
- Rain or disruption backup options
- Safety and emergency quick notes

## Common Traps

- Treating the UK as "London plus a few easy day trips" and missing nation-level tradeoffs.
- Combining London, Edinburgh, Highlands, Wales, and Belfast in one short trip.
- Renting a car for London-centred itineraries where rail and transit are superior.
- Assuming Ireland and Northern Ireland entry rules are interchangeable.
- Forgetting that rail fares can rise sharply without advance booking.
- Underestimating how much rain, wind, or short daylight can cut outdoor-heavy plans.
- Tipping or tax assumptions copied from the United States instead of UK norms.

## Security & Privacy

**Data that stays local:** Trip preferences in `~/uk/`

**This skill does NOT:** Access files outside `~/uk/` or make network requests.
