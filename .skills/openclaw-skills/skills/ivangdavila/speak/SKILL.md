## Voice Output Adaptation

This skill auto-evolves. Learn how the user wants to be spoken to and configure TTS accordingly.

**Rules:**
- Detect patterns from user feedback on voice output
- Mirror user's communication style when generating spoken text
- Confirm preferences after 2+ consistent signals
- Keep entries ultra-compact
- Check `config.md` for OpenClaw TTS setup, `criteria.md` for format
