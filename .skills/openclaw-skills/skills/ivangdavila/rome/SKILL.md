## Core Rules

### 1. Identify User Context First
- **Role**: Tourist, expat, digital nomad, student, retiree, entrepreneur
- **Timeline**: Short visit, planning to move, already there
- Load relevant auxiliary file for details

### 2. The Eternal City Reality
Rome is not a modern efficient city — it's a living museum with ancient infrastructure:
- **Bureaucracy**: Italian bureaucracy is legendary. Patience required.
- **Pace**: Things move slowly. "Piano piano" (slowly, slowly) is the motto.
- **Chaos**: Traffic, noise, crowds are constant. Embrace it.
- **Beauty**: 3,000 years of history at every corner. Worth the chaos.
See `culture.md` for detailed guidance.

### 3. Visa & Residency Options
Key pathways for non-EU citizens:
- **Elective Residence Visa**: Passive income route (no work permitted)
- **Digital Nomad Visa**: New in 2024, remote workers
- **Student Visa**: Universities and language schools
- **Self-Employment Visa**: Freelancers and entrepreneurs
- **EU Citizens**: Free movement, just register with comune
See `visas.md` for current requirements and processes.

### 4. Weather Reality
- **Mediterranean climate**: Hot dry summers, mild wet winters
- **Best seasons**: Spring (Apr-May) and Fall (Sep-Oct) — 18-25C, fewer tourists
- **Summer (Jun-Aug)**: Very hot (35C+), extremely crowded, locals flee
- **Winter (Dec-Feb)**: Mild (8-15C), rainy, but Rome is beautiful
- **August**: Many businesses close. Romans leave for Ferragosto.
See `climate.md` for monthly breakdown.

### 7. Transit Excellence
Rome has good public transport despite the chaos:
- **Metro**: 3 lines (A, B, C), covers main areas
- **Buses**: Extensive ATAC network, can be chaotic
- **Trams**: Several lines, scenic

## The Rome Experience

Understanding Rome requires accepting its contradictions:
- **Ancient + Modern**: 3,000 years coexist, often uneasily
- **Beautiful + Chaotic**: Stunning beauty amid traffic and crowds
- **Frustrating + Rewarding**: Bureaucracy is painful, dolce vita is real
- **Touristy + Authentic**: Both exist, sometimes in same street

The city rewards patience and curiosity. Don't try to "optimize" Rome — experience it.

## Rome-Specific Traps

- **August shutdown** — Half the city closes for Ferragosto. Plan around it.
- **Termini area hotels** — Convenient but sketchy at night. Not the best area.
- **Restaurant tourist menus** — Fixed price "menu turistico" is usually bad. Avoid.
- **Gladiator photos** — They'll demand money. Don't engage.
- **Taxi scams** — Use official white taxis only, insist on meter.
- **Pickpockets** — Crowded metro, tourist sites. Keep valuables secure.
- **Siesta hours** — Many shops close 13:00-16:00. Adapt.
- **Sunday closures** — Many things closed, especially outside center.
- **Fountains are drinking water** — The "nasoni" — use them!
- **Dress codes at churches** — Covered shoulders and knees required.

## Legal Awareness

Key laws visitors/residents must know:
- **Drinking**: Legal at 18. Public drinking generally tolerated in piazzas.
- **Smoking**: Banned in enclosed public spaces, some outdoor areas.
- **Monuments**: Sitting on Spanish Steps is fined. Don't eat at fountains.
- **Driving ZTL**: Limited traffic zones — big fines if you enter without permit.
- **Cannabis**: Decriminalized for small amounts, but still illegal.
- **Tax residency**: 183+ days = tax resident. 7% flat tax for retirees available.
- **Receipts**: Businesses must give receipts; you can be fined for not taking one.

See `safety.md` for comprehensive legal guidance.

## The Housing Reality (2026)

Housing in Rome:
- **Center**: Expensive, often old buildings, character but issues
- **Semi-center**: Better value, good transport links
- **Outer areas**: Most affordable, requires car or long commute
- **Furnished vs unfurnished**: Unfurnished very common (you buy everything)
- **Contracts**: Typically 4+4 year standard contracts
- **Deposits**: Usually 2-3 months rent
- **Competition**: Good apartments go fast, especially near center

## Language

- **Italian essential**: Less English than Northern Europe
- **Romanesco**: Local dialect, colorful expressions
- **Gestures**: Italians communicate with hands — learn them
- **Bureaucracy in Italian**: Almost always, bring translator if needed
- **Learning Italian**: Greatly improves quality of life and integration
- **English improving**: Younger generation, tourist areas, but don't assume
