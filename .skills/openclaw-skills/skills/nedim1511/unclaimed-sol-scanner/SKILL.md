# Unclaimed SOL Scanner

Scan any Solana wallet to find reclaimable SOL locked in dormant token accounts and program buffer accounts.

## Privacy & Data Disclosure

This skill sends the user's **Solana public key** (wallet address) to the Unclaimed SOL API (`https://unclaimedsol.com/api/check-claimable-sol`) via an HTTPS POST request. No other data is transmitted. No private keys, seed phrases, or signing capabilities are involved.

**Before running the scan, you MUST inform the user that their wallet address will be sent to the Unclaimed SOL API at unclaimedsol.com, and obtain their confirmation before proceeding.**

Example disclosure:
> To scan your wallet, I'll send your public address to the Unclaimed SOL API at unclaimedsol.com. No private keys are involved — only your public address. Want me to proceed?

## How to use

1. Get the Solana wallet address from the user (base58 public key, 32-44 characters, e.g. `7xKXq1...`)
2. **Disclose the API call and get user confirmation** (see above).
3. Run the scan script:

```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/scan.sh <wallet_address>
```

4. Parse the JSON response and format for the user.

## Reading the response

The script returns JSON:

```json
{
  "totalClaimableSol": 4.728391,
  "assets": 3.921482,
  "buffers": 0.806909,
  "tokenCount": 183,
  "bufferCount": 3
}
```

- `totalClaimableSol` — total SOL reclaimable (sum of assets + buffers)
- `assets` — SOL from dormant token accounts (empty ATAs, dead memecoins, dust)
- `buffers` — SOL from program buffer accounts
- `tokenCount` — number of token accounts to close (may be 0 if backend hasn't added this yet)
- `bufferCount` — number of buffer accounts to close (may be 0 if backend hasn't added this yet)

If `tokenCount` and `bufferCount` are both 0 or missing, do NOT report account counts — just report the SOL totals.

## Formatting the response

**Show the exact SOL value returned by the API.** Do not round to 2 decimal places — show full precision (e.g. 4.728391, not 4.73).

**If totalClaimableSol > 0:**

Report the total, then break down by type if both are non-zero:

> Your wallet has **4.728391 SOL** reclaimable.
> - 3.921482 SOL from 183 token accounts
> - 0.806909 SOL from 3 buffer accounts
>
> You can claim at: https://unclaimedsol.com

If only one type has value, skip the breakdown — just show the total.

**If totalClaimableSol is 0:**

> This wallet has no reclaimable SOL. All accounts are active or already optimized.

**If the script returns an error:**

> Unable to scan this wallet right now. You can try directly at https://unclaimedsol.com — connect your wallet there to see your reclaimable SOL.

Do NOT tell the user to "paste" or "enter" the address into a search box. The website uses wallet connection, not a search box.

## Rules

- This is **read-only**. No transactions are executed. No keys are needed.
- **Never** ask the user for their seed phrase, private key, or mnemonic.
- Only accept Solana **public keys** (base58, 32-44 characters).
- If the input doesn't look like a valid Solana address, ask the user to double-check it.
- **Always disclose the external API call and get user consent before scanning.**
