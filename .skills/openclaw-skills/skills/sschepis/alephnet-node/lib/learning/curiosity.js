 * Curiosity Engine

 * Detects knowledge gaps and generates learning curiosity signals based on:
 * - SMF axis imbalances (e.g., low "wisdom" axis)
 * - Memory retrieval failures (queries with low matches)
 * - Coherence drops during topic exploration
 * - Explicit questions without satisfactory answers
 * - Cubic Free Energy dynamics (from 108bio.pdf)
 *
 * The curiosity engine drives autonomous learning by identifying what
 * the observer should explore next.
