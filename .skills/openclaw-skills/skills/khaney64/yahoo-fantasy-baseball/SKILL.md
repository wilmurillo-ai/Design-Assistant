# Yahoo Fantasy Baseball

Query your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league: view data and optimize your daily lineup via the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API. Read-only — no roster modifications are made.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `yahoo_fantasy_api` — Yahoo Fantasy Sports API wrapper

**Installation:** Before first use, run `--setup` to create a local `.deps/` virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Subsequent runs reuse the existing venv. To force a clean reinstall, delete the `.deps/` directory and run `--setup` again.

```bash
python3 yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py --setup
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a Yahoo Developer App

1. Go to [https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/)
2. Click "Create an App"
3. Set **Redirect URI** to `oob` (out-of-band — Yahoo displays the auth code on screen instead of redirecting to a URL)
4. Copy the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py auth
```

Follow the prompts to enter your Consumer Key and Secret. A browser window opens for Yahoo OAuth authorization. Tokens are cached automatically — you only need to do this once.

### 3. Find Your League

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py leagues
```

### 4. Set Defaults

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py config --league 12345
```

The skill auto-detects your team within the league. You can also set it explicitly:

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py config --league 12345 --team 3
```

```

### Daily Management

```bash
# Today: roster status with MLB schedule awareness (shortcut for 'day' with today's date)
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py today

# Day: roster status for a specific date
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py day --date 2026-03-25
```

Groups your roster into ACTIVE (team playing), NOT PLAYING (team off), INJURED, and BENCH. Shows each player's eligible positions, game start times (local timezone), and flags probable starting pitchers. Displays "First pitch" time at the top so you know when to finalize your lineup. The `today` command is a shortcut for `day` with today's date.

```bash
# Standouts: yesterday's top performers across all league teams
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py standouts [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--min-points N] [--count N]
```

Fetches daily player stats for all rostered players across every team in the league and identifies standout performances. Output is split into two sections:
1. **Top Performers** — players in active lineup slots who scored the most fantasy points
2. **Left on the Bench** — benched players with notable performances (points that didn't count)

Each player shows their fantasy points, key stat line, and achievement badges (e.g., "Multi-HR", "10+ K", "Gem", "CGSO"). Defaults to yesterday; use `--date` for a specific date.

```bash
# Lineup check: verify active players are in confirmed MLB lineups
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py lineup-check
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py lineup-check --date 2026-04-01
```

Cross-references active fantasy roster players against confirmed MLB batting lineups (from MLB Stats API `hydrate=lineups`). Flags position players who are in a starting fantasy slot but NOT in their team's confirmed real-life lineup (e.g., scratched, resting, benched vs lefty/righty). Pitchers are excluded (they don't appear in batting lineups). Players whose team's lineup hasn't been posted are NOT flagged — only players whose lineup IS posted and who are absent. Lineups are typically posted 1-3 hours before game time.

```bash
# Optimize: smart roster analysis with suggestions
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py optimize
```

Three analysis categories:
1. **Lineup changes** — optimal batter assignment via constraint solver (position-aware, fills restrictive slots before UTIL). Outputs grouped swap instructions showing who starts (from bench), who gets benched, and any intermediate position reshuffles needed within that chain (e.g., a UTIL player sliding to 1B to make room). Pure position shuffles among active slots (without bench involvement) are omitted. Also checks confirmed MLB batting lineups — players confirmed not in their team's lineup are treated as unavailable (score 0) and will be moved to bench. Players whose games have already started are locked in place (Yahoo locks roster slots at first pitch) and excluded from the solver.
2. **Pitcher rotation** — priority-based pitcher slot optimization with swap suggestions. Relief pitchers whose teams are playing today are prioritized over non-starting SPs or pitchers whose teams are off. Probable starters get highest priority. Outputs grouped swap instructions (same format as batter swaps). Locked games are excluded.
3. **IL management** — players with IL designations (IL, IL10, IL15, IL60) not in IL slots, cleared players still in IL. DTD players are excluded since Yahoo does not allow moving them to IL.

Each move includes team, opponent, and score context. Moves to BN may include a `reason` indicator:
- `⚠️` — player not in confirmed MLB lineup (urgent — they won't play)
- `🔒` — player's game has already started (locked by Yahoo)
- `📅` — player's team is off today

**Early-season preseason rank blending:** The optimizer blends Yahoo's preseason overall rank (OR) into player scores during the first weeks of the season, when current-year stats are too small a sample to be reliable. The blending schedule:
- **Weeks 1–2**: Full weight — preseason rank contributes up to 15 bonus points (rank 1 gets the max, last-ranked gets 0)
- **Weeks 3–6**: Linear taper — preseason influence decreases by ~20% per week
- **Week 7+**: Zero weight — scoring is based entirely on current-season stats

This prevents the optimizer from overreacting to small early-season slumps (e.g., benching a star who went 0-for-8 in the first series). The preseason ranks are fetched via one additional Yahoo API call (`sort=OR, status=T`) per optimize run.

### JSON

All commands support `--format json` for structured output.

### Discord

All commands support `--format discord` which wraps text output in code blocks.

## Output Fields

- **name** — Player's full name
- **player_id** — Yahoo player ID (numeric)
- **positions** — Eligible fantasy positions (e.g., OF, SP, Util)
- **selected_position** — Current lineup slot
- **team** — Real MLB team abbreviation
- **status** — Injury designation (IL, IL-60, DTD, etc.)
- **game_time** — Game start time in local timezone (today/day commands)
- **first_pitch** — Earliest game start time across all games (today/day commands, JSON top-level)
- **percent_owned** — Ownership percentage (free agents)
- **player_position** — Display position (draft results)

## Limitations

- **Rate limits**: Yahoo enforces API rate limits. Avoid rapid-fire requests.
- **Season scope**: Data is scoped to the configured season. Use `--season` for historical data.
- **OAuth tokens**: Tokens auto-refresh but may eventually expire, requiring re-authentication via `auth`.
- **MLB schedule**: The `today`, `day`, `optimize`, and `lineup-check` commands use the MLB Stats API for schedule data (off days, probable pitchers, confirmed batting lineups). This data is not available from the Yahoo Fantasy API.

## Credential Storage

**Preferred: Environment variables.** Set `YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY` and `YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET` via OpenClaw config or your shell environment. The skill will use these automatically — no need to run `auth`. Note: credentials are still written to `oauth2.json` on disk because the underlying `yahoo_oauth` library requires a file for token management. File permissions are set to 0600 on Unix.

**Alternative: Interactive setup.** Run the `auth` command to enter credentials interactively. Tokens are stored in `~/.openclaw/credentials/yahoo-fantasy/`:
- `oauth2.json` — OAuth consumer key/secret and tokens (managed by yahoo_oauth, file permissions set to 0600 on Unix)
- `yahoo-fantasy.json` — Default league_id, team_id, season

Legacy YFPY `.env` credentials are auto-migrated to `oauth2.json` on first use.

## Notes

- Data is sourced from the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API via the [yahoo-fantasy-api](https://github.com/spilchen/yahoo_fantasy_api) library.
- MLB schedule and probable pitcher data comes from the [MLB Stats API](https://statsapi.mlb.com/) (stdlib only, no dependencies).
- Run `--setup` to create a local venv at `.deps/` and install dependencies before first use.
- Auto-detect identifies your team using `league.team_key()`. If detection fails, use `config --team <ID>` to set it manually.
