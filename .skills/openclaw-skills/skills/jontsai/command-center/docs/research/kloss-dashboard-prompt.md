## Their 8-Page Architecture

| Page      | Tabs                        | Our Equivalent                            |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| HOME      | —                           | ✅ Have (hero + panels)                   |
| OPS       | Operations, Tasks, Calendar | ⚠️ Partial (cron only)                    |
| AGENTS    | Agents, Models              | ⚠️ Partial (sessions, no model inventory) |
| CHAT      | Chat, Command               | ❌ Don't have                             |
| CONTENT   | —                           | ❌ Don't have                             |
| COMMS     | Comms, CRM                  | ❌ Don't have                             |
| KNOWLEDGE | Knowledge, Ecosystem        | ⚠️ Have memory browser                    |
| CODE      | —                           | ❌ Don't have                             |

## Key Features We're Missing

### High Priority (Differentiators)

1. **Chat Interface** — Talk to agent from dashboard + voice input
2. **Models Inventory** — Show all models, routing rules, costs, failovers
3. **Knowledge Search** — Full-text search across workspace files
4. **Auto-refresh indicator** — "LIVE" badge + "AUTO 15S" countdown

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

5. **Revenue/Business Tracker** — Revenue, burn, net
6. **Content Pipeline** — Kanban for content drafts
7. **Code/Repos View** — Git repos, branches, dirty files
8. **Observations Feed** — Agent observations/learnings
9. **Agent SOUL/RULES Display** — Show personality + capabilities

### Lower Priority (Context-Specific)

10. **CRM/Client Pipeline** — For consulting/agency use
11. **Ecosystem View** — Multi-product portfolio
12. **Calendar Integration** — Weekly view

## Design Notes (Steal These)

### Glass Card Style

```css
bg-white/[0.03] backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/[0.06]
```

### Typography

- `clamp(0.45rem, 0.75vw, 0.6875rem)` for fluid nav scaling
- 10-14px body text
- Inter or system font stack

### Animation

- Stagger animations: 0.05s delay per card
- Spring physics on interactions
- `layoutId` for tab transitions

### UX Patterns

- Skeleton loading states
- Empty states with helpful messaging
- Live indicator dot
- Custom scrollbar styling
