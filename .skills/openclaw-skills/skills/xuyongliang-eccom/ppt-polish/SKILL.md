description: Rebuild, beautify, and optimize editable PowerPoint flowcharts, topology diagrams, architecture diagrams, and process visuals from existing PPT/PPTX files or source images. Use when the user asks to optimize a just-uploaded PPT, restyle a diagram slide, turn an image into an editable PPT diagram, improve presentation readability, unify shapes/colors/layout, or produce a cleaner client-ready diagram page.

# PPT Polish

Optimize diagram-heavy PPT pages so they become clearer, more editable, and more presentation-ready.

Prefer rebuilding structure over cosmetic tweaks when the original slide is messy. The goal is not just “make it prettier”, but “make it readable, editable, and reusable”.

## Core workflow

1. Identify the source form
   - Existing editable PPT/PPTX slide
   - Screenshot/image of a diagram
   - Mixed case: image already placed inside a PPT

2. Classify the diagram
   - Flowchart / process map
   - System topology / architecture diagram
   - Org / hierarchy diagram
   - Dense infographic-like technical diagram

3. Preserve the information structure
   - Extract layers, groups, nodes, and major relationships first
   - Decide what is primary path vs supporting path
   - Do not start from colors or decoration

4. Rebuild or polish in PowerPoint
   - If the slide is already editable and structurally decent, adjust layout/style directly
   - If the slide is messy or image-based, reconstruct shapes/text/connectors instead of polishing the pasted image

5. Final quality pass
   - Improve readability for presentation
   - Ensure all important items remain editable
   - Reduce visual noise and accidental line crossings

## Decision rules

### When polishing an existing PPT

Prefer direct editing when:
- Text is already editable
- Shapes are mostly separable
- Layout is salvageable

Prefer rebuilding on a new slide when:
- The current slide is essentially a screenshot
- Elements are badly misaligned or inconsistent
- Connectors are too chaotic to repair efficiently
- The user wants a more premium/client-facing result

### When starting from an image

Use the image only as reference.

Do not treat “insert image into PPT” as completion. A valid result should have editable:
- titles
- containers
- nodes
- text
- connectors

## Layout heuristics

### Flowcharts

- Keep a clear main direction: left→right or top→bottom
- Put decision nodes at branch points
- Keep similar node types same size and style
- Reduce crossing lines, even if that means slightly changing spacing

### Topology / architecture diagrams

- Group by layer or domain first
- Put gateways / hubs / central schedulers near the center
- Put external actors at the edge
- Put data/storage below or on a dedicated side band
- Put ops/monitoring in a side rail or bottom band

### Dense technical diagrams

- Keep the density if that is part of the original style
- Still enforce consistent spacing, headers, and color logic
- Use container regions so the eye can parse clusters quickly

## Styling heuristics

- Use 1 visual language per slide, not several mixed styles
- Keep a consistent color family by layer/category
- Use emphasis only for core nodes and main paths
- Use lighter visual weight for supporting lines and less important modules
- Prefer subtle rounded rectangles and clean borders over excessive effects
- Avoid overusing gradients, shadows, and icons unless they help meaningfully

## Read bundled references when needed

- Read `references/image-to-ppt-flowchart-sop.md` for image→editable-flowchart reconstruction workflow
- Read `references/ppt-topology-from-image.md` for topology-specific decomposition and layer mapping

## Expected outputs

Depending on the request, produce one or more of:
- optimized `.pptx` file
- rebuilt single-slide diagram page
- alternate visual versions (e.g. dark, clean, infographic)
- structure draft in Markdown / Mermaid before rebuilding

## Quality checklist

Before finishing, verify:

- The main information structure is preserved
- Important text is editable
- Shapes are editable rather than flattened into an image
- Layers/groups are obvious at a glance
- Alignment and spacing are consistent
- Connector hierarchy is readable
- The page is suitable for presentation, not just archival

## Notes

When multiple output versions exist, keep filenames explicit, such as:
- `*-refined.pptx`
- `*-infographic.pptx`
- `*-dark.pptx`
- `*-polished.pptx`

Prefer descriptive naming over generic names like `final-final2.pptx`.
