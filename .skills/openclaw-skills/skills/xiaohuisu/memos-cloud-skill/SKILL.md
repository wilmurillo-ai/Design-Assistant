# MemOS Cloud Server Skill

This skill allows the Agent to interact with MemOS Cloud APIs for memory search, addition, deletion, and feedback.

## ⚠️ Setup & Safety Rules (MUST READ)

Before executing any API operations, you (the Agent) must ensure the following environment variables are configured:

1. **Obtain Credentials**:
   - `MEMOS_API_KEY` (MemOS Cloud Service API Key) and `MEMOS_USER_ID` (Unique identifier for the current user) must be configured.
2. **Auto Configuration**:
   - If not present, prompt the user to save these variables to their global environment configuration (e.g., in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`).

## 🛠 Core Commands

You can execute operations directly via the `memos_cloud.py` script. The script automatically reads the `MEMOS_API_KEY` environment variable. All operation requests and responses are output in JSON format.

### 1. Search Memory (`/v1/search/memory`)

Search for long-term memories relevant to the user's query.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py search <user_id> "<query>" [--conversation-id <id>]
```
**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py search "$MEMOS_USER_ID" "Python related project experience"
```

### 2. Add Message (`/v1/add/message`)

Used to store high-value content from multi-turn conversations to the cloud.
- `conversation_id`: Required. The ID of the current conversation.
- `messages`: Required. Must be a valid JSON string containing a list with `role` and `content` fields.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py add_message <user_id> <conversation_id> '<messages_json_string>'
```
**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py add_message "$MEMOS_USER_ID" "topic-123" '[{"role":"user","content":"I like apples"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay, I noted that"}]'
```

### 3. Delete Memory (`/v1/delete/memory`)

Delete stored memories on the cloud. According to the API spec, `memory_ids` is strictly required.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Delete by Memory IDs (comma-separated)
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py delete "id1,id2,id3"
```

### 4. Add Feedback (`/v1/add/feedback`)

Add feedback regarding a conversation to correct or reinforce memory in the cloud.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py add_feedback <user_id> <conversation_id> "<feedback_content>" [--allow-knowledgebase-ids "kb1,kb2"]
```
**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/memos-cloud-server/memos_cloud.py add_feedback "$MEMOS_USER_ID" "topic-123" "The previous answer was not detailed enough"
```
