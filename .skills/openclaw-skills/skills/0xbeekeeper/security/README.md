Evaluates 4 dimensions (5 if Web3 usage is detected):

| Dimension | What's checked |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Skill & Code Safety** | Scan all installed skills with 24 detection rules |
| **Credential & Secrets** | File permissions on `~/.ssh/`, `~/.gnupg/`, leaked keys and API tokens |
| **Network & System** | Dangerous open ports, suspicious cron jobs, sensitive env vars |
| **Runtime Protection** | Security hooks, audit log, whether skills have been scanned |
| **Web3 Safety** | Wallet-draining patterns, unlimited approvals, GoPlus API config (only if Web3 detected) |

Scores are combined into a composite 0–100 health score with a tier:
