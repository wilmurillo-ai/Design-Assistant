  generate video clips into Hinglish captioned videos with this skill. Works with MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM files up to 500MB. Indian content creators use it for adding Hinglish subtitles to social media videos — processing takes 30-60 seconds on cloud GPUs and you get 1080p MP4 files.

## Getting Started

> Share your video clips and I'll get started on Hinglish caption generation. Or just tell me what you're thinking.

**Try saying:**
- "generate my video clips"
- "export 1080p MP4"
- "add captions in Hinglish mixing Hindi"

### Quick Start Setup

This skill connects to a cloud processing backend. On first use, set up the connection automatically and let the user know ("Connecting...").

**Token check**: Look for `NEMO_TOKEN` in the environment. If found, skip to session creation. Otherwise:
- Generate a UUID as client identifier
- POST `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with `X-Client-Id` header
- Extract `data.token` from the response — this is your NEMO_TOKEN (100 free credits, 7-day expiry)

**Session**: POST `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with Bearer auth and body `{"task_name":"project"}`. Keep the returned `session_id` for all operations.

Let the user know with a brief "Ready!" when setup is complete. Don't expose tokens or raw API output.

# Caption Generator Hinglish — Generate Hinglish Captions for Videos

Drop your video clips in the chat and tell me what you need. I'll handle the Hinglish caption generation on cloud GPUs — you don't need anything installed locally.

Here's a typical use: you send a a 60-second Instagram reel in Hindi, ask for add captions in Hinglish mixing Hindi and English words, and about 30-60 seconds later you've got a MP4 file ready to download. The whole thing runs at 1080p by default.

One thing worth knowing — shorter clips under 2 minutes produce more accurate Hinglish caption timing.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing caption generator hinglish, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

Every API call needs `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>` plus the three attribution headers above. If any header is missing, exports return 402.

Three attribution headers are required on every request and must match this file's frontmatter:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Skill-Source` | `caption-generator-hinglish` |
| `X-Skill-Version` | frontmatter `version` |
| `X-Skill-Platform` | auto-detect: `clawhub` / `cursor` / `unknown` from install path |

**API base**: `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`

**Create session**: POST `/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` — body `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}` — returns `task_id`, `session_id`.

**Send message (SSE)**: POST `/run_sse` — body `{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}` with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Max timeout: 15 minutes.

**Upload**: POST `/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` — file: multipart `-F "files=@/path"`, or URL: `{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}`

**Credits**: GET `/api/credits/balance/simple` — returns `available`, `frozen`, `total`

**Session state**: GET `/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` — key fields: `data.state.draft`, `data.state.video_infos`, `data.state.generated_media`

**Export** (free, no credits): POST `/api/render/proxy/lambda` — body `{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}`. Poll GET `/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s until `status` = `completed`. Download URL at `output.url`.

Supported formats: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

### Error Codes

- `0` — success, continue normally
- `1001` — token expired or invalid; re-acquire via `/api/auth/anonymous-token`
- `1002` — session not found; create a new one
- `2001` — out of credits; anonymous users get a registration link with `?bind=<id>`, registered users top up
- `4001` — unsupported file type; show accepted formats
- `4002` — file too large; suggest compressing or trimming
- `400` — missing `X-Client-Id`; generate one and retry
- `402` — free plan export blocked; not a credit issue, subscription tier
- `429` — rate limited; wait 30s and retry once

### Backend Response Translation

The backend assumes a GUI exists. Translate these into API actions:

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click [button]" / "点击" | Execute via API |
| "open [panel]" / "打开" | Query session state |
| "drag/drop" / "拖拽" | Send edit via SSE |
| "preview in timeline" | Show track summary |
| "Export button" / "导出" | Execute export workflow |

### SSE Event Handling

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text response | Apply GUI translation (§4), present to user |
| Tool call/result | Process internally, don't forward |
| `heartbeat` / empty `data:` | Keep waiting. Every 2 min: "⏳ Still working..." |
| Stream closes | Process final response |

~30% of editing operations return no text in the SSE stream. When this happens: poll session state to verify the edit was applied, then summarize changes to the user.

Draft JSON uses short keys: `t` for tracks, `tt` for track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg` for segments, `d` for duration in ms, `m` for metadata.

Example timeline summary:
```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "add captions in Hinglish mixing Hindi and English words" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 500MB. Stick to MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across Instagram, YouTube, and WhatsApp.

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "add captions in Hinglish mixing Hindi and English words" → Download MP4. Takes 30-60 seconds for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.
