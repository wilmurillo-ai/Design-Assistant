   cd api
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Start frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd web
   bun run dev
   ```

### Run the Test

```bash
cd web
bun run test:e2e tests/full-journey.spec.ts
```

Or with UI mode (recommended for first run):
```bash
bun run test:e2e:ui tests/full-journey.spec.ts
```

Or headed mode (see browser):
```bash
bun run test:e2e:headed tests/full-journey.spec.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test fails at KYC step
- Ensure backend is running
- Check that auto-approval is enabled (dev mode)
- Verify test images are created in `test-images/` directory

### Test fails at wallet generation
- Ensure browser has necessary permissions
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Verify wallet generation libraries are installed

### Test fails at agent actions
- Verify API keys are stored correctly
- Check backend logs for authentication errors
- Ensure campaign ID is valid

## Notes

- Test images are automatically cleaned up after use
- Database is cleared before test (fresh start)
- All actions use real API calls (not mocked)
- Test runs in ~30-60 seconds depending on network
