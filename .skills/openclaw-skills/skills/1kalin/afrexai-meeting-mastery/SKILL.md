## 1. PRE-MEETING PREPARATION

### When a Meeting is Approaching (trigger: calendar check or user request)

#### Step 1: Gather Meeting Context
```
Meeting: [title]
Time: [date/time + timezone]
Duration: [length]
Type: [internal/external/sales/interview/1:1/board/standup]
Attendees: [list]
Location/Link: [virtual link or address]
Recurring: [yes/no — if yes, pull last meeting's notes]
```

#### Step 2: Attendee Intelligence Report

For EACH attendee, research and compile:

**Internal attendees:**
- Role and department
- Recent projects/wins they've mentioned
- Any open items from previous meetings with them
- Communication style notes (if tracked)

**External attendees:**
- Company, role, tenure (web search)
- Recent company news (funding, launches, leadership changes)
- LinkedIn summary points
- Mutual connections or shared history
- Previous meeting history (check notes archive)

**Output format:**
```
👤 [Name] — [Role] at [Company]
   Background: [2-3 key facts]
   Recent news: [anything relevant from last 30 days]
   History: [previous interactions, if any]
   Watch for: [topics they care about, sensitivities]
```

#### Step 3: Smart Agenda Builder

Based on meeting type, generate a structured agenda:

**Sales/Prospect Meeting:**
1. Rapport & context (2 min) — use attendee intel for warm opener
2. Discovery/situation review (10 min) — prepared questions below
3. Solution alignment (15 min) — map their pain to your offering
4. Objection handling (5 min) — pre-loaded responses
5. Next steps & commitment (3 min) — always end with clear action

**Internal Strategy/Planning:**
1. Context & objectives (2 min)
2. Review: what's changed since last meeting (5 min)
3. Key decisions needed (15 min) — list each with options
4. Action items & owners (5 min)
5. Parking lot (2 min)

**1:1 / Check-in:**
1. Personal check-in (2 min)
2. Their priorities/blockers (10 min) — let them lead
3. Your updates/requests (5 min)
4. Career/growth topic (5 min) — rotate monthly
5. Action items (3 min)

**Interview (you're hiring):**
1. Welcome & role overview (3 min)
2. Background deep-dive (10 min) — targeted questions from CV
3. Technical/skill assessment (15 min) — scenario-based
4. Culture fit & values (5 min)
5. Their questions (5 min)
6. Next steps (2 min)

**Board/Investor Update:**
1. KPI dashboard review (5 min)
2. Wins since last meeting (3 min)
3. Challenges & asks (10 min)
4. Strategic decisions (10 min)
5. Q&A (5 min)

#### Step 4: Prepared Questions

Generate 5-8 smart questions based on:
- Meeting type and objectives
- Attendee research findings
- Previous meeting action items
- Industry/market context

**Question quality checklist:**
- [ ] Open-ended (not yes/no)
- [ ] Shows you've done homework
- [ ] Drives toward a decision or insight
- [ ] Not already answered in available materials

#### Step 5: Pre-Meeting Brief

Compile everything into a single scannable brief:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 MEETING BRIEF: [Title]
🕐 [Date] [Time] ([Duration])
📍 [Location/Link]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OBJECTIVE: [1-sentence goal for this meeting]

ATTENDEES:
[Attendee intelligence summaries]

AGENDA:
[Structured agenda with time allocations]

KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK:
[Numbered list]

CONTEXT FROM LAST MEETING:
[Previous action items, decisions, open threads]

PREPARATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Materials/deck ready
- [ ] Demo environment tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Relevant data points loaded
- [ ] Calendar buffer after meeting (for notes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 2. LIVE MEETING NOTES

### Structured Capture Template

When asked to take notes during or right after a meeting:

```markdown
# Meeting Notes: [Title]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  **Time:** [HH:MM]  **Duration:** [actual]
**Attendees:** [who was actually there — note no-shows]
**Type:** [category]

## Key Discussion Points
1. [Topic] — [summary of discussion, who said what]
2. [Topic] — [summary]

## Decisions Made
| # | Decision | Made by | Rationale |
|---|----------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | [what was decided] | [who] | [why] |

## Action Items
| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Priority |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | [task] | [name] | [date] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |

## Open Questions / Parking Lot
- [question or deferred topic]

## Key Quotes (verbatim when important)
- "[exact words]" — [Speaker]

## Sentiment / Energy Read
[Brief note on meeting tone — was it productive? tense? aligned?]

## Follow-Up Required
- [ ] Send summary to attendees
- [ ] Update [system/doc] with decisions
- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting (if needed)
```

### Smart Capture Rules
- Attribute statements to speakers when possible
- Distinguish between opinions, decisions, and action items
- Flag disagreements — note both sides
- Capture exact numbers, dates, commitments (these get misremembered)
- Note what was NOT discussed that should have been

---

## 3. POST-MEETING ENGINE

### Immediate (within 30 minutes)

**Auto-generate meeting summary email:**
```
Subject: Meeting Summary: [Title] — [Date]

Hi [attendees],

Thanks for the productive session. Here's what we covered:

**Decisions:**
[bullet list]

**Action Items:**
[table: what | who | by when]

**Next Meeting:** [date/time if scheduled]

Let me know if I missed anything.

[signature]
```

**Quality checklist for summaries:**
- [ ] Every action item has an owner AND deadline
- [ ] Decisions are stated as facts, not "we discussed"
- [ ] No jargon unexplained for external attendees
- [ ] Tone matches relationship (formal for clients, casual for team)

### Follow-Up Tracking

Track all action items in a running log:

```json
{
  "meeting_id": "2026-02-13-client-review",
  "actions": [
    {
      "item": "Send revised proposal",
      "owner": "Kalin",
      "deadline": "2026-02-15",
      "status": "pending",
      "reminded": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Reminder cadence:**
- 24 hours before deadline → gentle reminder
- On deadline day → status check
- 48 hours overdue → escalation flag

### Follow-Up Sequences by Meeting Type

**After Sales Meeting:**
1. Same day: Summary email + any promised materials
2. Day 2: "Thinking about what you mentioned about [specific pain]..."
3. Day 5: Relevant case study or resource
4. Day 10: "Any questions? Happy to jump on a quick call"

**After Interview:**
1. Same day: Thank you + timeline for decision
2. Internal: Scorecard completed within 24 hours
3. Decision deadline: Force a hire/no-hire call

**After Strategy Meeting:**
1. Same day: Notes + decisions distributed
2. Day 3: Check on action item progress
3. Before next meeting: Pre-meeting status update

## 4. RELATIONSHIP MEMORY

### Contact Cards

Maintain a relationship file per key contact:

```yaml
name: "Jane Smith"
company: "Acme Corp"
role: "VP Engineering"
first_met: "2026-01-15"
meetings_count: 4
communication_style: "Data-driven, prefers email, gets straight to business"
personal_notes:
  - Has twin daughters starting university this year
  - Marathon runner — ran Boston 2025
  - Vegetarian (for restaurant picks)
topics_of_interest:
  - Platform migration
  - Team scaling
  - AI/ML integration
last_interaction: "2026-02-10"
open_threads:
  - "Waiting on their security review"
  - "Interested in Phase 2 proposal"
sentiment_trend: "positive — increasingly engaged"
```

### Before Each Meeting: Auto-Pull
- Pull contact cards for all attendees
- Surface open threads and last interaction
- Flag if it's been >30 days since contact (relationship at risk)

---

## 5. MEETING ROI TRACKER

### Score Every Meeting (Post-Meeting)

```
Meeting ROI Score: [1-10]

Criteria:
- Decisions made: [0-3 points] (0=none, 1=minor, 2=significant, 3=critical)
- Actions generated: [0-2 points] (0=none, 1=some, 2=clear+owned)
- Could've been async: [0-2 points] (0=definitely, 1=maybe, 2=needed live)
- Right people present: [0-1 point]
- Stayed on time: [0-1 point]
- Energy/morale impact: [0-1 point]
```

### Weekly Meeting Audit

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 WEEKLY MEETING AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total meetings: [X]
Total hours: [X]
Average ROI score: [X]/10

🟢 High-value (8+): [list]
🟡 Medium (5-7): [list — consider shortening]
🔴 Low-value (<5): [list — consider eliminating or making async]

Recommendation: [specific meetings to cut, combine, or restructure]
Time recoverable: [X hours/week]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Meeting Hygiene Rules
- No agenda = decline or request one
- No clear objective = ask "what decision are we making?"
- >6 attendees = likely too many (suggest trimming)
- Recurring with no changes = suggest async update instead
- Back-to-back meetings = flag for buffer time

---

## 6. TEMPLATES & QUICK COMMANDS

### Quick Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Prep for [meeting]" | Full pre-meeting brief |
| "Notes from [meeting]" | Generate structured notes template |
| "Follow up on [meeting]" | Check action items, draft follow-ups |
| "Meeting audit" | Weekly ROI analysis |
| "Who is [name]?" | Pull contact card |
| "Cancel [meeting]" | Draft polite cancellation with reason |
| "Reschedule [meeting]" | Draft reschedule request with alternatives |

### Cancellation Template (when meeting isn't justified)
```
Hi [name],

I'd like to suggest we handle [topic] async this week — I can send
a written update covering [specific items] which might save us both
30 minutes.

Happy to keep the meeting if you'd prefer live discussion. Let me know.
```

### Declining Meeting Invites (when appropriate)
```
Thanks for the invite. A couple quick questions:
1. What decision or outcome are we aiming for?
2. Is there a pre-read I should review?
3. Could I contribute async instead?

Want to make sure I'm adding value if I join.
```

## Edge Cases

- **No-shows:** Note them. If recurring, flag the pattern.
- **Meeting hijacked:** Note original agenda vs actual discussion. Flag for next time.
- **Confidential meetings:** Mark notes as `CONFIDENTIAL` — don't include in weekly audit details.
- **Multi-timezone:** Always show times in all attendees' timezones in briefs.
- **Recurring meeting fatigue:** If ROI score drops below 5 for 3 consecutive weeks, suggest restructuring.
- **Last-minute meetings:** Abbreviated prep — focus on attendee intel and one key question only.
- **Walking into someone else's meeting:** Quick context mode — "What do I need to know in 60 seconds?"
