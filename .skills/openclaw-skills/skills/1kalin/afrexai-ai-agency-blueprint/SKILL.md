## Phase 1: Agency Readiness Assessment

### Quick Health Check (Score /16)

| Signal | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Service definition | Clear packages with pricing | "We do AI stuff" | No defined services |
| Sales pipeline | 3+ qualified leads | 1-2 warm contacts | No pipeline |
| Delivery process | Documented SOPs | Ad hoc but works | Chaos every project |
| Client results | Case studies with ROI | Happy clients, no data | No proof of results |
| Pricing confidence | Value-based, profitable | Hourly, breaking even | Undercharging, losing money |
| Tech stack | Proven, repeatable | Different every project | Experimenting on client dime |
| Legal protection | MSA + SOW + insurance | Basic contract | Handshake deals |
| Financial health | 3+ months runway, profitable | Month-to-month | Burning cash |

**Score:** 2 per healthy, 1 per warning, 0 per critical. Target: 12+

## Phase 2: Business Model Design

### Model Selection Matrix

| Model | Revenue/Client | Scalability | Complexity | Best For |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Done-For-You (DFY)** | $5K-$50K+ | Low (time-bound) | High | Technical founders, premium positioning |
| **Done-With-You (DWY)** | $2K-$15K | Medium | Medium | Consultants, coaches |
| **Productized Service** | $1K-$5K/mo | High | Medium | Repeatable solutions |
| **SaaS + Service** | $500-$5K/mo | Very High | Very High | Platform builders |
| **Training/Education** | $500-$5K | Very High | Low | Thought leaders |

### Recommended Progression

```
Stage 1 (Months 1-3): DFY custom projects → learn what clients actually need
Stage 2 (Months 4-6): Productize top 2-3 solutions → repeatable delivery
Stage 3 (Months 7-12): Recurring revenue (retainers + managed services)
Stage 4 (Year 2+): Platform/SaaS layer on top of services
```

### The $10K/mo Solo Operator Path

```yaml
solo_operator:
  target: "$10K/mo in 90 days"
  model: "2 DFY projects at $5K each"
  time_investment: "20-30 hrs/week"
  sales_needed: "Close 2 of 10 qualified leads (20% close rate)"
  pipeline_needed: "30 conversations → 10 qualified → 2 closed"
  daily_actions:
    - "2 outreach messages to ideal clients"
    - "1 piece of content (LinkedIn post, thread, demo)"
    - "1 discovery call if pipeline allows"
```

### The $50K/mo Agency Path

```yaml
agency_path:
  target: "$50K/mo by month 12"
  model: "Mix of DFY ($10-25K) + retainers ($2-5K/mo)"
  team: "You + 1 delivery person + 1 VA"
  client_mix:
    - "2 active DFY projects: $20-50K"
    - "5-10 retainer clients: $10-50K/mo"
  sales_system: "Inbound content + outbound outreach + referrals"
```

---

## Phase 3: Service Catalog Design

### High-Demand AI Agent Services (Ranked by Market Demand)

| Service | Typical Price | Delivery Time | Demand Level | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Customer Support Automation** | $5K-$25K | 2-4 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Medium |
| **Sales Pipeline Automation** | $8K-$30K | 3-6 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | High |
| **Document Processing/Extraction** | $5K-$20K | 2-4 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Medium |
| **Internal Knowledge Base/RAG** | $10K-$40K | 4-8 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | High |
| **Email/Inbox Automation** | $3K-$15K | 1-3 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Low-Medium |
| **Meeting Scheduling + Follow-up** | $3K-$10K | 1-2 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥 | Low |
| **Content Generation Pipeline** | $5K-$20K | 2-4 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥 | Medium |
| **Data Analysis/Reporting Agents** | $8K-$25K | 3-5 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥 | High |
| **HR/Recruiting Automation** | $10K-$30K | 4-6 weeks | 🔥🔥🔥 | High |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | $15K-$50K | 6-10 weeks | 🔥🔥 | Very High |

### Service Package Template

```yaml
service_package:
  name: "[Service Name]"
  tagline: "[One-line value prop with outcome]"
  ideal_client:
    industry: "[Target industry]"
    company_size: "[Employee count / revenue range]"
    pain_point: "[Specific problem this solves]"
    current_cost: "[What they spend now doing this manually]"
  deliverables:
    - "[Specific deliverable 1]"
    - "[Specific deliverable 2]"
    - "[Specific deliverable 3]"
  timeline: "[X weeks]"
  pricing:
    setup_fee: 0
    monthly_retainer: 0  # if applicable
    pricing_model: "fixed|value-based|retainer"
  roi_promise: "[Expected ROI or savings]"
  scope_boundaries:
    included:
      - "[What's in scope]"
    excluded:
      - "[What's NOT in scope — critical for scope creep]"
  success_metrics:
    - metric: "[KPI name]"
      baseline: "[Current state]"
      target: "[Expected improvement]"
      measurement: "[How you'll prove it]"
```

### The "Week One Win" Framework

Every project MUST deliver a visible win in Week 1:

```
Day 1-2: Discovery + data access
Day 3-4: Build MVP automation (simplest high-impact workflow)
Day 5: Demo to client → "Here's what your agent did this week"
Week 2-4: Expand, refine, train, document
```

**Why this matters:** Clients who see results in Week 1 have 90%+ retention. Clients who wait 4 weeks for anything lose faith.

---

## Phase 4: Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

**Never price based on your time. Price based on client value.**

```
Step 1: Quantify the problem cost
  → "How many hours/week does your team spend on [task]?"
  → "What's the fully-loaded cost per hour?"
  → Annual cost = hours × rate × 52

Step 2: Calculate automation savings
  → Typical: 60-80% time reduction
  → Annual savings = Annual cost × reduction %

Step 3: Price at 10-20% of Year 1 savings
  → If saving $200K/year → price $20K-$40K
  → Client gets 5-10x ROI → easy yes
```

### Pricing Tiers (Good-Better-Best)

```yaml
pricing_tiers:
  starter:
    name: "Automate One"
    price: "$5,000-$8,000"
    includes: "1 workflow automated, basic integrations, 2 weeks delivery"
    best_for: "Testing the waters, budget-conscious"
    margin_target: "60%+"
  
  professional:
    name: "Automation Suite"
    price: "$15,000-$25,000"
    includes: "3-5 workflows, custom integrations, training, 4-6 weeks"
    best_for: "Serious about AI transformation"
    margin_target: "65%+"
    anchor: true  # This is your default recommendation
  
  enterprise:
    name: "AI Operations Partner"
    price: "$30,000-$50,000+ setup + $3-5K/mo retainer"
    includes: "Full department automation, dedicated support, ongoing optimization"
    best_for: "Companies going all-in on AI"
    margin_target: "70%+"
```

### Pricing Psychology Rules

1. **Always present 3 options** — middle option gets chosen 60% of the time
2. **Price in terms of ROI** — "$15K investment that saves $200K" not "$15K project"
3. **Annual framing** — "$5K/mo" sounds cheaper as "$60K/year for $500K in savings"
4. **Anchor high** — Present enterprise tier first in proposals
5. **Never discount** — Add scope instead ("I can't lower the price, but I can add X")
6. **Separate setup from recurring** — Setup is a one-time investment, recurring is the relationship

### When to Raise Prices

- Close rate > 50% → you're too cheap
- Close rate 30-50% → you're in the sweet spot  
- Close rate < 20% → positioning problem (not necessarily price)
- Every 3 new case studies → raise 15-25%
- After any project with >10x client ROI → raise for that service category

---

## Phase 5: Sales Process

### The AI Agency Sales Funnel

```
Awareness (Content + Outreach)
  → Interest (Lead magnet / free audit)
    → Discovery Call (15-30 min qualification)
      → Strategy Session (45-60 min deep dive)
        → Proposal (Sent within 24h)
          → Close (Follow up within 48h)
```

### Qualification Framework (BANT-AI)

```yaml
qualification:
  budget:
    question: "What's your budget range for this initiative?"
    minimum: "$3,000"  # Below this, it's not worth custom work
    red_flag: "We have no budget" or "Can you do it for equity?"
  
  authority:
    question: "Who else is involved in this decision?"
    ideal: "I'm the decision maker" or "Me and my CTO"
    red_flag: "I need to check with 5 people"
  
  need:
    question: "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 90 days?"
    ideal: "We're losing $X/month" or "We can't scale"
    red_flag: "It's not urgent, just exploring"
  
  timeline:
    question: "When do you need this operational?"
    ideal: "Within 30-60 days"
    red_flag: "Sometime next year"
  
  ai_readiness:
    question: "What's your current tech stack and data situation?"
    ideal: "We have APIs, structured data, technical team"
    red_flag: "We use paper forms and Excel"
```

### Discovery Call Script (15 minutes)

```
[0-2 min] Rapport + agenda
"Thanks for booking time. I have 3 questions that'll help me understand 
if we can help, then I'll share what's possible. Sound good?"

[2-8 min] Pain discovery
1. "Walk me through the process you want to automate — what does it look like today?"
2. "How many hours per week does your team spend on this?"
3. "What have you tried so far to solve this?"

[8-12 min] Quantify the impact
4. "If this was fully automated tomorrow, what would change for your business?"
5. "Roughly what's this costing you per month in time and errors?"

[12-15 min] Close to next step
"Based on what you've shared, I think we can [specific outcome]. 
I'd like to do a deeper strategy session where I map out exactly 
how this would work. Are you available [date]?"
```

### Proposal Template Structure

```yaml
proposal:
  sections:
    - title: "Executive Summary"
      content: "2-3 sentences: problem, solution, expected ROI"
    
    - title: "Current State"
      content: "Mirror back their pain in their words"
    
    - title: "Proposed Solution"
      content: "What you'll build, how it works, what they get"
    
    - title: "Expected Results"
      content: "Specific metrics: time saved, cost reduced, revenue gained"
    
    - title: "Investment"
      content: "3 tiers, ROI framing, payment terms"
    
    - title: "Timeline & Process"
      content: "Week-by-week delivery plan with milestones"
    
    - title: "Why Us"
      content: "Relevant case study, credentials, guarantee"
    
    - title: "Next Steps"
      content: "Sign by [date] to start [date]. Calendar link."
  
  rules:
    - "Send within 24 hours of strategy session"
    - "Max 4-5 pages — executives don't read novels"
    - "Include a deadline (valid for 14 days)"
    - "Always include 3 pricing options"
    - "Lead with ROI, not features"
```

### Outreach Templates

**LinkedIn Connection + DM Sequence:**

```
Day 1 — Connection request:
"Hey [Name], I saw [specific thing about their company]. 
Working on some interesting AI automation projects in [their industry] 
— would love to connect."

Day 3 — Value-first DM (after they accept):
"Thanks for connecting! Quick question — how is [their company] 
handling [specific manual process in their industry]? 
I recently helped [similar company] automate this and save 
[X hours/week]. Happy to share the approach if useful."

Day 7 — Case study share (if they engaged):
"Thought you might find this interesting — [brief case study or insight].
Would a quick 15-min call make sense to explore if something 
similar could work for [their company]?"
```

**Cold Email Template:**

```
Subject: [X hours/week] back for your [department] team

Hi [Name],

Noticed [specific observation about their company — hiring for 
manual role, using old tech, industry pain point].

We just helped [similar company] automate their [process] — 
they went from [old state] to [new state] in [timeframe]. 
[Specific metric: saved 40 hours/week, reduced errors 90%].

Worth a 15-minute call to see if something similar fits [Company]?

[Your name]
[One-line credential]
```

  □ Runbook / troubleshooting guide
  □ Handoff documentation
  □ Success metrics baseline
```

### Scope Creep Defense

| Client Says | You Say | Why |
|------------|---------|-----|
| "Can you also add..." | "Absolutely — let me scope that as Phase 2" | Protects timeline AND creates upsell |
| "This isn't quite right" | "Let's review the requirements doc together" | Anchors to agreed scope |
| "We need it faster" | "I can accelerate with [trade-off]. Which priority?" | Maintains quality |
| "Can you just quickly..." | "I'll log that in the enhancement backlog" | Prevents unbounded work |

### Client Communication Cadence

```yaml
communication:
  daily: "Async update in Slack/email — what was done, what's next, any blockers"
  weekly: "30-min sync — demo progress, get feedback, align priorities"
  milestone: "Formal sign-off at each phase gate"
  escalation: "Any blocker > 24h unsolved → escalate to project sponsor"
  
  rules:
    - "Over-communicate, especially in Week 1"
    - "Bad news travels fast — tell them before they find out"
    - "Always demo, never just describe"
    - "Record all training sessions"
```

---

## Phase 7: Technology Stack

### Recommended Agency Stack

| Layer | Tool | Cost | Why |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| **AI Framework** | OpenClaw / LangChain / CrewAI | Free-$50/mo | Agent orchestration |
| **LLM** | Claude / GPT-4 / local models | $20-500/mo | Core intelligence |
| **Automation** | n8n (self-hosted) / Make / Zapier | Free-$100/mo | Workflow orchestration |
| **Vector DB** | Pinecone / ChromaDB / Weaviate | Free-$70/mo | RAG / knowledge base |
| **Hosting** | Railway / Fly.io / AWS | $20-200/mo | Deployment |
| **Monitoring** | Langfuse / LangSmith | Free-$50/mo | LLM observability |
| **CRM** | HubSpot Free / Pipedrive | Free-$50/mo | Pipeline management |
| **Project Mgmt** | Linear / Notion | Free-$20/mo | Delivery tracking |
| **Contracts** | PandaDoc / DocuSign | $20-50/mo | Legal documents |
| **Payments** | Stripe | 2.9% + $0.30 | Billing |

### Stack Selection Rules

1. **Standardize ruthlessly** — Use the same stack for 80%+ of projects
2. **Client systems stay client systems** — Never move their data to your infrastructure without agreement
3. **Bill API costs to client** — LLM API costs are a pass-through, not your margin
4. **Self-host when possible** — More margin, more control, better for enterprise clients
5. **Document everything** — Client should be able to maintain without you (reduces your liability)

---

## Phase 8: Legal & Contracts

### Essential Legal Documents

```yaml
legal_stack:
  msa:
    name: "Master Service Agreement"
    purpose: "Governs the overall relationship"
    key_clauses:
      - "Limitation of liability (cap at contract value)"
      - "IP ownership (client owns deliverables, you retain methodologies)"
      - "Confidentiality / NDA"
      - "Termination (30-day notice, payment for work completed)"
      - "Indemnification"
      - "Dispute resolution (arbitration preferred)"
    
  sow:
    name: "Statement of Work"
    purpose: "Defines specific project scope, deliverables, timeline, price"
    key_sections:
      - "Scope of work (be EXTREMELY specific)"
      - "Deliverables list with acceptance criteria"
      - "Timeline with milestones"
      - "Payment schedule tied to milestones"
      - "Change order process"
      - "Client responsibilities (access, feedback timelines)"
    
  change_order:
    name: "Change Order Form"
    purpose: "Any scope change requires this signed BEFORE work begins"
    fields:
      - "Description of change"
      - "Impact on timeline"
      - "Additional cost"
      - "Approval signature"
```

### IP Ownership Rules

```
DEFAULT RULE: Client owns the custom deliverables. You retain your tools.

Specifically:
✅ Client owns: Custom agents, workflows, prompts written for them
✅ You retain: Your frameworks, templates, libraries, methodologies
✅ You retain: Right to use anonymized learnings for other clients
❌ Never: Give away your core platform/tools
❌ Never: Use one client's proprietary data for another client
```

### Insurance Minimums

| Coverage | Minimum | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **Professional Liability (E&O)** | $1M | Covers mistakes, bad advice, project failures |
| **General Liability** | $1M | Covers physical damages, bodily injury |
| **Cyber Liability** | $1M | Covers data breaches, AI-related incidents |

**Cost:** Approximately $1,500-$3,000/year for a small agency. Non-negotiable for enterprise clients.

---

## Phase 9: Client Retention & Expansion

### Retention Strategy

```yaml
retention:
  month_1:
    - "Weekly check-in calls"
    - "Performance dashboard with KPIs"
    - "Quick-win optimization (show improving metrics)"
  
  month_2_3:
    - "Bi-weekly calls"
    - "Monthly ROI report"
    - "Proactive suggestions for improvements"
  
  month_4_plus:
    - "Monthly calls"
    - "Quarterly business review (QBR)"
    - "Annual strategy session"
  
  expansion_triggers:
    - "Client mentions new pain point → propose Phase 2"
    - "Agent handling volume grows → propose scaling package"
    - "New department wants what first department has"
    - "Client's industry has new regulation → propose compliance automation"
  
  churn_warning_signs:
    - "Skipping check-in calls"
    - "Slow to respond to emails"
    - "Questioning invoices"
    - "Asking about contract end dates"
    - "New internal hire in AI/automation"
```

### QBR Template

```yaml
qbr:
  duration: "45-60 minutes"
  agenda:
    - "Performance Review (15 min)"
      # Show: tickets handled, hours saved, errors prevented, ROI
    - "Wins & Learnings (10 min)"
      # What worked well, what we improved
    - "Roadmap Preview (15 min)"
      # What's possible next quarter (expansion opportunities)
    - "Strategic Discussion (15 min)"
      # Their business goals + how AI can accelerate them
  
  deliverable: "QBR summary document sent within 24 hours"
  rule: "Always end with a specific next-step proposal"
```

### The Expansion Playbook

```
Land: First project in one department ($5-25K)
  ↓
Expand: Retainer for ongoing optimization ($2-5K/mo)
  ↓  
Cross-sell: Same solution for adjacent department
  ↓
Upsell: Enterprise-wide AI strategy ($30-50K+)
  ↓
Partner: Annual AI operations contract ($100K+/year)
```

## Phase 10: Unit Economics & Financial Management

### Agency Unit Economics

```yaml
unit_economics:
  revenue_per_project:
    average: "$15,000"
    cost_of_delivery:
      your_time: "$3,000"  # 20 hours × $150/hr opportunity cost
      api_costs: "$200"    # LLM API during development
      tools: "$100"        # Pro rata share of monthly tools
      contractor: "$0"     # If solo
      total: "$3,300"
    gross_margin: "$11,700 (78%)"
  
  monthly_recurring:
    average_retainer: "$3,000/mo"
    cost_to_service: "$500/mo"  # 3-4 hours/month
    margin: "$2,500/mo (83%)"
  
  target_metrics:
    gross_margin: ">70%"
    net_margin: ">50%"
    revenue_per_employee: ">$200K/year"
    ltv_per_client: ">$30K"
    cac: "<$2,000"
    ltv_cac_ratio: ">15:1"
```

### Monthly P&L Template

```yaml
monthly_pnl:
  revenue:
    project_revenue: 0
    retainer_revenue: 0
    consulting_revenue: 0
    total_revenue: 0
  
  cost_of_delivery:

    software: 0   # CRM, project mgmt, etc.
    insurance: 0
    legal_accounting: 0
    education: 0  # Courses, conferences
    misc: 0
    total_opex: 0
  
  net_profit: 0  # Gross profit - OpEx
  net_margin_pct: 0
  
  targets:
    gross_margin: ">70%"
    net_margin: ">40%"
    monthly_growth: ">10%"
```

### Cash Flow Rules

1. **50% upfront, 50% on delivery** — non-negotiable for projects under $25K
2. **Monthly retainers billed in advance** — net 0, not net 30
3. **Enterprise (>$25K):** 40/30/30 at milestones
4. **Never start work without payment** — "We'll pay after" = they won't pay
5. **3-month cash reserve minimum** — covers dry pipeline months
6. **API costs are pass-through** — bill client directly or markup 20%

---

## Phase 11: Scaling Playbook

### Growth Stages

| Stage | Revenue | Team | Focus |
|-------|---------|------|-------|
| **Solo** | $0-$15K/mo | Just you | Find product-market fit, build case studies |
| **Micro** | $15-$40K/mo | You + 1-2 contractors | Systematize delivery, build pipeline |
| **Small Agency** | $40-$100K/mo | 3-5 people | Delegate delivery, focus on sales & strategy |
| **Growth Agency** | $100K-$300K/mo | 6-15 people | Hire managers, build departments |
| **Scale** | $300K+/mo | 15+ | Platform/product layer, M&A opportunities |

### First Hire Decision Tree

```
If delivery is the bottleneck → Hire a technical implementer
If pipeline is the bottleneck → Hire a sales/marketing person  
If admin is the bottleneck → Hire a VA/ops person

RULE: Your first hire should free up YOUR highest-value activity.
Most agency founders should stay in sales and hire delivery.
```

### Delegation Framework

```yaml
delegation:
  never_delegate:
    - "Client relationship (discovery calls, QBRs)"
    - "Pricing decisions"
    - "Strategic direction"
    - "Quality standards definition"
  
  delegate_first:
    - "Routine implementation work"
    - "Documentation and training materials"
    - "Monitoring and maintenance"
    - "Administrative tasks (invoicing, scheduling)"
    - "Content creation (with your frameworks)"
  
  delegate_later:
    - "Sales calls (after documenting your process)"
    - "Client communication (after training)"
    - "Architecture decisions (after building playbooks)"
```

### Content Marketing for Agencies

```yaml

## Phase 12: Positioning & Differentiation

### Niche Selection Framework

**The riches are in the niches.** "AI automation agency" is not a niche. These are:

| Niche | Market Size | Competition | Example Positioning |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| AI for law firms | $330B legal market | Low | "We automate legal document review — 90% faster" |
| AI for healthcare ops | $4.5T healthcare | Medium | "Patient intake automation for multi-location clinics" |
| AI for real estate | $380B real estate | Low | "AI-powered property management operations" |
| AI for e-commerce | $6.3T e-commerce | High | "AI customer service for Shopify stores doing $1M+" |
| AI for recruiting | $500B HR market | Medium | "Automated candidate screening for tech companies" |
| AI for finance ops | $26T financial services | Medium | "Invoice processing automation for mid-market companies" |
| AI for construction | $13T construction | Very Low | "AI bid estimation and document processing" |
| AI for SaaS companies | $200B SaaS market | High | "AI-powered customer success for B2B SaaS" |

### Positioning Statement Template

```
We help [specific type of company] [achieve specific outcome] 
using AI automation, so they can [ultimate benefit].

Unlike [alternative], we [key differentiator].
```

**Example:**
"We help mid-market law firms automate document review and client intake, 
so partners can focus on billable work instead of admin.
Unlike general AI consultants, we've built 20+ legal automation systems 
and guarantee results in Week 1."

### Differentiation Strategies

1. **Speed** — "Operational in 7 days, not 7 months"
2. **Specialization** — "We only do [niche]. We've done it 50+ times."
3. **Guarantee** — "If you don't save [X hours] in 30 days, we refund your setup fee"
4. **Methodology** — "Our RAPID framework delivers predictable results"
5. **Proof** — "Average client ROI: 12x in Year 1 (backed by case studies)"

## Quality Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Dimension | Weight | 0-25 (Critical) | 50 (Developing) | 75 (Good) | 100 (Excellent) |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Service Definition** | 15% | No defined packages | Basic services listed | Clear packages with pricing | Productized with case studies per service |
| **Sales Process** | 15% | No pipeline | Ad hoc sales | Documented funnel, scripts | Repeatable system, tracked metrics |
| **Delivery Quality** | 20% | Chaotic, missed deadlines | Projects complete but messy | RAPID framework, consistent | Clients rave, referrals flow |
| **Financial Health** | 15% | Losing money | Breaking even | Profitable, some runway | 70%+ margins, 6mo+ runway |
| **Client Retention** | 15% | One-off projects only | Some repeat work | 60%+ retain or expand | 80%+ NRR, systematic expansion |
| **Positioning** | 10% | "We do AI" | Some niche focus | Clear niche, some proof | Category leader in niche |
| **Operations** | 10% | Everything manual | Some templates | Documented SOPs | Systemized, runs without founder |

**Scoring:** 0-40 = Pre-revenue / broken fundamentals | 41-60 = Growing but fragile | 61-80 = Healthy agency | 81-100 = Scale-ready

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Pricing too low | Calculate client ROI, price at 10-20% of value |
| No niche | Pick ONE industry, dominate it, then expand |
| Building before selling | Sell first, build second. Pre-sell with mockups |
| Over-engineering | MVP in 1 week, iterate based on real usage |
| No case studies | Document EVERY project's results, even small wins |
| Handshake deals | MSA + SOW or no work starts. Period. |
| Doing everything yourself | First hire should free your highest-value time |
| Ignoring retention | Existing clients are 5x cheaper than new ones |
| No content marketing | 2 LinkedIn posts/week minimum — compound effect |
| Chasing every lead | Qualify ruthlessly — say no to bad-fit clients |

## Edge Cases

### Solo Technical Founder
- Start with DFY projects to fund operations
- Productize within 3 months
- Hire sales/marketing before more developers
- Your technical skill is the moat — don't let it become the bottleneck

### Non-Technical Founder
- Partner with a technical co-founder (equity) or hire senior dev (contract)
- Focus on sales, positioning, and client relationships
- Use no-code/low-code tools (n8n, Make) for simpler projects
- Don't oversell technical capabilities you can't deliver

### Transitioning from Freelance
- Raise prices 2x immediately (you're an agency now)
- Productize your most-repeated freelance project
- Build SOPs for everything you do repeatedly
- Stop taking projects under $5K

### Enterprise Sales
- Longer sales cycle (3-6 months) — plan cash flow accordingly
- Need case studies, security certifications, insurance proof
- Multiple stakeholders — identify champion + decision maker
- Start with pilot ($20-50K) → expand to enterprise deal ($200K+)
- Procurement departments require specific legal language — have a lawyer review

### Recession/Downturn
- Double down on "save money" positioning (not "grow revenue")
- Offer smaller packages ($3-5K quick wins)
- Focus on retention over acquisition
- Automation becomes MORE valuable when companies cut headcount
