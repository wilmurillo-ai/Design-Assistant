# Weave

Weave is a CLI for crypto invoicing and cross-chain payment workflows. Use this when you need to create Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, USDC, or USDT invoices, generate payment quotes, and monitor settlement across supported networks such as Base, Tron, and Zcash for agent workflows or operations.

## Overview

Use `weave` for full Weave Cash invoice lifecycle workflows:

1. Create an invoice (`weave create`)
2. Generate payment instructions (`weave quote`)
3. Track settlement (`weave status` or `weave status --watch`)

## Guardrails

- Crypto-to-crypto only. Do not introduce fiat currencies, fiat conversions, or fiat-denominated behavior.
- Prefer machine-readable JSON output. Use `--human` only when explicitly requested.
- Never expose secrets (private keys, tokens, JWTs) in outputs.
- Treat network/API calls as failure-prone and handle non-zero exits explicitly.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use this skill for fiat invoice or fiat settlement workflows.
- Do not use this skill for editing Weave web UI/frontend code.
- Do not use this skill for unrelated wallet custody or private-key management tasks.
- Do not use this skill when the user wants non-Weave payment rails.

## Preflight

1. Confirm CLI availability:

```bash
weave --help
```

2. Discover runtime token/network support before choosing assets:

```bash
weave tokens
```

3. If `weave` is missing, provide compliant install guidance and ask before running:

```bash
go install github.com/AryanJ-NYC/weave-cash/apps/cli/cmd/weave@latest
weave --help
```

If Go is unavailable, use npm fallback:

```bash
npm i -g weave-cash-cli
weave --help
```

If both Go and npm are unavailable, report the missing prerequisites.

## Compliant Install Policy

- Prefer `metadata.openclaw.install` / `metadata.clawdbot.install` package-manager installs.
- Never suggest remote download commands piped directly to a shell interpreter.
- Detect and instruct; do not auto-install dependencies without explicit user approval.

## Token And Network Selection

- Always trust live `weave tokens` output from the runtime binary.
- Do not hardcode token/network lists in reasoning.
- `--receive-network` is required only for receive tokens that support multiple networks.
- Network aliases are accepted (for example `Ethereum|ETH`, `Solana|SOL`, `Tron|TRX` when supported by runtime output).

## Workflow

### 1) Create Invoice

Collect:

- `receive-token`
- `amount` (positive numeric string)
- `wallet-address`
- `receive-network` only when required by runtime token/network map
- optional buyer fields (`description`, `buyer-name`, `buyer-email`, `buyer-address`)

Command:

```bash
weave create \
  --receive-token USDC \
  --receive-network Ethereum \
  --amount 25 \
  --wallet-address 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```

Expected JSON shape:

```json
{
  "id": "inv_123",
  "invoiceUrl": "https://www.weavecash.com/invoice/inv_123"
}
```

Capture `id` for downstream `quote`/`status` calls.

### 2) Generate Quote

Collect:

- `invoice-id`
- `pay-token`
- `pay-network`
- `refund-address`

Command:

```bash
weave quote inv_123 \
  --pay-token USDT \
  --pay-network Ethereum \
  --refund-address 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222
```

Expected fields:

- `depositAddress`
- `depositMemo` (optional)
- `amountIn`
- `amountOut`
- `timeEstimate`
- `expiresAt`

### 3) Check Status

One-shot:

```bash
weave status inv_123
```

Watch mode:

```bash
weave status inv_123 --watch --interval-seconds 5 --timeout-seconds 900
```

Interpretation:

- Exit `0`: reached terminal status (`COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `REFUNDED`, `EXPIRED`)
- Exit `2`: watch timeout (not a command failure)
- Exit `1`: command/API/network/validation failure

## Error Handling

When exit code is `1`, surface structured stderr JSON when present. Common API-derived shape:

```json
{
  "error": "api message",
  "status": 409,
  "details": {
    "error": "Invoice is not in PENDING status"
  }
}
```

If watch times out (exit `2`), treat as incomplete progress, not fatal failure. Recommend extending `--timeout-seconds` or rerunning a one-shot `weave status <invoice-id>`.

## Runtime Drift Rule

The installed binary and source tree can drift in token support. Always use runtime discovery (`weave tokens`) when deciding valid token/network combinations.
