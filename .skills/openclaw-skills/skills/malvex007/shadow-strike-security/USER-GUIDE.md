## Quick Start

### Your First Commands

Try these to get started:

```bash
"scan localhost"              → Safe test on your own system
"services localhost"          → Check what services are running
"web example.com"             → Web app fingerprinting (authorized)
```

### Understanding Results

**Port Scan Example:**
```
You: "scan target.com"
ShadowStrike: "Ports: 22(SSH),80(HTTP),443(HTTPS)"

What this means:
• Port 22: SSH service running (remote access)
• Port 80: HTTP web server (unencrypted)
• Port 443: HTTPS web server (encrypted)
```

**Web Test Example:**
```
You: "web target.com"
ShadowStrike: 
  "Technology: Apache/2.4, PHP/7.4, WordPress
   Directories: /admin, /wp-content, /api
   Vulnerabilities: SQLi (critical), XSS (high)
   Report: ./target-security-report.md"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Tool not found"

**Problem:** ShadowStrike can't find required tools

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Kali tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nmap nikto sqlmap hashcat aircrack-ng

# Or install complete Kali
sudo apt-get install kali-linux-headless
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"

**Problem:** Can't run privileged commands

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run with sudo
sudo openclaw command

# Or add to sudoers
sudo usermod -aG sudo $USER
```

### Issue: "Scan too slow"

**Problem:** Scanning is taking too long

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use quick scan
"quick target.com"

# Limit port range
"scan ports 1-1000 target.com"

# Use aggressive timing
"scan -T5 target.com"
```

### Issue: "False positives"

**Problem:** Getting too many false positive results

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify findings manually
"verify target.com"

# Adjust scan sensitivity
"scan --safe target.com"

# Use multiple tools for confirmation
```

### Issue: "Skill not loading"

**Problem:** ShadowStrike not appearing in skills list

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check installation
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/shadowstrike-security/

# Reinstall if needed
cp -r shadowstrike-security ~/.openclaw/skills/
pkill -f "openclaw gateway"
openclaw gateway &

# Verify
openclaw skills list | grep shadowstrike
```
