# NeuroCore AI

**The Intelligent Brain for OpenClaw**

Transform your OpenClaw into a self-aware, autonomous intelligence that thinks, monitors, and optimizes your system automatically.

## What is NeuroCore?

NeuroCore AI is an advanced cognitive layer for OpenClaw that provides:
- **Autonomous Intelligence** - Thinks proactively without prompting
- **Self-Healing Systems** - Fixes issues before they become problems
- **Cost Optimization** - Saves 60-80% on API costs
- **24/7 Monitoring** - Watches your system continuously

## Key Features

### 🧠 Cognitive Engine
- Anticipates your needs before you ask
- Learns from your patterns and preferences
- Makes intelligent decisions automatically
- Completes complex workflows autonomously

### 🔧 Auto-Healing
- **Disk Guardian:** Auto-cleans when >85% full
- **Memory Optimizer:** Clears cache at >90% usage
- **Service Doctor:** Restarts failed services
- **Process Manager:** Kills zombie processes

### 💰 Smart Economics
- Ultra-concise responses (<100 tokens)
- Intelligent caching (5-30 min TTL)
- Batch operations for efficiency
- **Save up to $500/month** on API costs

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
cp -r neurocore-ai ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

Add to `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent.json`:
```json
{
  "skills": ["neurocore-ai"]
}
```

Restart OpenClaw:
```bash
pkill -f "openclaw gateway" && openclaw gateway &
```

### First Commands
```
"status"      → CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%
"optimize"    → System optimized
"services"    → nginx✓ mysql✓ ssh✓
"fix"         → Issues resolved
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Description | Example Output |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `status` | System overview | `✓ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%` |
| `cpu` | CPU usage | `CPU: 23%` |
| `memory` | Memory stats | `Mem: 4.2G/8G (52%)` |
| `disk` | Disk usage | `Disk: 67% (45G/67G)` |
| `services` | Service status | `nginx✓ mysql✓ ssh✓` |
| `fix` | Auto-fix issues | `⚠ Fixed: cleared 2GB` |
| `clean` | Clear cache | `✓ Cache cleared` |
| `optimize` | Optimize system | `✓ System optimized` |

## How It Works

### Traditional Assistant
```
You: "Can you please check my system status?"
AI: "I'd be happy to help! Let me check your CPU, memory..."
[20 seconds]
AI: "Here are your system stats..."
[105 tokens, $0.21]
```

### NeuroCore AI
```
You: "status"
AI: "✓ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"
[16 tokens, $0.032]
```

**95% more efficient!**

## Auto-Healing in Action

**Scenario: Disk Space Critical**
```
[System Disk: 92% full]
NeuroCore: [Auto-deletes 5GB temp files]
You see: "⚠ Auto-resolved: Freed 5GB disk space"
```

**Scenario: Memory Pressure**
```
[System Memory: 94% used]
NeuroCore: [Clears cache silently]
Result: Memory optimized to 72%
```

**Scenario: Service Failure**
```
[nginx service crashed]
NeuroCore: [Detected & restarted in 3 seconds]
You see: "⚠ Auto-recovered: nginx restarted"
```

## Symbol Language

NeuroCore uses intelligent symbols for instant communication:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| ✓ | Success | `✓ All systems optimal` |
| ✗ | Error | `✗ Service failed` |
| ⚠ | Auto-fixed | `⚠ Resolved: 3 issues` |
| → | Processing | `→ Optimizing...` |
| 💡 | Insight | `💡 Tip: Clear logs` |

## Monitoring Dashboard

NeuroCore monitors continuously:

**Every 5 Minutes:**
- Disk space usage
- Memory consumption
- System load
- Service health
- Zombie processes

**Every 60 Seconds:**
- Critical log errors
- Authentication failures
- High CPU processes
- Network anomalies

## Cost Analysis

**Daily Usage (100 requests):**
- Traditional: 10,500 tokens ($21.00)
- NeuroCore: 1,600 tokens ($3.20)
- **Daily Savings: $17.80**

**Monthly Savings:**
- **$534/month** for heavy users
- **$178/month** for average users
- **$53/month** for light users

## Requirements

- OpenClaw >= 2026.2.3
- Linux-based system
- Bash 4.0+
- 512MB RAM minimum
