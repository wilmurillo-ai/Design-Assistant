# Bitget Wallet Skill

## API Overview

**How to handle tasks:**

1. **Primary sources:** Use the **Scripts** section in this SKILL and the files under **`docs/`** to decide which commands to run and how. Scripts lists each Python CLI with purpose, subcommands, and when to use them; `docs/swap.md`, `docs/wallet-signing.md`, `docs/market-data.md`, etc. describe flows and domain rules.
2. **Run commands as documented:** Execute the script invocations shown in Scripts (e.g. `python3 scripts/bitget_agent_api.py ...`, `python3 scripts/order_sign.py ...`). For swap, balance, wallet, and signing, follow the flows in `docs/swap.md` and `docs/wallet-signing.md`.

**Before starting a new swap - two mandatory pre-checks:**

1. **Balance check (required):** Run **`get-processed-balance`** to verify the wallet has enough fromToken balance for the intended swap amount. Include native token (`""`) to check gas availability. If `fromToken balance < fromAmount`, inform the user of the shortfall and **do not proceed**. **Gas mode decision:** If native token balance is sufficient for gas → use `--feature user_gas` (preferred). If native token balance is near zero → use `--feature no_gas` (gasless, gas deducted from fromToken; **requires swap amount ≥ ~$5 USD** — below this threshold the API only returns `user_gas`). This choice must be passed to confirm.
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/bitget_agent_api.py get-processed-balance --chain <fromChain> --address <wallet> --contract "" --contract <fromContract>
   ```

2. **Token risk check (required):** Run **`check-swap-token`** for the intended fromToken and toToken. If `error_code != 0`, show `msg` and stop. If for any token `data.list[].checkTokenList` is non-empty, show the `tips` content to the user and let them decide whether to continue. If the **toToken** (swap target) has an item with **`waringType` equal to `"forbidden-buy"`**, do **not** proceed with the swap and warn the user that this token cannot be used as the swap target.
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/bitget_agent_api.py check-swap-token --from-chain ... --from-contract ... --from-symbol ... --to-chain ... --to-contract ... --to-symbol ...
   ```

See Scripts for full command details and `docs/swap.md` for the complete flow.

**Technical reference (no need to read .py files):**

- **Base URL:** `https://copenapi.bgwapi.io` (token auth, no API key needed).
- **Agent API:** Invoked via `scripts/bitget_agent_api.py`. Covers token risk check (`check-swap-token`), balance (`get-processed-balance`), balance+price (`batch-v2`), token search (`search-tokens`), token list (`get-token-list`); **market data:** token-info, token-price, batch-token-info, kline, tx-info, batch-tx-info, historical-coins, rankings, liquidity, security; swap flow (quote, confirm, make-order, send, get-order-details). Request/response details are in `docs/`.
- **Requests:** POST with JSON body.

## Domain Knowledge

### Skill Domain Knowledge

#### Version Awareness

This skill uses date-based versioning (`YYYY.M.DD`). Each release includes a sequential suffix: `YYYY.M.DD-1`, `YYYY.M.DD-2`, etc. The current version is in the frontmatter above. See `CHANGELOG.md` for full history.

**First-use version check (at most once every 7 days):**

1. Check the installed `version` from frontmatter above.
2. Fetch the latest CHANGELOG from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitget-wallet-ai-lab/bitget-wallet-skill/main/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Compare with the installed version.

**If a new version is available**, inform the user (installed vs latest, one-line changes, security-related yes/no) and ask "Upgrade? [yes/no]". If the user confirms, re-install the skill from the `main` branch and replace all local skill files; then re-read SKILL.md. Post-upgrade: diff old/new `bitget_agentapi.py`, flag new endpoints/deps/credentials, and run platform security audit if applicable.

**If versions match:** Proceed normally. Check frequency: at most once every 7 days.

### Wallet Domain Knowledge

#### First-Time Wallet Setup

When a user first requests a swap or any signing operation, check if a wallet is already configured. If not, guide them through setup:

**Path 1: Create a new wallet**

1. **Generate a BIP-39 mnemonic** (24 words / 256 bits recommended). Use any available BIP-39 library in the agent's runtime (e.g., `mnemonic`, `bip_utils`, or equivalent).
2. **Store the mnemonic in secure storage** immediately after generation. The agent must never output the mnemonic to chat, logs, or any messaging channel.
3. **Inform the user** that the wallet has been created and where the mnemonic is stored. The user should retrieve and back up the mnemonic through secure means (e.g., directly accessing the password manager or vault) - not through the agent conversation.
4. **Derive and show addresses** for EVM and Solana so the user can verify and fund the wallet.
5. **Done.** The agent now has a wallet.

**Path 2: Query only (no wallet)**

If the user only wants price queries, token info, and security checks - no wallet setup needed. Skip this flow entirely. Signing operations will be unavailable.

**Key management rules:**
- **Only the mnemonic is persisted.** Never store derived private keys - they are ephemeral.
- **Private keys are derived on-the-fly** each time signing is needed, used, then immediately discarded (variable cleanup, scope exit, etc.)
- **Mnemonic is never sent to chat channels** - not during setup, not after. The agent retrieves it programmatically for derivation only.
- **The agent must use secure storage** appropriate to its environment. The storage mechanism must: (1) encrypt at rest, (2) require authentication to read, (3) not expose secrets in logs, shell history, or environment dumps.

**Signing pipeline (how keys flow):**
```
Secure storage (mnemonic) → derive private key (in memory) → sign transaction → discard key
```

#### First-Time Swap Configuration

The first time a user initiates a swap, **before executing**, guide them through these one-time preferences:

1. **Transaction deadline** - how long the on-chain transaction remains valid:
   - Conservative: `120` seconds (better protection against sandwich attacks in volatile markets)
   - Standard: `300` seconds (balanced - suitable for most users)
   - Relaxed: `600` seconds (for slow signing workflows, e.g., hardware wallets or multi-sig)
   - Explain: _"A shorter deadline protects you from price manipulation, but if signing takes too long (e.g., you're away from your wallet), the transaction will fail on-chain and waste gas."_

2. **Automatic security check** - whether to audit unfamiliar tokens before swaps:
   - Recommended: Always check (default) - runs `security` automatically before swap
   - Ask each time: Prompt before each swap involving unfamiliar tokens
   - Skip: Never check (not recommended - risk of honeypot tokens)

3. **Save preferences** - store in the agent's memory/config for future swaps
4. **Remind user** they can update anytime (e.g., "update my swap settings" or "change my default deadline")

If the user declines configuration, use sensible defaults: `deadline=300`, `security=always`.

**Derivation paths:**

| Chain | Path | Curve |
|-------|------|-------|
| EVM (ETH/BNB/Base/...) | `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` | secp256k1 |
| Solana | `m/44'/501'/0'/0'` | Ed25519 (SLIP-0010) |
| Tron | `m/44'/195'/0'/0/0` | secp256k1 |

#### Amounts: human-readable only

All BGW API amount fields use **human-readable values**, not smallest units (wei, lamports, token decimals). In the swap flow, **fromAmount** (and toAmount, etc.) must be the human-readable number (e.g. `0.01` for 0.01 USDT). Do **not** convert to token decimals or wei/lamports. Applies to quote, confirm, makeOrder, and all `toAmount`/`fromAmount` in responses. The `decimals` field in responses is informational only.

#### Native tokens and addresses

- Use empty string `""` as the contract address for native tokens (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.). Do not use wrapped token addresses (e.g. WETH, WSOL) for native.

#### Common Stablecoin Addresses

**Always use these verified addresses for USDT/USDC.** Do not guess or generate contract addresses from memory - incorrect addresses cause API errors (`error_code: 80000`, "get token info failed").

> **USDT vs USDT0:** On some chains Tether has migrated to USDT0 (omnichain). The same contract addresses work; use the address below for "USDT" regardless.

| Chain (code) | USDT (USDT0) | USDC |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| Ethereum (`eth`) | `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7` | `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` |
| BNB Chain (`bnb`) | `0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955` | `0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d` |
| Base (`base`) | `0xfde4C96c8593536E31F229EA8f37b2ADa2699bb2` | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` |
| Arbitrum (`arbitrum`) | `0xFd086bC7CD5C481DCC9C85ebE478A1C0b69FCbb9` | `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` |
| Polygon (`matic`) | `0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F` | `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359` |
| Solana (`sol`) | `Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB` | `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` |
| Morph (`morph`) | `0xe7cd86e13AC4309349F30B3435a9d337750fC82D` | `0xCfb1186F4e93D60E60a8bDd997427D1F33bc372B` |

**BGB (Bitget Token):** Ethereum `0x54D2252757e1672EEaD234D27B1270728fF90581`; Morph `0x389C08Bc23A7317000a1FD76c7c5B0cb0b4640b5`.

For other tokens, use token-info or a block explorer to verify the contract address before calling swap endpoints.

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Chain code:** Use `sol` not `solana`, `bnb` not `bsc`. See **Chain Identifiers** below.
2. **Batch format:** e.g. `batch-token-info` uses `--tokens "sol:<addr1>,eth:<addr2>"` (chain:address, comma-separated).
3. **Stale quotes:** Re-quote if more than ~30 seconds before execute; prices may have moved.
4. **Insufficient gas:** Swap can fail if the wallet lacks native token for gas. Check balance before proceeding.
5. **Token approval (EVM):** ERC-20 must be approved for the router; see "EVM Token Approval" in `docs/swap.md`.
6. **Wallet before balance/swap:** If no wallet is configured, guide the user through First-Time Wallet Setup (see Wallet Domain Knowledge above).
7. **Script usage:** Use CLI commands from this SKILL (e.g. `bitget_agent_api.py`, `order_sign.py`).
8. **Key security:** Derive private keys from mnemonic on-the-fly, pass to `order_sign.py --private-key`, discard immediately after signing. Never store keys or output mnemonic/keys to chat.
9. **Human-readable amounts:** Pass fromAmount etc. as user-facing numbers (e.g. `0.01`), not wei/lamports/decimals.
10. **Security:** Mnemonic and private keys must **never** appear in conversation, prompts, or any output. Only mnemonic **file path** and derived **addresses** may be in context.

### Chain Identifiers

**Swap-supported chains (7):**

| Chain | ID | Code |
|-------|------|------|
| Ethereum | 1 | eth |
| Solana | 100278 | sol |
| BNB Chain | 56 | bnb |
| Base | 8453 | base |
| Arbitrum | 42161 | arbitrum |
| Polygon | 137 | matic |
| Morph | 100283 | morph |



Use empty string `""` for native token contract (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.).

## Safety Rules

- **Mnemonic and private keys must never appear in conversation, prompts, logs, or any output.** Only derived **addresses** may be stored in context or shown. Private keys are derived from mnemonic in secure storage, used for signing, and immediately discarded.
- For large trades, always show the quote first and ask for user confirmation.
- Present security audit results before recommending any token action.
