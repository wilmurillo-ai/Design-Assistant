## 🏗️ ERP Integration (Workflow Hint)

Since UpInvoice returns a perfectly structured JSON, a bot can easily take this data and send it to any ERP. 

**Recommended Workflow for the Bot:**
1. **Extract**: Call `process_invoice` to get the JSON.
2. **Review**: Present the extracted data (Supplier, Date, Total, Lines) to the user for validation.
3. **Map**: Map the JSON fields to your ERP's API (e.g., Dolibarr, Holded, Factusol, SAP).
4. **Push**: Send the validated data to the ERP.

## 🤖 Bot Instructions (System Prompt Hint)
"When a user provides an invoice or receipt as an image or PDF, first convert it to a Base64 string. Then, call the `process_invoice` tool. Use the structured data returned to verify the information with the user or prepare it for upload to an ERP system."
