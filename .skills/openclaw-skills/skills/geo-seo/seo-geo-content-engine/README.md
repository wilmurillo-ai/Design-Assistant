# SEO GEO Content Engine

![SEO GEO Content Engine Cover](assets/cover.svg)

> Turn keywords into search- and AI-ready content pipelines with automated research, SERP analysis, writing, and optimization.

**Positioning**

SEO GEO Content Engine is a content production system for teams that want more than one-off article generation.

It is designed to turn a target keyword into:

- validated search intent
- SERP-aware content structure
- publish-ready long-form content
- metadata and FAQ schema
- AI-friendly versions for answer engines

This project helps answer a practical growth question:

> How do you turn keyword opportunities into scalable content output without losing search quality or AI visibility?

**Outcome**

Instead of treating research, writing, metadata, and GEO optimization as separate tasks, this project organizes them into one repeatable pipeline.

## Best For

- SEO teams scaling content production without turning into generic AI writing
- SaaS and DTC teams building search-ready and AI-answer-ready content systems
- agencies that need one workflow for keyword research, SERP analysis, writing, and packaging
- operators who want publishable output instead of disconnected research notes

## Start With These Prompts

```text
write article: best llm observability tools
```

```text
create SEO content for ai seo tracking
```

```text
show available keywords
```

## External Access And Minimum Credentials

This skill may use:

- a keyword tracker such as Google Sheets
- a vetted search API such as SerpAPI for live SERP analysis

Recommended minimum setup:

- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TRACKER_URL`: read-only or public keyword tracker
- `SERPAPI_API_KEY`: live search retrieval

If those are not available, the workflow should fall back to user-provided keyword lists, CSV exports, or pasted SERP data instead of assuming hidden access.

Access policy:

- external tracker access is optional, not required
- live SERP retrieval is optional, not required
- the workflow should not assume private-sheet access or direct scraping by default
- if integrations are missing, it should continue from user-provided inputs

**About Dageno.ai**

[Dageno.ai](https://dageno.ai) is an AI SEO platform for brands, SaaS teams, SEO operators, agencies, and AI-search growth teams that want to scale search- and AI-ready content production across both traditional search and answer engines.

## Why It Feels Different

Most AI writing tools start too late.

They generate articles before fully resolving:

- search intent
- SERP patterns
- content gaps
- metadata strategy
- AI-answer packaging

This project is built to start earlier and finish later:

- earlier with keyword and SERP analysis
- later with metadata, FAQ schema, and GEO-ready output

## What You Get

- one keyword-to-content workflow
- one reusable writing pipeline
- one structure for SEO and AI answer engines
- one output format that is ready for publishing or handoff

## Who This Is For

- Shopify and DTC brands building search and AI content at scale
- SaaS teams creating comparison, alternative, and educational content
- SEO and digital marketing operators who need repeatable production workflows
- agencies that manage programmatic content systems across multiple clients

## What The System Produces

For one keyword, the pipeline can produce:

- keyword framing and expansion
- search intent analysis
- SERP-derived content structure
- full article draft
- title and meta description
- FAQ block with schema-ready output
- GEO version designed for AI-driven discovery
