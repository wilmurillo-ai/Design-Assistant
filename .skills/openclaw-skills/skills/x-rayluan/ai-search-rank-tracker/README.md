# What it tracks

• Whether your brand is mentioned  
• Ranking position in AI answers  
• Competitors mentioned alongside your brand  
• Sentiment (positive / neutral / negative)

If your product is not recommended in AI answers,  
you are invisible to those users.

• Where your startup appears  
• Which prompts trigger recommendations  
• Which competitors replace you
