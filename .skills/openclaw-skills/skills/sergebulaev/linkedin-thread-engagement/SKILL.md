# LinkedIn Thread Engagement

The engagement compounding layer. Tracks which of the user's comments earned author replies, drafts timely follow-ups, and flags the 6-24 hour window where thread momentum is highest.

## When to use

- Daily: "What threads need follow-up today?"
- After posting a batch of comments: "Check back in 6 hours"
- When an author replied personally (e.g., Kevin Payne → Serge): "Draft the response"

## Input

- User's LinkedIn profile URL (to pull their recent comments)
- Optional: specific post URL to monitor

## Output

### Daily report

| Posted | Author | Post | Comment | Reply? | Stage | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 18h ago | Kevin Payne | LawVu | "moat moved to taste" | ✅ Kevin replied 14h ago | Warm (6-24h window) | **Reply now** |
| 22h ago | Dharmesh Shah | HubSpot | "integration depth moat" | No | Cold | Skip |
| 3h ago | Felix T. | Rezolve | "twin economies" | No | Watch | Check in 3h |

### For each warm thread
- Thread preview (last 3 turns)
- Suggested response (drafted via `linkedin-reply-handler`)
- Reaction target (the specific reply URN, not the post)
- Priority (high / medium / low)

### Weekly roll-up
- Total comments posted
- Author-reply rate (target: 15%+)
- Conversion to DM (when thread closes warm)

## Steps

1. **Fetch user's recent comments** via HarvestAPI `/linkedin/profile-comments`.
2. **For each comment posted in last 72h:** fetch the parent post's comment tree and look for:
   - Replies to the user's comment
   - Whether the author posted any of those replies
   - Timestamps (time since user's comment, time since latest reply)
3. **Classify stage:**
   - **Hot (<6h):** author just replied — respond within 90 min for max thread momentum
   - **Warm (6-24h):** the Kevin Payne window — author replies most happen here
   - **Cool (24-72h):** still respondable but lower velocity
   - **Dormant (>72h):** don't reply in thread; consider DM
4. **Draft responses** for warm threads using `linkedin-reply-handler` (which adapts to the active backend per `lib.active_backend()` — Publora auto-posts, manual mode returns copy-paste, DIY invokes custom poster).
5. **Flag suspicious patterns:**
   - Author replied but also deleted someone else's comment (author is actively moderating, tread carefully)
   - Commenter is in thread self-promoting (your reply shouldn't engage them)
6. **DM routing:** if thread is dormant but the author engaged meaningfully, draft a DM that references the thread specifically.

## Kevin Payne window

Named after the real 2026-04 data point: Kevin Payne (LawVu CEO) replied to Serge's comment 22h after the original post. This is the sweet spot.

- **0-6h:** 70% of author replies happen here if they're going to happen
- **6-24h:** ~25% of author replies, but these are higher-quality (author took time to think)
- **>24h:** thread rarely produces new author engagement

**Follow-up timing:**
- If author replied in 0-6h window: respond within 90 minutes
- If author replied in 6-24h window: respond within 2 hours (they're still checking)
- If author replied >24h: respond within 4 hours before thread goes cold

## Inbound-quality signals

High-quality commenter = worth the follow-up:
- Founder/operator title in profile
- Company in user's ICP
- Active posting history (not just reactions)
- Mutual 2nd-degree connections >10
- Prior thoughtful comments on user's posts

Low-quality = skip:
- Generic praise with no specifics
- Template language ("I'd love to hop on a quick call")
- Profile is sales/agency with no operator history
- Same comment across many creators' posts

## Hard rules

- Never reply to a reply later than 72h after the thread's last turn. Switch to DM.
- Never chain 3+ replies under one comment (thread spam).
- If the author deleted their reply, do not reply — they reconsidered.
- Don't DM a warm thread before first replying publicly (skips a step).

## Example

> Input: monitor sbulaev profile, last 24h

> Output:
> - **1 warm thread:** Kevin Payne replied 14h ago on LawVu post. Current stage: Warm (8-24h). Suggested response ready. Action: post within 2 hours.
> - 8 cold threads (no author engagement). Skip.
> - 3 watching threads (<6h old, author may still reply). Check again in 3-6h.
