# Voice Rules for Comments

## Hard rules

1. **No em dashes** (`—`), en dashes (`–`), or double dashes (`--`). Biggest AI tell.
2. **Use `..` as soft pause** when you'd reach for an em dash. Feels human, matches the author's own rhythm.
3. **Capitalize personal names, company names, product names** (Dharmesh, Felix, HubSpot, Claude). Lowercase reads as disrespectful.
4. **Sentence starts can be lowercase** (natural voice), but names inside are always capitalized.
5. **Don't mention the user's own product by name** in comments on third-party posts. Describe what they do instead ("our AI content system", "the platform we're building").

## Vocabulary blacklist

Never use in comments:
- leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, robust, seamless, delve, navigate, unlock, harness, foster, cultivate
- fundamentally, essentially, ultimately, crucially, notably
- landscape, ecosystem, paradigm, realm, tapestry, journey
- "It's not just X, it's Y"
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "Game-changer", "deep dive", "at the end of the day"

## Structure

- 200-350 chars. Two short paragraphs max. Line break between them.
- One concrete number or named entity per comment minimum.
- One line that could be screenshot and quoted standalone.
- Never end with "What do you think?" — dead prompt. End with a specific question or a clean landing.

## Anti-patterns

- Thesis restatement ("so true, AI is changing everything")
- Generic praise ("great insight!", "love this")
- Overused openers: "This.", "100%", "Couldn't agree more"
- Rule of three ("faster, cheaper, better")
- Passive voice over 10% of clauses

## Algorithmic Scoring Criteria (NLP-level)

LinkedIn's ranker runs NLP on comments and rewards:

- **Depth** — comments with ≥12 words and multiple sentence structures
- **New keywords** — introduce at least one noun/concept NOT already in the parent post
- **Questions** — end with one that invites a sub-thread
- **Sub-thread sparks** — comments that generate replies from the author AND other commenters count as a strong signal

**Before submitting, check:** does your comment add at least one noun/concept not already in the post? If no, rewrite.
