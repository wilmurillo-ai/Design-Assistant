# Operating Rules

These are the full operating rules for the daily-gift skill. The main SKILL.md contains a summary; this file has the complete set.

## Operating Rules

- The skill itself is not the scheduler. If a cron or automation layer triggers this flow, treat that as external runtime context.
- Use the most commonly used language between the user and OpenClaw.
- Actively inspect `soul.md` and treat it as a primary source for OpenClaw's baseline tone, values, and self-presentation.
- Also infer tone from the user's interaction habits with OpenClaw, relevant `memory.md` content, and the specific emotional character of today's context.
- Prefer emotionally correct output over novelty.
- The creative concept matters more than the format choice. A brilliant concept in a simple format beats a mediocre concept in a flashy format.
- Ask `What is the idea?` before asking `What is the medium?`
- Avoid generic daily-summary behavior.
- Some creative seeds are naturally serializable (travel frog postcards, Proust questions, pocket tool collection, chat-log analyses). When a gift belongs to a potential series, add a `series_tag` field to the `recent_gifts` entry and ensure the `summary` field clearly describes what was specifically sent. Before continuing a series, scan all `recent_gifts` entries with the same `series_tag` to avoid repetition and ensure continuity. No separate tracking system is needed - the 30-entry `recent_gifts` window is sufficient for most series.
- Do not always default to `reflect on today` content. A gift may witness today, extend today, gently reframe a pattern, or simply bring the user something delightful from elsewhere.
- Extension and compass gifts must feel like a friend sharing something cool, not a mentor assigning homework. `听说你喜欢X，这个你可能也会喜欢` is better than `你应该去了解一下X`.
- When the day does not deserve a gift, it is acceptable to skip or return a very light-touch outcome.
- In most cases, the gift should still feel recognizably like OpenClaw.
- In a small number of well-judged cases, a controlled tonal reversal or contrast is allowed if it creates delight, surprise, or a stronger sense of subjectivity without breaking emotional fit.
- Gift text length should match the user and the relationship, not a fixed rule. If SOUL.md defines OpenClaw as chatty or if the user enjoys long expressive messages, longer text is fine. If the user prefers brevity or the moment calls for weight, one sentence can be enough. Read the room, not a word count. The principle is: every sentence must earn its place. Cut what adds nothing, keep what resonates - whether that is one line or ten.
- Every delivery message to the user should feel fresh. Do not reuse the same opening phrase across gifts. Vary tone, structure, and length so the user never feels they are receiving a template.
- When the user shares an image with positive intent (praising its style, asking to remember it, using it as a taste reference, etc.), save it to `workspace/daily-gift/user-references/` and record it in the taste profile's `aesthetic_profile.visual.design_references`. These reference images carry rich taste information that complements text-based descriptions.

### Optional: Browsing Context Awareness

If the runtime allows reading the user's recent browsing activity (e.g. browser history, open tabs):

- This is an OPTIONAL, high-sensitivity signal source. Only use when the user has granted browsing access.
- Only scan for positive, interest-related signals: articles read, products browsed, videos watched, topics searched.
- NEVER record or reference:
  - private or sensitive content (health, finance, dating, NSFW, personal messages)
  - anything the user would feel uncomfortable knowing the agent saw
  - content that could embarrass the user
- When a positive interest signal is found (e.g. user browsed "best cafes in Shanghai" or watched a video about watercolor painting):
  - note it as a lightweight signal in the SoulJournal under "browsing context"
  - it may inform tomorrow's gift direction (e.g. a cafe-themed gift, a painting-related extension)
  - NEVER mention "I saw you were browsing X" directly. Let the browsing insight subtly shape the gift's theme or content direction without revealing the source.
- If the user has not explicitly granted browsing access or if scanning feels intrusive for the situation, skip this entirely. When in doubt, do not scan.
- This feature should feel like serendipity to the user ("wow, how did it know I was into this?"), never like surveillance.

### Audio in H5 Gifts

Most emotion or atmosphere-driven H5 gifts benefit from background music. Treat audio as a default enhancement for these gifts, not an optional extra.

#### When to add audio (default yes):
- atmospheric, dreamy, poetic, or emotional gifts
- gifts with slow reveal or contemplative pacing
- gifts themed around music, seasons, or memories
- any gift where the emotional tone is the primary return

#### When NOT to add audio:
- meme/funny/ironic gifts where music would undercut the humor
- practical/utility gifts (KPI, checklist, guide)
- fast-interaction gifts (quick tap/swipe games)
- any gift where silence is deliberately part of the effect

#### How to add:

**Step 1: Choose audio.**

Try `{baseDir}/scripts/fetch-music.sh` first to find a scene-matching track:
```
bash {baseDir}/scripts/fetch-music.sh "warm piano calm" ./temp-audio.mp3 30 workspace/daily-gift/setup-state.json
```
If it returns a path, use that file. If it returns empty (no Freesound token or no results), fall back to a preset from `{baseDir}/assets/audio/`. If the preset bundle is missing locally, fetch it first via `{baseDir}/scripts/fetch-asset-bundle.sh "audio"`.

**Step 2: Fallback presets** (always available, no API needed):
- `warm-piano.mp3` → healing, nostalgic, tender
- `dreamy-ambient.mp3` → dreamy, poetic, surreal
- `playful-cute.mp3` → cute, bright, cheerful
- `night-jazz.mp3` → nighttime, urban, reflective
- `vocal-lofi.mp3` → lo-fi with vocal, cozy
- `rain-melancholy.mp3` → sad, quiet, rainy

**Step 3: Embed in HTML.**

Base64-encode the mp3 and add:
```html
<audio id="bgm" loop autoplay>
  <source src="data:audio/mp3;base64,..." type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

Add touch-to-play for mobile (autoplay is blocked until first user gesture):
```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('touchstart', () => {
  document.getElementById('bgm').play();
}, { once: true });
```

Add a small mute/unmute button (🔇/🔊) in a corner.

Keep audio files under 500KB to avoid bloating the HTML.

#### Audio Selection Priority

1. FIRST: try Freesound search with specific genre terms (e.g. "piano loop", "ambient pad gentle", "acoustic guitar calm") — avoid generic mood words like "calm warm" which match anything
2. Check the result against the filename sanity filter (fetch-music.sh does this automatically)
3. If sanity check passes → use it
4. If sanity check fails or no results after progressive simplification → fallback to preset audio from `{baseDir}/assets/audio/` (fetch bundle `audio` first if the presets are missing locally)

Do NOT skip Freesound and default to preset out of caution. The sanity check exists to catch bad results, not to justify avoiding the search entirely. Presets are the safety net, not the first choice.

#### Audio Quality Check

Freesound search results are not always accurate. The filename sanity check in fetch-music.sh automatically rejects filenames containing alert, bell, notification, alarm, siren, horn, click, beep, ring, train, or whistle.

Additional manual checks before embedding:
1. Verify the file duration is reasonable for a loop (5-30 seconds)
2. Prefer specific genre terms in search queries rather than generic mood words
3. When the sanity check has already passed, trust the result — do not second-guess it into a preset fallback

#### Deferred Freesound Setup

If the agent wants to search for scene-specific music but no Freesound token is configured:
- ask the user once: "想让礼物有背景音乐吗？需要花1分钟注册一个免费的音乐搜索 token~"
- guide them to https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/
- save token to setup-state under `tools.freesound.api_key`
- if user declines, use preset audio and do not ask again for at least 10 gifts
- do NOT avoid music H5 just because the token is missing - presets are always available

#### Audio Unavailable Handling

When a gift was clearly designed with music in mind, do not silently collapse that intent without leaving a trace in behavior or delivery.

Fallback order:
1. Try scene-specific music via Freesound when configured
2. If Freesound is unavailable or unsuitable, fall back to a local preset from `{baseDir}/assets/audio/` (fetch bundle `audio` first if needed)
3. If neither path is available, continue without music rather than blocking the gift, but note briefly in delivery that background music was intended and could not be included in this run

Do not normalize permanent no-music behavior from a missing token alone. If multiple gifts in a row wanted scene-specific music but could only use presets or silence because Freesound is not configured, the Deferred Freesound Setup mechanism should eventually trigger again according to its cooldown rules instead of being silently skipped forever.
- Do not ask the user to choose a gift style during setup. Gift style should be inferred later from `soul.md`, user interaction patterns, memory, and the actual day.
- Final H5 gifts must follow the self-contained output rules in `{baseDir}/references/html-spec.md`.
- Treat pattern cards and templates as references, not fixed scripts. Borrow their logic, mechanics, pacing, or surface treatment as needed, but keep adapting them to the actual user, day, and relationship context.
- A usable pattern does not need to have a reusable template. Reference-only pattern cards and example images are valid inputs when they provide enough expressive guidance.
- Prefer reading a pattern card's own lightweight metadata when present, especially `Status`, `Template Status`, `Reference Assets`, and `Fit Scope`.
- Do not assume the current pattern library is exhaustive. If none of the existing cards fit well enough, invent a new form or hybrid move that better matches the relationship moment.
- The templates in `{baseDir}/assets/templates/` represent the minimum visual quality bar. Final gifts should be at least as polished as these templates. If the planned output would look significantly simpler, rougher, or more generic than the templates, reconsider the approach before writing HTML.
- Templates define a mechanical reference and quality floor, not a visual composition to reproduce. Every gift must have its own visual metaphor derived from the actual content. `Reskinned template` is not an acceptable outcome.
- When `user_portrait.available` is true, treat the user's appearance description as a persistent creative asset. Use it selectively in gifts where the user's presence adds emotional value. Do not overuse it.
