# When .click() Doesn't Click

Your agent found the button. It called `.click()`. Nothing happened.

React dropzone? Ignored. File upload dialog? Security-blocked. Native macOS prompt? Invisible to CDP. You try AppleScript `click at`. Still nothing. You try `setFileInputFiles`. Works on some sites, silently fails on SPAs.

**CGEvent doesn't have this problem.** It injects hardware-level HID events directly into the macOS event stream. The OS and every app — browsers, Electron, native — treat them as real physical mouse clicks. Because at the system level, they are.

Zero dependencies. Python 3 stdlib only. One script.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Click at screen coordinates (500, 300)
python3 scripts/macos_click.py click 500 300

# Get a window's position
python3 scripts/macos_click.py window "Safari"
# → Safari: x=0, y=38, w=1440, h=860

# Double-click, right-click, drag
python3 scripts/macos_click.py doubleclick 500 300
python3 scripts/macos_click.py rightclick 500 300
python3 scripts/macos_click.py drag 100 200 500 300
```

**One-time setup:** Grant Accessibility access to your terminal app (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → add Terminal/iTerm/OpenClaw).

---

## How It Works

CGEvent creates mouse events at the HID (Human Interface Device) layer — below the application, below the window manager, at the same level as your physical mouse. Every app trusts it because macOS can't tell the difference.

```python
from scripts.macos_click import click, doubleclick, rightclick, move, drag

# Click a button at screen coordinates
click(750, 400)

# Double-click to select a word
doubleclick(750, 400)

# Right-click for context menu
rightclick(750, 400)

# Move without clicking (hover)
move(750, 400)

# Drag from point A to point B
drag(100, 200, 500, 300)
```

All coordinates are **absolute screen pixels**. On a 1440p display, `(0, 0)` is top-left, `(1440, 900)` is bottom-right. Multi-monitor setups extend the coordinate space across displays.

---

## Finding Coordinates

The hardest part isn't clicking — it's knowing *where* to click. Three approaches:

### 1. Window Position (fastest)

```bash
python3 scripts/macos_click.py window "Safari"
# → Safari: x=0, y=38, w=1440, h=860

python3 scripts/macos_click.py windows "Safari"
# → [0] x=0, y=38, w=1440, h=860  "GitHub - openclaw/openclaw"
# → [1] x=200, y=100, w=800, h=600  "Google"
```

Then calculate: `screen_x = window_x + offset_x`, `screen_y = window_y + offset_y`.

### 2. Screenshot + Measure (most reliable)

```bash
# Capture full screen
/usr/sbin/screencapture -x /tmp/screen.png

# Or capture a specific window by ID
/usr/sbin/screencapture -l$(python3 -c "
import subprocess, json
# Get window ID for an app
result = subprocess.run(['osascript', '-e', '''
tell application \"System Events\"
    tell process \"Safari\"
        return id of front window
    end tell
end tell
'''], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout.strip())
") -o /tmp/window.png
```

Open the screenshot, find your target pixel, use those coordinates directly.

**This is the most reliable method.** Don't estimate — measure.

### 3. Browser Viewport → Screen (for web automation)

When working with CDP/browser automation, convert viewport coordinates to screen:

```python
# Get browser window metrics
# screen_x = window_x + viewport_x
# screen_y = window_y + chrome_height + viewport_y
#
# chrome_height = window.outerHeight - window.innerHeight (title bar + tabs + address bar)
```

⚠️ **Always re-measure before clicking.** Windows move, dialogs appear, layouts shift. Screenshot → click → screenshot is the safe pattern.

## File Dialog Navigation

CGEvent opens the dialog. AppleScript navigates it. They're a team:

```bash
# Step 1: CGEvent click opens a file upload dialog
python3 scripts/macos_click.py click 750 400

# Step 2: AppleScript navigates the native file dialog
# Open "Go to Folder" (Cmd+Shift+G)
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}'
sleep 1

# Paste the file path
echo -n "/path/to/file.png" | pbcopy
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events"
    keystroke "a" using {command down}
    delay 0.3
    keystroke "v" using {command down}
end tell'
sleep 0.5

# Navigate to file, then click Open
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return'
sleep 1.5
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return'
```

### Why AppleScript for dialogs?

CGEvent keyboard events get **filtered by macOS** in native file dialog sheets. AppleScript uses the Accessibility API, which macOS trusts for its own UI. Use CGEvent for clicks, AppleScript for keystrokes in native dialogs.

**Tips:**
- Paste the **full file path including filename** — macOS navigates to the directory and selects the file
- `sleep`/`delay` values matter — too fast and keystrokes get swallowed
- **Activate the target app first** before sending AppleScript keystrokes:
  ```bash
  osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to activate'
  ```

## When to Use What

| Method | Web clicks | File dialogs | Native UI | React dropzones |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CDP `.click()` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| JS `element.click()` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| CDP `setFileInputFiles` | — | Sometimes | — | ❌ |
| AppleScript `click button` | ✅ (a11y) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| AppleScript `click at {x,y}` | ❌ | ❌ | Partial | ❌ |
| **CGEvent** | **✅** | **✅** | **✅** | **✅** |

**CGEvent wins because** it operates at the hardware event layer. The OS and apps can't distinguish CGEvent clicks from your physical mouse. Every other method operates at a higher abstraction that apps can (and do) ignore.

## Common Patterns

### Upload a file to a web app
```bash
# 1. Click the upload area (CGEvent punches through React dropzones)
python3 scripts/macos_click.py click 750 400
sleep 1

# 2. Navigate the file dialog (AppleScript for native UI)
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}'
sleep 1
echo -n "/Users/me/image.png" | pbcopy
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events"
    keystroke "a" using {command down}
    delay 0.3
    keystroke "v" using {command down}
end tell'
sleep 0.5
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return'
sleep 1.5
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return'
```

### Click through a multi-step UI
```bash
# Screenshot → identify target → click → repeat
/usr/sbin/screencapture -x /tmp/step1.png
python3 scripts/macos_click.py click 500 300
sleep 1
/usr/sbin/screencapture -x /tmp/step2.png
python3 scripts/macos_click.py click 600 400
```

### Interact with a system dialog
```bash
# CGEvent triggers the dialog
python3 scripts/macos_click.py click 750 400
sleep 1

# AppleScript types and confirms
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events"
    keystroke "my input text"
    delay 0.3
    keystroke return
end tell'
```

## Gotchas

1. **Coordinates are absolute screen pixels.** If the window moves, your coordinates are wrong. Always re-measure.
2. **Multi-monitor:** Coordinates span all displays. Second monitor at x=1440+ (or wherever macOS places it).
3. **Retina displays:** Coordinates are in *logical* pixels, not physical. A Retina MacBook at 2x still uses logical coords (e.g., 1440×900 not 2880×1800).
4. **Non-Retina / external displays:** 1:1 pixel mapping. What you see is what you get.
5. **`front window` might be wrong.** Multiple windows? Use `windows` command to list all and find the right one.
6. **Accessibility permissions required.** Grant to Terminal/iTerm/OpenClaw in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility. Without this, events are silently dropped.
7. **Activate the app first** for AppleScript keystrokes. Focus matters.
8. **Sleep between actions.** UI needs time to respond. 0.5-1.5s between click and next action is safe.

## FAQ

**What is this skill?**
A zero-dependency Python script to simulate mouse clicks on macOS using CoreGraphics CGEvent — the same hardware-level event system your physical mouse uses. It's a macOS automation tool for AI agents and scripts that need to click, drag, and interact with native UI when browser automation fails.

**What problem does it solve?**
AI agents doing browser automation hit a wall when CDP `.click()`, JavaScript `.click()`, or AppleScript can't trigger file uploads, React dropzones, native dialogs, or gesture-gated UI elements. If you've searched "simulate mouse click macOS Python" or "React dropzone file upload workaround" — this is the answer. CGEvent bypasses all of these because it operates below the application layer.

**What are the requirements?**
macOS, Python 3 (stdlib only — no pip installs), and Accessibility permissions for your terminal app. That's it.

**Does it work with any app?**
Yes. CGEvent is OS-level — it works with browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Brave, Arc), Electron apps, native macOS apps, and anything that accepts mouse input. If your physical mouse can click it, CGEvent can too.

**Why not just use AppleScript?**
AppleScript `click at {x, y}` doesn't work on web content inside browsers. AppleScript `click button` works via the accessibility tree but can't target arbitrary pixel positions or punch through custom web components like React dropzones. CGEvent for clicks + AppleScript for native dialog keystrokes is the winning combination.

**Is this safe?**
CGEvent simulates input — it doesn't read screen content, capture keystrokes, or access any data. It's the same mechanism macOS accessibility tools use. The Accessibility permission is required specifically so the OS knows your app is authorized to generate synthetic input. App name inputs are sanitized to prevent AppleScript injection.

**How do I use CGEvent with Python on macOS?**
This skill provides a complete CGEvent Python example — import the functions (`click`, `doubleclick`, `rightclick`, `move`, `drag`) or use the CLI. No Objective-C, no PyObjC, no pip installs. Just Python 3 stdlib `ctypes` calling CoreGraphics directly.
