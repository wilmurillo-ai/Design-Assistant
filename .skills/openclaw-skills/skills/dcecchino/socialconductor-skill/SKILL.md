# SocialConductor — Facebook, Instagram, YouTube & TikTok

Control your SocialConductor AI comment bots from WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, or iMessage.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | Dashboard |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 👥 Facebook / Instagram | ✅ Live | podium.socialconductor.ai |
| 📺 YouTube | ✅ Live | studio.socialconductor.ai |
| 🎵 TikTok | ✅ Live | violin.socialconductor.ai |

Each platform uses its own API key. You can connect one, two, or all three —
commands are prefixed by platform so OpenClaw always knows which bot you mean.

---

## Facebook / Instagram — Account Requirements

> ⚠️ **Facebook requires a Business or Professional Creator account.**
> A personal Facebook profile will not work. Before connecting, make sure you have:
>
> - A **Facebook Page** (not a personal profile) set up at [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)
> - Your Page linked to a **Business Manager** or configured as a **Professional Creator Page**
> - Admin or Editor role on the Page
>
> Instagram automation is available if your Instagram account is connected to
> your Facebook Page as a **Professional (Creator or Business) Instagram account**.
> A standard personal Instagram account will not work.

## Facebook / Instagram — Setup (first time only)

Say:

> connect my facebook page

OpenClaw registers you and sends a browser link. Open it, log in with Facebook
(~30 seconds), close the tab. All Facebook and Instagram commands are now active.

> **Important:** Before the bot can post live replies, you must accept the
> SocialConductor terms of service at
> **https://podium.socialconductor.ai/terms** — takes 30 seconds.
> Until you do, the bot runs in simulation mode (replies are generated but
> not posted). You will see a `terms_required` error in chat as a reminder.

## Auth

Each platform issues its own Bearer token via `POST /api/openclaw/register`
with `{"openclaw_user_id": "..."}`. Tokens are stored locally by OpenClaw and
sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every call. Keys are SHA-256 hashed
before server-side storage — the plaintext is never saved remotely.

| Platform | Register endpoint |
|----------|-------------------|
| Facebook / Instagram | https://podium.socialconductor.ai/api/openclaw/register |
| YouTube | https://studio.socialconductor.ai/api/openclaw/register |
| TikTok | https://violin.socialconductor.ai/api/openclaw/register |
