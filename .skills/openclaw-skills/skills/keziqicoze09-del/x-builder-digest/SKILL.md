# X Builder Digest

Generate a bilingual digest from structured social-feed JSON.

## Use this skill when
- The input is already collected from X/Twitter, podcasts, or blogs
- The user wants English and Chinese markdown outputs
- The user wants first-mention person blurbs
- The user wants Chinese output to be a real summary, not untranslated English text

## Do not include in public outputs
- Private chat IDs, bot tokens, cookies, auth headers, session files
- Local absolute paths from the operator machine
- Internal repo names unless the user explicitly wants them kept
- Proprietary watchlists unless they are intentionally bundled as sample data

## Workflow
1. Accept a structured JSON payload with keys like `stats`, `x`, `podcasts`, and `blogs`.
2. Generate two markdown files:
   - `digest-en.md`
   - `digest-zh.md`
3. In English output:
   - keep concise source-derived summaries
   - preserve original links
4. In Chinese output:
   - produce actual Chinese summaries, not English text with Chinese headings
   - add a short person blurb on first mention when available
   - preserve original links
5. If the user asks for a more executive style, compress to fewer bullets and stronger prioritization.

## File layout
- Main script: `scripts/render_digest.py`
- Example input: `references/sample-input.json`
- Example output: `references/sample-output-zh.md`

## Running
Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/render_digest.py input.json output_dir
```

This writes English and Chinese markdown outputs into `output_dir`.

## Notes
- Keep the skill generic. Inputs are user-provided JSON, not hardcoded private data.
- If a team wants custom people blurbs, store them in a simple dictionary inside the script or in a separate JSON file.
- Prefer explicit overrides for high-value names rather than pretending freeform translation is always good.
