## ?? CRITICAL: BRIEFING FORMAT (READ FIRST)

```

```

### MANDATORY RULES

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **ONE response** | Complete briefing in a single message |

## Why This Exists

Every morning you face the same questions:
- What's overdue?
- What's due today?
- What meetings do I have?
- What's the context I need to remember?

Instead of checking 5 different places, get one briefing.

## For the AI: How to Generate a Daily Briefing

When a user asks for a briefing, follow these steps.

### Step 0: Pre-Flight Check

Before generating the briefing, confirm:
- [ ] Will respond in ONE message
- [ ] Will use the exact format from the CRITICAL section
- [ ] Will include the Focus statement at the end

### Step 1: Gather Data Sources

Check for these files in order:

```
1. todo.md (to-do list from ai-meeting-notes)
2. meeting-notes/ folder (recent meeting notes)
3. MEMORY.md (if using ai-persona-os)
4. memory/[today].md (session notes)
5. Calendar integration (if available)
```

**If no data sources exist:**
```
No existing to-do list or meeting notes found.

Would you like me to:
? Create a to-do list? (just tell me your tasks)
? Process some meeting notes? (paste them here)
? Set up a simple priority list for today?
```

### Step 2: Extract Overdue Items

From `todo.md`, find items in the "?? Overdue" section.

**Display format:**
```
?? OVERDUE ([X] items)
? [Task] ¡ª was due [date]
? [Task] ¡ª was due [date]
```

**Rules:**
- Show max 5 items (if more: "+ [X] more overdue")
- Most urgent first
- Include original due date
- If none: Skip this section entirely

### Step 3: Extract Today's Priorities

Combine from multiple sources:

1. **From todo.md:**
   - "?? Due Today" section
   - "?? This Week" items due today

2. **From meeting-notes/:**
   - Action items assigned to user with today's deadline
   - Follow-ups due today

3. **From calendar:**
   - Important meetings to prep for
   - Deadlines

**Display format:**
```
?? TODAY'S PRIORITIES
1. [ ] [Task] ¡ª [deadline/context]
2. [ ] [Task] ¡ª [deadline/context]
3. [ ] [Task] ¡ª [deadline/context]
```

**Rules:**
- Show max 5 items
- Numbered for easy reference
- Include checkbox format
- Prioritize by: urgency ¡ú importance ¡ú order mentioned

### Step 4: Calendar Overview

If calendar data is available:

**Display format:**
```
?? CALENDAR
? [Time] ¡ª [Event]
? [Time] ¡ª [Event]
? [Time] ¡ª [Event]
```

**Rules:**
- Chronological order
- Show all events (don't truncate)
- Include time and event name
- If no calendar: Skip this section or note "No calendar connected"

### Step 5: Context from Recent Meetings

Scan `meeting-notes/` folder for files from last 3-7 days.

Extract:
- Key decisions made
- Important context to remember
- Upcoming deadlines mentioned
- People/relationships to follow up with

**Display format:**
```
?? CONTEXT (from recent meetings)
? [Key insight 1]
? [Key insight 2]
? [Key insight 3]
```

**Rules:**
- Max 5 context items
- Only include relevant/actionable context
- Reference the meeting if helpful: "(from client-call)"
- If no recent meetings: Skip this section

### Step 6: Generate Focus Statement

Based on everything gathered, determine the ONE most important thing.

**Criteria for choosing focus:**
1. Overdue items with consequences
2. High-stakes meetings today
3. Deadlines that can't slip
4. Dependencies blocking others

**Display format:**
```
?? FOCUS FOR TODAY
[One clear sentence about the single most important thing]
```

**Examples:**
- "Get the Acme proposal sent ¡ª it's 2 days overdue and they're waiting."
- "Prep for the investor call at 2pm ¡ª everything else can wait."
- "Clear the 3 overdue tasks before starting anything new."
- "No fires today ¡ª use this for deep work on the Q2 plan."

### Step 7: Assemble the Briefing

Put it all together in the exact format:

```
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
?? DAILY BRIEFING ¡ª [Day], [Month] [Date], [Year]
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥

[Overdue section ¡ª if any]

[Today's Priorities section]

[Calendar section ¡ª if available]

[Context section ¡ª if any]

[Focus statement ¡ª always]

©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
```

### Step 8: Handle Variations

**"What's overdue?"**
```
?? OVERDUE ITEMS

1. [Task] ¡ª was due [date]
2. [Task] ¡ª was due [date]

[If none: "Nothing overdue! You're caught up."]
```

**"What's on my calendar?"**
```
?? TODAY'S CALENDAR ¡ª [Date]

? [Time] ¡ª [Event]
? [Time] ¡ª [Event]

[Tomorrow preview if requested]
```

**"Weekly preview" / "What's this week look like?"**
```
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
?? WEEKLY PREVIEW ¡ª Week of [Date]
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥

MONDAY
? [Tasks/events]

TUESDAY
? [Tasks/events]

[etc.]

?? WATCH OUT FOR
? [Key deadline or conflict]
? [Important meeting]

©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
```

### Edge Cases

**No data sources found:**
- Don't show empty briefing
- Offer to help set up todo list or process notes

**First time user:**
- Explain where data comes from
- Offer to create initial setup

**Weekend briefing:**
- Lighter format
- Focus on upcoming week prep
- Skip "today's priorities" if nothing scheduled

**End of day request:**
- Shift to "what's left today" + "tomorrow preview"
- Acknowledge time of day

### Tone

- **Crisp and actionable** ¡ª No fluff
- **Honest about priorities** ¡ª Don't sugarcoat overdue items
- **Encouraging but real** ¡ª "Busy day, but manageable"
- **Proactive** ¡ª Surface things before they're problems
