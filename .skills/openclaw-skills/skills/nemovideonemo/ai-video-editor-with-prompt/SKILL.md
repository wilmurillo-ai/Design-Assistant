description: >
  edit raw video footage into prompt-edited video with this skill. Works with MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM files up to 500MB. content creators and marketers use it for editing videos by typing plain-text instructions instead of manual timeline editing — processing takes 30-90 seconds on cloud GPUs and you get 1080p MP4 files.

## Getting Started

> Share your raw video footage and I'll get started on prompt-driven AI editing. Or just tell me what you're thinking.

**Try saying:**
- "edit my raw video footage"
- "export 1080p MP4"
- "cut the pauses, add background music,"

### First-Time Connection

When a user first opens this skill, connect to the processing backend automatically. Briefly let them know (e.g. "Setting up...").

**Authentication**: Check if `NEMO_TOKEN` is set in the environment. If it is, skip to step 2.

1. **Obtain a free token**: Generate a random UUID as client identifier. POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with header `X-Client-Id` set to that UUID. The response `data.token` is your NEMO_TOKEN — 100 free credits, valid 7 days.
2. **Create a session**: POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Content-Type: application/json`, and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"<detected>"}`. Store the returned `session_id` for all subsequent requests.

Keep setup communication brief. Don't display raw API responses or token values to the user.

# AI Video Editor with Prompt — Edit Videos Using Text Prompts

Drop your raw video footage in the chat and tell me what you need. I'll handle the prompt-driven AI editing on cloud GPUs — you don't need anything installed locally.

Here's a typical use: you send a a 2-minute unedited screen recording, ask for cut the pauses, add background music, and put a title card at the start, and about 30-90 seconds later you've got a MP4 file ready to download. The whole thing runs at 1080p by default.

One thing worth knowing — the more specific your prompt, the more accurate the edits — include timing details when possible.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing ai video editor with prompt, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

**All requests** must include: `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>`, `X-Skill-Source`, `X-Skill-Version`, `X-Skill-Platform`. Missing attribution headers will cause export to fail with 402.

Headers are derived from this file's YAML frontmatter. `X-Skill-Source` is `ai-video-editor-with-prompt`, `X-Skill-Version` comes from the `version` field, and `X-Skill-Platform` is detected from the install path (`~/.clawhub/` = `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` = `cursor`, otherwise `unknown`).

**API base**: `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`

**Create session**: POST `/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` — body `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}` — returns `task_id`, `session_id`.

**Send message (SSE)**: POST `/run_sse` — body `{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}` with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Max timeout: 15 minutes.

**Upload**: POST `/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` — file: multipart `-F "files=@/path"`, or URL: `{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}`

**Credits**: GET `/api/credits/balance/simple` — returns `available`, `frozen`, `total`

**Session state**: GET `/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` — key fields: `data.state.draft`, `data.state.video_infos`, `data.state.generated_media`

**Export** (free, no credits): POST `/api/render/proxy/lambda` — body `{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}`. Poll GET `/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s until `status` = `completed`. Download URL at `output.url`.

Supported formats: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

### Error Codes

- `0` — success, continue normally
- `1001` — token expired or invalid; re-acquire via `/api/auth/anonymous-token`
- `1002` — session not found; create a new one
- `2001` — out of credits; anonymous users get a registration link with `?bind=<id>`, registered users top up
- `4001` — unsupported file type; show accepted formats
- `4002` — file too large; suggest compressing or trimming
- `400` — missing `X-Client-Id`; generate one and retry
- `402` — free plan export blocked; not a credit issue, subscription tier
- `429` — rate limited; wait 30s and retry once

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

### Reading the SSE Stream

Text events go straight to the user (after GUI translation). Tool calls stay internal. Heartbeats and empty `data:` lines mean the backend is still working — show "⏳ Still working..." every 2 minutes.

About 30% of edit operations close the stream without any text. When that happens, poll `/api/state` to confirm the timeline changed, then tell the user what was updated.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "cut the pauses, add background music, and put a title card at the start" → Download MP4. Takes 30-90 seconds for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "cut the pauses, add background music, and put a title card at the start" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 500MB. Stick to MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 with H.264 codec for the widest platform compatibility.
