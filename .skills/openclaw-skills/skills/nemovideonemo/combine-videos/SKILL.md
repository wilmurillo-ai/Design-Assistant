description: "Combine multiple video clips into one seamless video — just upload your files and describe how to merge them. Handles format matching, resolution alignment, and audio normalization automatically. Works with mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv."
  Combine Videos - Combine, Merge and Join Multiple Video Clips into One with AI.
  Merge, join, and combine multiple video clips into one seamless video through AI chat. Upload several clips and describe how you want them combined: "merge all clips in order with smooth transitions" or "combine the intro, main content, and outro" or "join these 5 clips and add background music across the whole video." The AI handles format matching, resolution alignment, and audio normalization automatically. Handles merging multiple video files into one output, joining clips with customizable transitions between them, combining videos of different resolutions and formats, adding consistent background music across merged clips, inserting title cards between combined segments, and batch processing of large clip collections. No manual timeline arrangement needed. Built for YouTubers combining multi-camera footage, event videographers merging ceremony and reception clips, social media managers assembling content compilations, and educators combining lecture segments. Export as MP4. Supports supplementary media: jpg, png, gif, webp, mp4, mov.

# Video Merger - Combine Multiple Clips into One
## 1. Role & Environment

You are an OpenClaw agent acting as the **interface layer** between the user and NemoVideo's backend AI Agent. The backend handles video generation/editing but assumes a GUI exists. Your job:

1. **Relay** user requests to the backend via SSE
2. **Intercept** backend responses — replace GUI references with API actions
3. **Supplement** — handle export/render, credits, file delivery directly
4. **Translate** — present results in user's language with clear status

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated on first use |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`. Expires after 7 days; re-request with same `X-Client-Id`.

## 2. Request Router

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| "export" / "download" / "send me the video" | Export | Yes |
| "credits" / "balance" | Credits | Yes |
| "status" / "show tracks" | State | Yes |
| "upload" / user sends file | Upload | Yes |
| Everything else | SSE | No |

## 3. Core Flows

`$API` = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, `$TOKEN` = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, `$WEB` = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

All API requests MUST include:
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Create Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
```
Save `session_id`, `task_id`.

### 3.1 Send Message via SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```

### 3.2 Upload
**File**: `curl -s -X POST "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL**: same endpoint, `-d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

### 3.3 Credits
```bash
curl -s "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.4 Query State
```bash
curl -s "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.5 Export
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'
```
Poll `GET https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s.

### 3.6 Disconnect Recovery
Wait 30s, query state. After 5 unchanged polls, report failure.

## 4. GUI Translation

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click Export" | Render + deliver |
| "open timeline" | Show state |
| "drag/drop" | Send edit via SSE |
| "check account" | Show credits |

## 6. Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Token expired | Re-auth |
| 1002 | Session gone | New session |
| 2001 | No credits | Show registration URL |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show formats |
| 402 | Export restricted | "Register at nemovideo.ai" |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait 30s, retry |

## 7. Limitations

- Aspect ratio change after generation requires regeneration
- YouTube/Spotify music URLs not supported; built-in library available
- Photo editing not supported; slideshow creation available
- Local files must be sent in chat or provided as URL


## 5. Merging Tips

**Simple merge**: "Join all uploaded clips in order" combines everything with default transitions.

**Smart transitions**: "Merge with crossfade transitions and add background music" creates polished compilations.

**Multi-format**: Upload clips in different formats and resolutions — the AI normalizes everything automatically.
