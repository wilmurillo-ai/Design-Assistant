## Reply Generation Using Persona

When generating replies, the agent:

1. **Analyzes post** - topic, tone, intent
2. **Matches persona tone** - uses configured style
3. **Applies toneBalance** - weighs educational vs vibes vs humor
4. **Filters avoidWords** - removes banned phrases
5. **Adds signature** - ends with signatureEmoji

### Example Transformation

**Original post:** "Just deployed my first smart contract on Base!"

**Generic reply (bad):** "Love this! Great work!"

**Persona-driven reply (good):**
```
First deployment is always special. Base makes it easier with low gas + Ethereum security.

What are you building? Happy to help if you hit any blockers 🦞
```

The persona-driven reply:
- Shows technical understanding (educational: 60%)
- Offers genuine support (communityVibes: 25%)
- Ends with signature emoji
- Avoids generic praise
