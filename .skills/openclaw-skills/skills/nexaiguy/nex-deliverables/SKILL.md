# Nex Deliverables

Client Deliverable Tracker for agency operators and freelancers. Monitor project status, track deadlines, manage client workload, and generate professional status updates. All data is stored locally on your machine—no external services required.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- Add a new deliverable for a client project
- Update the status of a deliverable (planned, in progress, review, delivered, approved)
- Check which deliverables are overdue
- List all open deliverables for a specific client
- See the current workload across all clients
- Generate a status update email for a client
- Find a specific deliverable by searching
- Export deliverables to CSV or JSON
- View delivery statistics (delivery rate, average time to deliver, overdue percentage)

Trigger phrases: "what's open for", "what's still pending", "mark as delivered", "is this overdue", "deliverable status", "what was promised", "client status", "what's due", "deadline", "oplevering", "has this been approved", "show overdue", "client deliverables"

## Quick Setup

If the database does not exist yet, run the setup script:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This creates the data directory, installs any dependencies, and initializes the database.

## Available Commands

The CLI tool is `nex-deliverables`. All commands output plain text.

nex-deliverables add --client "Ribbens Airco" --title "Homepage redesign" --type website --deadline 2026-05-01

nex-deliverables add --client "Bakkerij Peeters" --title "Landing page" --type landing_page --deadline "next friday" --priority urgent
```

Deadline shortcuts: "today", "tomorrow", "next week", "next friday", or YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Output Parsing

All CLI output is plain text, structured for easy parsing:

- Deliverable IDs in brackets: `[42]`
- Status indicators: ⚪ planned, 🟡 in_progress, 🟠 review, 🟢 delivered, ✅ approved, ❌ rejected
- Overdue items marked with ⚠️
- Section headers separated with dashes
- Every command output ends with `[Nex Deliverables by Nex AI | nex-ai.be]`

When presenting output to the user, strip the footer line and present the information naturally. Do not show raw database paths or internal details.

## Important Notes

- All deliverable data is stored locally at `~/.nex-deliverables/`. No telemetry, no analytics.
- No external API calls are made—fully offline.
- Database is initialized automatically on first use.
- Deliverable types have default SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for automatic deadline calculation. For example, a website defaults to 30 days, a logo to 7 days.
- Deadlines support natural language shortcuts: "today", "tomorrow", "next week", "next Friday" for convenience.
- The system tracks full status history for each deliverable, showing when and how status changed.
- Search is case-insensitive and matches any part of title, description, or notes.
- Export formats: CSV (spreadsheet-friendly) and JSON (programmatic use).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Database not found"**: Run `bash setup.sh` to initialize the database.
- **"Deliverable not found"**: Check the spelling or use `nex-deliverables search` to find it.
- **"Client not found"**: Add the client first with `nex-deliverables client add --name "..."`.
- **No output**: Check that Python 3 is installed and accessible.

## Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- **clients**: Client information (name, contact, email, phone, retainer details, status)
- **deliverables**: Deliverable tracking (title, type, status, priority, deadline, dates, hours)
- **milestones**: Sub-tasks within deliverables
- **status_updates**: Historical record of all status changes
