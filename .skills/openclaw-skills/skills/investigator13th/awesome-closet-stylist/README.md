# awesome-closet-stylist

A high-autonomy, boundary-constrained Claude Code skill for maintaining a persistent personal wardrobe, answering wardrobe questions, and recommending outfits from existing clothes in natural language.

## What it does

This skill helps the agent:
- maintain a persistent wardrobe
- add, correct, update, or delete clothing items
- answer wardrobe queries by category, season, color, style, or similar conditions
- recommend outfits from recorded items the user already owns
- refine a previous outfit recommendation without unnecessarily rebuilding the whole look
- use images as auxiliary input for clothing identification and intake
- handle item notes, long-term preferences, and weather-aware context within clear policy boundaries

## Design direction

This skill is intentionally designed as a policy-driven agent skill, not a workflow-driven form.

Key principles:
- keep responses natural and grounded instead of exposing raw JSON
- treat `user/wardrobe.json` as the authoritative wardrobe fact source
- preserve a strict separation between `fact state`, `item notes`, `persistent preference`, and `session state`
- allow autonomous judgment while enforcing fact, write, confirmation, authorization, and automation boundaries
- ask for clarification only when missing information materially affects safe mutation or recommendation quality
- never invent clothing items the user does not own
- keep recommendation useful even when the wardrobe is sparse, while explicitly surfacing gaps

## Repository structure

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — main policy specification
- [sub-skills/wardrobe-crud.md](sub-skills/wardrobe-crud.md) — wardrobe fact mutation and query rules
- [sub-skills/outfit-recommendation.md](sub-skills/outfit-recommendation.md) — recommendation and refinement rules
- [sub-skills/clothing-notes.md](sub-skills/clothing-notes.md) — item-scoped note rules
- [sub-skills/user-preference.md](sub-skills/user-preference.md) — long-term preference persistence rules
- [sub-skills/weather.md](sub-skills/weather.md) — weather/tool boundary and fallback rules
- [user/wardrobe.json](user/wardrobe.json) — authoritative wardrobe data
- [user/preference.json](user/preference.json) — durable user preferences
- [user/config.json](user/config.json) — local user configuration, including weather-related configuration
- [evals/evals.json](evals/evals.json) — evaluation scenarios covering maintenance, retrieval, recommendation, refinement, and boundary cases

## Example requests

- "I just bought a dark gray wool coat. Add it to my wardrobe."
- "What outerwear do I already have that works for spring?"
- "Tomorrow is about 18°C and windy. I need something for a client meeting using what I already own."
- "Keep the outfit mostly the same, just make the shoes feel more relaxed."
- "Recommend something for today, but I don't want to wear black."

## Initialization behavior

If `user/wardrobe.json` has no items, treat the wardrobe as uninitialized.

In that case, the skill should:
- explain its capability range in natural language
- invite the user to upload clothing photos or describe a few commonly worn items
- avoid turning initialization into a field-collection form
- record a minimally usable wardrobe as soon as there is enough information to do so safely
- mention that weather-aware help can be configured through `user/config.json` when relevant

The goal is to reach a minimally usable wardrobe quickly, not to fully model the closet in one pass.

## Data model

A new wardrobe item should be recordable once the minimum usable fact record is safe to establish:
- `id`
- `category`
- `name`

Optional fields may include:
- `sub-category`
- `color`
- `seasons`
- `style`
- `material`
- `warmth`
- `notes`
- `image_refs`

The skill should not block a valid add request merely because optional metadata is missing.

## Evaluation coverage

The eval set covers:
- adding wardrobe items
- wardrobe queries and filtering
- outfit recommendation from existing clothes only
- refinement of a prior recommendation
- near-empty wardrobe handling
- ambiguous deletion clarification
- image-assisted intake
- session-only versus durable preference boundaries
- item-note handling inside recommendation turns
- no-invention closest-match behavior
- explicit tradeoff surfacing
- confirmation-gated actions inside compound requests

## v1.0.2 updates

Version 1.0.2 makes the skill easier to use and easier to maintain.

Notable updates:
- keeps the skill high-autonomy, while making its operating boundaries clearer
- unifies the core state model and terminology across the main spec and sub-specs
- clarifies how the skill handles facts, writes, confirmation, and tool usage
- improves handling for multi-intent requests, temporary constraints, and sparse wardrobes
- expands eval coverage for recommendation quality, deletion safety, and no-invention behavior
- keeps the packaged release content English-only for consistency
