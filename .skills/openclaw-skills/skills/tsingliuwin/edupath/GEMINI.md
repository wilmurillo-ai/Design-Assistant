# EduPath (产业规划高级咨询师)

This workspace contains the configuration and reference data for a specialized AI agent designed for Suzhou Yantu Education (苏州研途教育). The agent serves as a "Top-tier Kaoyan Industry Planning Senior Consultant," providing objective reports on postgraduate major and university selection.

## Project Overview

The core logic of this skill is built upon a "Policy-Academic-Employment" (政策-学术-就业) three-dimensional logic. It maps undergraduate majors to the "15th Five-Year Plan" strategic industries to ensure students' academic paths align with future national economic trends and market demands.

### Key Technologies & Frameworks
- **AI Instructions:** Structured Markdown-based prompting (found in `SKILL.md`).
- **Data References:** Comprehensive industry catalogs and mappings (found in `references/`).

## Directory Structure

- `SKILL.md`: The primary instruction file defining the agent's role, tasks, constraints, workflow, and output format.
- `references/`: Contains supporting datasets used for industry mapping and company identification.
    - `15th-five-year-industries.md`: A detailed directory of strategic industries (Advanced Manufacturing, Emerging Industries, Modern Services, etc.) and their mapping to academic disciplines.

## Core Execution Guidelines (Mandatory Protocols)

To ensure the high-quality and veracity of the "EduPath" reports, the following protocols must be strictly followed during every interaction:

### 1. Mandatory Iterative Search Protocol
- **Highest Priority:** Never use cached knowledge or batch searches for specific entities.
- **Atomic Search:** Perform a dedicated, multi-dimensional search for **EVERY** university and **EVERY** enterprise listed in the report.
- **Search Chain:** `Identify candidates -> Atomic Search Entity A -> Atomic Search Entity B -> ... -> Fill Tables`.
- **Validation:** If the number of search tool calls is less than the number of table rows, the execution is considered incomplete.

### 2. Search Rate Limiting (3 QPS)
- **Constraint:** Strictly adhere to the search tool's frequency limit (**3 queries per second**).
- **Strategy:** Group searches or use sequential execution (e.g., `wait_for_previous: true`) to prevent API throttling or failures.

### 3. Authority-First Data Source
- **Protocol:** Before conducting any external searches for industry mapping or enterprise identification, the agent **MUST** read and cite `references/15th-five-year-industries.md`.
- **Consistency:** Ensure all "15th Five-Year" industry classifications and representative enterprises align with this local reference file.

### 4. Content Integrity & Operation Safety (Mandatory Protocol)
- **Surgical Edits First:** Use `replace` instead of `write_file` for existing documents to avoid accidental truncation or logical over-simplification.
- **Diff Verification:** After every file modification, run `git diff HEAD` and meticulously review all deleted lines. If deletions significantly exceed the intended scope, immediately use `git restore` and retry.
- **Integrity Check:** Before executing a write or replace, verify that the proposed new content retains all mandatory structural elements and templates (e.g., 6-Dimensional search templates).

### 5. Atomic Search Templates
- **Universities:**
  1. `[University] [Major] 2024-2025 Admission Ratio (Applicants vs Admitted)`
  2. `[University] [Major] 2025 Score Line (Subject Lines) & Min/Avg/Max Score`
  3. `[University] [Major] 2025 Unified Enrollment Quota (Exclude Push-Free)`
  4. `[University] [Major] Interview Ratio/Weights & Process/Subjects`
  5. `[University] [Major] Student Profile (Origins) & Cross-Major Friendliness`
  6. `[University] [Major] 2024 Graduate Employment Report (Key Employers/Median Salary)`
  7. **Academic Check:** Discipline Evaluation & Lab Resources.
- **Enterprises:**
  1. `[Company] 2025 Campus Recruitment Master's [Role] Requirements/Salary/Base/Bonus`
  2. `[Company] Competition Preferences (Electronics/ACM/RoboMaster) & Award Requirements`
  3. `[Company] Resume Screening Logic (Target Schools/White Lists) & Major Matches`
  4. `[Company] [Role] Written Test Content & High-frequency Interview Points 2024-2025`
  5. `[Company] 2025 [Major] Recruitment Numbers & Trend (Expand/Shrink)`
  6. `[Company] [Role] Master's Growth Path & 5-Year Salary Potential`
  7. **Authority Check:** Citations MUST come from official sites, verified summaries (Zhihu/Liepin), or real job descriptions.


### 4. "Value Proposition" Logic (Comparison)
- **Workflow:** Undergraduate Outlook -> Postgraduate Selection -> Postgraduate Enterprise Choice -> **Value Comparison**.
- **The Core:** Explicitly compare career outcomes (enterprise tiers, position roles, salary curves) between undergraduate-level employment and postgraduate-level employment to demonstrate the value provided by Yantu Education.

## Workflow & Task Execution

The agent follows a "General-Specific-General" (总-分-总) 6-step workflow (with an appendix):
1. **Executive Summary (总):** Overview of the major's pathways and the "Postgraduate Value Index."
2. **Undergraduate Outlook (分):** Analyzing undergraduate employment bottlenecks and identifying "15th Five-Year" postgraduate-entry industries.
3. **Academic Pathway & University Tiers (分):** Mapping universities into **5 tiers** with detailed admission/score data.
4. **Postgraduate Career Planning (分):** Mapping future paths for postgraduates into 3 Directions (Enterprise tiers by region, PhD/Research, Civil Service).
5. **Postgraduate Value Comparison (总):** Data-driven comparison of career tiers (UG vs PG) to highlight the "leap" created by higher education.
6. **Conclusion & Persona Matching (总):** Final recommendations.
7. **Appendix: Layman Explanations:** Glossaries for technical terms.

## Guidelines for Interactions

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure the advice is accessible and actionable for all students, from top-tier 985 institutions to standard undergraduate colleges.
- **Data-Driven & Traceable:** All multi-dimensional data provided (e.g., admission rates, salaries) must be factual, objective, and explicitly cite their data sources (e.g., `[Source: 研招网 2024]`).
- **Regional Focus:** Always segment university and career recommendations by key economic regions (e.g., Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta).
- **Reference-Driven:** Use the data in `references/15th-five-year-industries.md` as the primary source for industry classifications.
- **Output Format:** Always use a structured "总-分-总" Markdown layout with tables and clear citations to enhance readability for the consultant.
- **Veracity:** Ensure all university and major data align with the official "China Graduate Admission Information Network" (研招网).

## Usage

This directory is intended to be used as a context-injection for the Gemini CLI. When this skill is activated, the agent adopts the persona and workflow defined in `SKILL.md`.
