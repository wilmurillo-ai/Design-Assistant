```

## How to Look Up IDs

Most endpoints require an ID that comes from the `/markets` response. Always query markets first, then pass the relevant ID to downstream endpoints.

1. **Polymarket `token_id`**: Query `/polymarket/markets`, find `side_a.id` or `side_b.id` in the response, then pass it to `/polymarket/market-price/{token_id}`.
2. **Polymarket `condition_id`**: Query `/polymarket/markets`, find `condition_id` in the response, then pass it to `/polymarket/candlesticks/{condition_id}`.
3. **Kalshi `market_ticker`**: Query `/kalshi/markets`, find `market_ticker` in the response, then pass it to `/kalshi/market-price/{market_ticker}`.

## End-to-End Examples

### Get the current price of a Polymarket market

Prices require a `token_id`, which comes from the `/markets` response. Always query markets first.

**Step 1: Find a market and extract the token_id:**

```bash
# Search for open election markets and grab a token_id
python scripts/prediction_market_client.py polymarket markets --search "election" --status open --limit 5
```

The response includes a `side_a.id` and `side_b.id` for each market; these are the token IDs for the Yes and No sides respectively:

```json
{
  "markets": [
    {
      "title": "Will Trump nationalize elections?",
      "market_slug": "will-trump-nationalize-elections",
      "condition_id": "0xe6522d64f35a6843ebdbccab2e3d4a1385350be6d40a3de766330e207b71a8ba",
      "side_a": {
        "id": "44482086252598348208660011972852804909957485351743405768768577675743702971026",
        "label": "Yes"
      },
      "side_b": {
        "id": "68987475491741167427045844503509447338405188188495224371188027929166363674438",
        "label": "No"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Fetch the current price using the token_id:**

```bash
# Use side_a.id (Yes) or side_b.id (No) from Step 1
python scripts/prediction_market_client.py polymarket price 44482086252598348208660011972852804909957485351743405768768577675743702971026
```

The price is a decimal between 0 and 1 representing the probability (e.g. `0.20` = 20% chance of Yes).

### Get the current price of a Kalshi market

**Step 1: Find a market and extract the market_ticker:**

```bash
python scripts/prediction_market_client.py kalshi markets --search "fed rate" --status open --limit 5
```

```json
{
  "markets": [
    {
      "title": "Will the federal funds rate be above 3.75% after the Mar 2026 meeting?",
      "market_ticker": "KXFED-26MAR-T3.75",
      "last_price": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Fetch the price using the market_ticker:**

```bash
python scripts/prediction_market_client.py kalshi price KXFED-26MAR-T3.75
```
