## Common Workflows

### Create an Escrow Deal

```
User: Create a $5000 escrow deal with contractor@example.com for website development

Agent: I'll use deal_create to create the deal, then fund_escrow to lock the funds,
       and oath_attest to prepare completion verification.
```

### Deploy a Monitoring Agent

```
User: Deploy an agent to monitor my active deals and alert on SLA violations

Agent: I'll use bourse_search to find monitoring skills, cadre_deploy to launch
       the agent, and fund_agent_fund to allocate operational budget.
```

### File a Dispute

```
User: The contractor didn't deliver. File a dispute for deal xyz123.

Agent: I'll use deal_get to review the deal, then parler_dispute_file with
       the evidence. The dispute enters the resolution queue.
```
