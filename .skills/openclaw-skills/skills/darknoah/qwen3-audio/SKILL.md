# Qwen3-Audio

## Overview

Qwen3-Audio is a high-performance audio processing library optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4). It delivers fast, efficient TTS and STT with support for multiple models, languages, and audio formats.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4)

### Environment checks

Before using any capability, verify that all items in `./references/env-check-list.md` are complete.

## Capabilities

### Text to Speech
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" tts --text "hello world" --output "/path_to_save.wav"
```

**Returns (JSON):**
```json
{
  "audio_path": "/path_to_save.wav",
  "duration": 1.234,
  "sample_rate": 24000
}
```

### Voice Cloning
Clone any voice using a reference audio sample. Provide the wav file and its transcript:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" tts --text "hello world" --output "/path_to_save.wav" --ref_audio "sample_audio.wav" --ref_text "This is what my voice sounds like."
```
ref_audio: reference audio to clone
ref_text: transcript of the reference audio

### Use Created Voice (Shortcut)
Use a voice created with `voice create` by its ID:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" tts --text "hello world" --output "/path_to_save.wav" --ref_voice "my-voice-id"
```
This automatically loads `ref_audio` and `ref_text` from the voice profile.

### CustomVoice (Emotion Control)
Use predefined voices with emotion/style instructions:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" tts --text "hello world" --output "/path_to_save.wav" --speaker "Ryan" --language "English" --instruct "Very happy and excited."
```

### VoiceDesign (Create Any Voice)
Create any voice from a text description:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" tts --text "hello world" --output "/path_to_save.wav" --language "English" --instruct "A cheerful young female voice with high pitch and energetic tone."
```

### Automatic Speech Recognition (STT)
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" stt --audio "/sample_audio.wav" --output "/path_to_save.txt" --output-format srt
```
Test audio: https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-ASR-Repo/asr_en.wav
output-format: "txt" | "ass" | "srt" | "all"

**Returns (JSON):**
```json
{
  "text": "transcribed text content",
  "duration": 10.5,
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "files": ["/path_to_save.txt", "/path_to_save.srt"]
}
```

### Voice Management

Voices are stored in the `voices/` directory at the skill root level. Each voice has its own folder containing:
- `ref_audio.wav` - Reference audio file
- `ref_text.txt` - Reference text transcript
- `ref_instruct.txt` - Voice style description

#### Create a Voice
Create a reusable voice profile using VoiceDesign model. The `--instruct` parameter is required to describe the voice style:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" voice create --text "This is a sample voice reference text." --instruct "A warm, friendly female voice with a professional tone." --language "English"
```
Optional: `--id "my-voice-id"` to specify a custom voice ID.

**Returns (JSON):**
```json
{
  "id": "abc12345",
  "ref_audio": "/path/to/skill/voices/abc12345/ref_audio.wav",
  "ref_text": "This is a sample voice reference text.",
  "instruct": "A warm, friendly female voice with a professional tone.",
  "duration": 3.456,
  "sample_rate": 24000
}
```

#### List Voices
List all created voice profiles:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" voice list
```

**Returns (JSON):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc12345",
    "ref_audio": "/path/to/skill/voices/abc12345/ref_audio.wav",
    "ref_text": "This is a sample voice reference text.",
    "instruct": "A warm, friendly female voice with a professional tone.",
    "duration": 3.456,
    "sample_rate": 24000
  }
]
```

#### Use a Created Voice
After creating a voice, use it for TTS with the `--ref_voice` parameter. The instruct will be automatically loaded:
```bash
uv run --python ".venv/bin/python" "./scripts/mlx-audio.py" tts --text "New text to speak" --output "/output.wav" --ref_voice "abc12345"
```
