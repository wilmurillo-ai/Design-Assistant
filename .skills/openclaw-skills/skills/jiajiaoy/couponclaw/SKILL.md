# CouponClaw

> Find coupons, stack cashback, and maximize savings — across China, US, UK, Australia, Southeast Asia, and DTC brands worldwide.

CouponClaw is the only coupon skill that covers every major market in one place. It searches verified coupon databases, finds cashback portal rates, and calculates the best stacking strategy so you always know the exact final price before checkout.

## What makes CouponClaw different

Most coupon tools check one platform in one country. CouponClaw runs a 3-layer strategy:
1. **Layer 1 — Coupons**: Real-time browser search across region-specific coupon sites (smzdm, RetailMeNot, VoucherCodes, OzBargain, ShopBack, and more)
2. **Layer 2 — Cashback stacking**: Compares 返利网, Rakuten, TopCashback, and ShopBack rates — and checks if they stack with the coupon
3. **Layer 3 — DTC brand check**: Detects hidden first-order discounts and newsletter signup offers on brand official sites

It also runs a daily deals briefing (via cron) that surfaces the hottest community-verified deals from each region every morning.
