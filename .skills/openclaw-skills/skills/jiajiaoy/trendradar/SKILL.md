# TrendRadar

> Scan social media and communities to detect trending products before they peak — then act on them with BuyWise and CouponClaw.

TrendRadar monitors 小红书, 微博, Reddit, Google Trends, and Product Hunt in real time. It assigns a trend direction (↑↑ surging / ↑ rising / → stable / ↓ cooling) and a commercial signal to each item, so you know whether to buy now, wait, or skip.

## What TrendRadar does differently

Most tools show you what's already popular. TrendRadar shows you what's about to peak — so you can get the best price before demand drives it up, or avoid buying into something already fading.

It is the upstream signal source for the entire ecosystem:
- Feed trending products into **BuyWise** for price and review analysis
- Feed trending stores into **CouponClaw** for coupon and cashback stacking
- Daily briefing surfaces the top 3 most commercially interesting trends each morning
