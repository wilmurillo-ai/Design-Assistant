# AIsa Twitter Command Center

Search X/Twitter profiles, tweets, trends, and OAuth-gated posting through AIsa. Use when: the user needs Twitter research, monitoring, or engagement workflows. Supports search, monitoring, and approved posting.

## When to use

- The user needs Twitter/X research, monitoring, posting, or engagement workflows.
- The user wants profiles, timelines, trends, lists, communities, or Spaces.
- The user wants approved posting without sharing passwords.

## High-Intent Workflows

- Research an account or conversation thread.
- Monitor a keyword, trend, or competitor.
- Authorize and publish a post after explicit approval.

## Quick Reference

- `python3 scripts/twitter_client.py --help`
- `python3 scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py --help`

## Setup

- `AISA_API_KEY` is required for AIsa-backed API access.
- Use repo-relative `scripts/` paths from the shipped package.
- Prefer explicit CLI auth flags when a script exposes them.

## Example Requests

- Research recent AI agent conversations on X
- Search how users are reacting to a product launch on Twitter
- Authorize and publish a short product update post

## Guardrails

- Do not ask for passwords, cookies, or browser credentials.
- Do not claim posting succeeded until the API confirms it.
- Return authorization links instead of relying on auto-open behavior.
