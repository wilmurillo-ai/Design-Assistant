# AIsa Provider

Use AIsa for model routing, provider setup, and Chinese LLM access. Use when: the user needs model configuration, provider guidance, or routing workflows. Supports setup and model operations.

## When to use

- The user needs model routing, provider setup, or Chinese LLM access.
- The user wants one place for provider configuration or model selection.
- The user wants setup guidance for AIsa-hosted model workflows.

## High-Intent Workflows

- Configure an AIsa provider path.
- Inspect supported models or routing options.
- Prepare a runtime for Chinese-model access.

## Setup

- `AISA_API_KEY` is required for AIsa-backed API access.
- Use repo-relative `scripts/` paths from the shipped package.
- Prefer explicit CLI auth flags when a script exposes them.

## Example Requests

- Help me configure AIsa for Qwen
- List the supported routed models
- Choose a model for Chinese long-form analysis

## Guardrails

- Do not ask for extra credentials beyond the shipped flow.
- Do not advertise setup paths that the public bundle does not ship.
- Keep setup instructions aligned with the actual runtime.
