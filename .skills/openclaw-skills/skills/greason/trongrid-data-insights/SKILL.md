# Data Insights

Comprehensive TRON network analytics — activity metrics, transaction patterns, trending tokens/contracts, top accounts, governance status, and resource economics.

# MCP Server
- **Prerequisite**: [TronGrid MCP Guide](https://developers.tron.network/reference/mcp-api)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Network Snapshot

Fetch current state (run in parallel):

1. `getNowBlock` — Current block height and timestamp
2. `getChainParameters` — Network configuration
3. `getNodeInfo` — Node count and sync status
4. `getBurnTrx` — Total TRX burned to date

### Step 2: Recent Block Activity

1. Call `getBlockByLatestNum` with count 20
2. For each block, call `getTransactionInfoByBlockNum` for transaction details

Calculate:
- **Avg transactions/block**: total txs / 20
- **Estimated daily transactions**: avg * ~28,800 (blocks/day at 3s interval)
- **Avg block time**: time delta between consecutive blocks
- **Success rate**: successful / total

### Step 3: Transaction Type Distribution

Categorize all transactions from the sample blocks:
- TRX Transfers, Smart Contract Calls, TRC-10 Transfers
- Staking Operations, Resource Delegation, Voting
- Account Creation, Other

### Step 4: Hot Contracts

1. Aggregate contract calls across recent blocks by contract address
2. For top contracts, call `getContractInfo` for names
3. Call `getTrc20Info` if the contract is a token
4. Rank by call frequency

### Step 5: Trending Tokens

1. From `getEventsByLatestBlock`, identify Transfer events
2. Aggregate transfer volume per token contract
3. For top tokens, call `getTrc20Info` for metadata
4. Use web search for price data if needed

### Step 6: Most Active Accounts

From recent transactions:
1. Rank addresses by transaction count sent
2. Rank by TRX value transferred
3. For top accounts, call `getAccount` to classify (exchange/bot/whale)

### Step 7: Governance & Staking

1. `listWitnesses` — All Super Representatives, votes, block production stats
2. From chain parameters, derive staking metrics
3. `getEnergyPrices` and `getBandwidthPrices` — Resource price trends

### Step 8: Compile Insights Report

```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Block fetch timeout | Network congestion or large blocks | Reduce block count (try 10 instead of 20) |
| Incomplete tx info | Some `getTransactionInfoByBlockNum` calls fail | Use available data, note sample size in report |
| No events in latest block | Low activity period | Expand to more blocks or note "Low activity detected" |
| Energy/bandwidth price API returns long string | Historical data is comma-separated | Parse only the last entry for current price |
