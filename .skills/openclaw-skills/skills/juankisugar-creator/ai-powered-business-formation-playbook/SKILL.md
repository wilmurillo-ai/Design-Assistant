# Incorporate — Business Formation Document Generator

Generate all legal documents needed to incorporate a business entity from a single configuration.

## Supported Entity Types & States

| Entity | States | Reference File |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| C-Corp | Nevada | `references/nevada-corp.md` |
| C-Corp | Delaware | `references/delaware-corp.md` |
| LLC | Nevada | `references/nevada-llc.md` |
| LLC | Delaware | `references/delaware-llc.md` |

## Quick Start

1. Ask the user for their company details (or have them fill out the config)
2. Read `references/config-template.md` — this is the input format
3. Read the appropriate state + entity reference file (see table above)
4. Read the document templates from `assets/templates/` (use `de-*` for Delaware, `llc-*` for LLCs)
5. Generate all documents using the config values
6. Upload to Google Drive (or output as .docx files)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Configuration

Ask the user these questions (or accept a pre-filled config):

**Required:**
- Company name
- Entity type (C-Corp, LLC)
- State of incorporation
- Registered agent name + address
- Directors/managers (names, titles)
- Shareholders/members (names, share counts or %)
- Stock structure (classes, authorized shares, par value, voting rights)

**Optional (defaults provided):**
- Par value (default: $0.00001)
- Fiscal year end (default: December 31)
- Consideration type (default: "Services")
- Principal office address (default: registered agent address)

**Option Pool (recommended):**
- Option pool size (shares reserved for future employees/advisors)
- Standard startup range: 10-20% of authorized common

Validate the config: share percentages must total 100%, authorized shares must cover all issuances (including option pool reserve).

### Step 2: Select Entity + State References

Based on entity type and state, read the appropriate reference file:
- Nevada C-Corp → `references/nevada-corp.md`
- Delaware C-Corp → `references/delaware-corp.md`
- Nevada LLC → `references/nevada-llc.md`
- Delaware LLC → `references/delaware-llc.md`

**Key decision guidance for the user:**
- **C-Corp vs LLC:** C-Corp for VC fundraising, multiple stock classes, going public. LLC for simpler businesses, pass-through taxation, flexible profit distribution.
- **Delaware vs Nevada:** Delaware for investor expectations, Court of Chancery, VC-standard docs. Nevada for no franchise tax, lower annual costs, privacy.
- **Delaware C-Corp warning:** Franchise tax can be very high with many authorized shares — always use the Assumed Par Value Capital Method (see delaware-corp.md).

### Step 3: Generate Documents

Read each template from `assets/templates/` and replace all `{{VARIABLES}}` with config values. Templates are in Markdown — convert to .docx for final output.

**Documents generated (C-Corp):**
1. **Articles of Incorporation** — filed with Secretary of State
2. **Bylaws** — internal governance rules
3. **Action of Incorporator** — appoints initial board
4. **Organizational Resolutions** — board adopts bylaws, elects officers, authorizes stock
5. **Stock Ledger** — records all share ownership + voting power summary
6. **Filing Checklist** — step-by-step guide with links, 83(b) deadline tracking, Year 1 compliance calendar, and bank account requirements
7. **83(b) Election Form** *(auto-generated if stock issued for services)* — IRS election to lock in tax basis at par value. Includes instructions + filing checklist. CRITICAL: must be filed within 30 days of stock issuance.
8. **Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (RSPA)** — template for each stockholder receiving shares. Covers vesting, repurchase option, transfer restrictions, 83(b) acknowledgment, spousal consent. ⚠️ Complex arrangements should involve legal review.

**Documents generated (LLC):**
1. **Articles of Organization** — filed with Secretary of State (template: `llc-01-articles-of-organization.md`)
2. **Operating Agreement** — governance, economics, member rights (template: `llc-02-operating-agreement.md`)
3. **Membership Ledger** — records ownership and transfers (template: `llc-03-membership-ledger.md`)
4. **Filing Checklist** — step-by-step guide (template: `llc-04-filing-checklist.md`)

**Delaware C-Corp uses different template for Articles:**
- Use `de-01-certificate-of-incorporation.md` instead of `01-articles-of-incorporation.md`
- Delaware calls it "Certificate of Incorporation" not "Articles"
- Includes exculpation clause (DGCL §102(b)(7)) and blank check preferred authorization
- All other C-Corp documents (Bylaws, Action, Resolutions, Stock Ledger, Checklist) are the same with state-specific adjustments

### Step 4: Format + Deliver

- All text: Times New Roman, black, 12pt headers, 11pt body
- Tables: bordered, alternating row shading, dark blue headers
- Highlight in yellow any fields that still need manual input
- Upload to Google Drive or save as local .docx files
- Link each document from the Filing Checklist

### Step 5: Walk Through Next Steps

After generating docs, brief the user on filing sequence:
1. File Articles with Secretary of State (online if available)
2. File Initial List of Officers (bundled with Articles in Nevada)
3. Sign Action of Incorporator (after filing confirmed)
4. Hold organizational meeting / sign resolutions
5. Issue stock / record in ledger
6. **File 83(b) elections within 30 days** — every stockholder receiving shares for services (see state reference for details)
7. Obtain EIN from IRS (note: non-US founders need a US-based officer with SSN to apply online)
8. Execute Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements (RSPAs) with all stockholders
9. Open corporate bank account (bring: EIN, filed Articles, Bylaws, Resolutions, IDs)

## Post-Filing Guide

After documents are generated and filed, read `references/post-filing-learnings.md` for real-world guidance on:
- Actual filing costs (vs. estimates)
- SilverFlume server error handling
- EIN application gotchas (non-US founders)
- 83(b) election 30-day deadline management
- Common mistakes to avoid
- DIY vs. lawyer cost comparison

This file was built from a real Nevada C-Corp filing (March 2026) and captures lessons that aren't in any template.

## Important Notes

- These are standard formation documents, not legal advice
- Complex structures (convertible notes, vesting schedules, multiple preferred series) should involve a lawyer
- State-specific requirements vary — always check the state reference file
- Annual maintenance requirements differ by state — included in checklist
- **Delaware franchise tax** can be very expensive — see `references/delaware-corp.md` for the Assumed Par Value method
- **LLC operating agreements** are highly customizable — the template covers standard provisions but complex arrangements (waterfall distributions, vesting, drag-along rights) need legal review
