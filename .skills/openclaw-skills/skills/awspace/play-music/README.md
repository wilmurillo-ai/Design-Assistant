# 🎵 Play Music Skill

**Controlled music player with pause/resume/stop support**  
Single entry point, background server for full control

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install pygame** (recommended for full control): `pip install pygame`
3. **Place music files** in a `music` folder in the same directory
4. **Make executable**: `chmod +x play-music`
5. **Use**: `./play-music play`

## Single Entry Point

The skill has **one clear entry point**: `./play-music`

### Command Interface
```
./play-music help          - Show this help
./play-music list          - List available songs
./play-music play          - Play default song
./play-music pause         - Pause currently playing music
./play-music resume        - Resume paused music
./play-music stop          - Stop currently playing music
./play-music status        - Show playback status
./play-music <filename>    - Play specific song (e.g., song.mp3)
./play-music server-start  - Start music server manually
./play-music server-stop   - Stop music server
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize the behavior using environment variables:

```bash
# Set custom music directory
export MUSIC_DIR="/path/to/your/music"

# Set default song name
export DEFAULT_SONG="my-favorite-song.mp3"

# Set custom lock file location (optional)
export MUSIC_LOCK_FILE="/tmp/my_music_player.lock"
```

### Default Behavior

- **Music directory**: `./music` (relative to script location)
- **Default song**: `jaychou-sunnyday.mp3` (or set via DEFAULT_SONG)
- **Lock file**: `/tmp/music_player.lock` (for server coordination)

## Examples

```bash
# Play the default song
./play-music play

# Play a specific song
./play-music my-song.mp3

# Control playback
./play-music pause
./play-music resume
./play-music stop

# See what's available
./play-music list

# Use custom music directory
MUSIC_DIR=~/Music ./play-music play

# Set default song and play
DEFAULT_SONG="background-music.mp3" ./play-music play
```

## Features

✅ **Single entry point** - No confusion about which script to use  
✅ **Full playback control** - Play, pause, resume, stop  
✅ **Resource-efficient** - Server auto-starts when needed, auto-stops when music stops  
✅ **Clean architecture** - Client-server separation  
✅ **Pygame-based** - High quality audio playback  
✅ **Cross-platform** - macOS/Windows/Linux compatible  
✅ **Configurable** - All paths via environment variables  

## Setup

### 1. Install Pygame (Recommended)
For full pause/resume/stop control:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 2. Add Music Files
Create a `music` folder in the same directory as the script and add your music files:
```bash
mkdir music
cp ~/Music/*.mp3 music/
```

Or use a custom directory:
```bash
export MUSIC_DIR="/path/to/your/music"
```

### 3. Make Executable
```bash
chmod +x play-music
```

## How It Works

The skill uses a clean client-server architecture:

1. **`play-music`** - Single entry point (Python script combining client functionality)
2. **`music-server.py`** - Background server that handles music playback
3. **Pygame mixer** - For high-quality audio with full control

**Resource-efficient design:** The server auto-starts when you play music and auto-shuts down when you stop music. This saves system resources while maintaining the convenience of the client-server architecture.

## Troubleshooting

**"No music playing" when trying to pause/resume/stop**  
Start playing music first: `./play-music play`

**"Music directory not found"**  
Create the directory: `mkdir music` or set `MUSIC_DIR` environment variable

**"Pygame not installed"**  
Install it: `pip install pygame`

**Server won't start**  
Check if port 12346 is available, or kill existing servers:
```bash
pkill -f "music-server.py"
./play-music server-start
```

**Clean and minimal** - No redundant files, clear structure.
