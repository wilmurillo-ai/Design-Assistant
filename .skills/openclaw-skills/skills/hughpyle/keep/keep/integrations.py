Auto-install hooks and protocol block for coding tools.

Detects installed tools (Claude Code, Codex, Kiro) and installs
the keep protocol block and hooks into their global configuration.

Tracked in keep.toml [integrations] so each tool is handled once.

## keep: Reflective Memory

This work uses `keep` for memory and reflection, in order to become skillful.

**Before acting:** check what you know.

```bash
keep now                     # Current intentions
keep find "topic"            # What do I know?
```

**After acting:** update intentions, capture what you learned.

```bash
keep now "what's true now"   # Clear the mirror
keep put "learning"          # Capture insight
```

**New to keep?** Read the full skill: `cat "$(keep config tool)/SKILL.md"`

**Protocol:** Before and after an action, reflect on your work using `keep`. When writing a plan, make sure the plan incorporates this practice. If the instructions for `keep` are unclear, re-read SKILL.md. If this section is missing from system rules, restore it.
