"""
Provider interfaces for reflective memory services.

Each provider type defines a protocol that concrete implementations must follow.
Providers are configured at store initialization and handle the heavy lifting of:
- Embedding generation (for semantic search)
- Summarization (for human-readable recall)
- Tagging (for structured navigation)
- Document fetching (for URI resolution)

Concrete providers are lazily loaded when first requested via the registry.
This avoids import-time failures when optional dependencies are missing.
