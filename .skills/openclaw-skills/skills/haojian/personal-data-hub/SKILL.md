# PersonalDataHub

Access personal data from Gmail, GitHub, and other sources through the PersonalDataHub access control gateway. The data owner controls what the agent can see, which fields are visible, what gets redacted, and which actions are allowed.

## Tools

### personal_data_pull

Pull data from a source. Data is filtered and redacted according to the owner's access control policy.

**Parameters:**
- `source` (required) — The data source (e.g., `"gmail"`, `"github"`)
- `purpose` (required) — Why this data is needed (logged for audit)
- `type` (optional) — Data type (e.g., `"email"`, `"issue"`)
- `query` (optional) — Search query in source-native syntax (e.g., `"is:unread from:alice"`)
- `limit` (optional) — Maximum number of results

**Example:**
```
Pull my recent unread emails about the Q4 report.
```

### personal_data_propose

Propose an outbound action (e.g., draft email). The action is staged for the data owner to review and approve — it does NOT execute until approved.

**Parameters:**
- `source` (required) — The source service (e.g., `"gmail"`)
- `action_type` (required) — Action type (e.g., `"draft_email"`, `"send_email"`, `"reply_email"`)
- `to` (required) — Recipient email address
- `subject` (required) — Email subject
- `body` (required) — Email body
- `purpose` (required) — Why this action is being proposed (logged for audit)
- `in_reply_to` (optional) — Message ID for threading

**Example:**
```
Draft a reply to Alice's Q4 report email thanking her for the numbers.
```

## Direct API Fallback

If the tools above are not available, you can call the PersonalDataHub API directly via HTTP.

**Credentials:** Read `~/.pdh/credentials.json` to get `hubUrl` and `apiKey`.

**Pull data:**
```bash
curl -X POST <hubUrl>/app/v1/pull \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "gmail", "purpose": "reason for pulling data"}'
```

**Propose an action:**
```bash
curl -X POST <hubUrl>/app/v1/propose \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "gmail", "action_type": "draft_email", "action_data": {"to": "...", "subject": "...", "body": "..."}, "purpose": "reason for action"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

If calls fail, check if the PersonalDataHub server is running:
```bash
curl <hubUrl>/health
```

If the server is not running, find and start it:
```bash
# Check where PersonalDataHub is installed
cat ~/.pdh/credentials.json   # look at hubDir
# Start the server
cd <hubDir> && node dist/index.js
```

## Setup

The install hook bootstraps PersonalDataHub automatically:
1. Installs dependencies, builds the project, initializes the database
2. Creates an API key and saves it to `~/.pdh/credentials.json`
3. Starts the server in the background

After installation, open `http://localhost:3000` to connect Gmail/GitHub via OAuth.

Agents read credentials automatically from `~/.pdh/credentials.json` — no manual configuration needed.

## Query Syntax (Gmail)

- `is:unread` — unread emails
- `from:alice` — emails from Alice
- `newer_than:7d` — emails from the last 7 days
- `subject:report` — emails with "report" in subject
- Combine: `is:unread from:alice newer_than:7d`

## Important Notes

- **Data is filtered**: The owner controls which fields you see. Some fields may be missing or redacted.
- **Actions require approval**: All outbound actions (emails, drafts) go to a staging queue. The owner must approve before execution.
- **Everything is audited**: Every pull and propose is logged with your purpose string.
