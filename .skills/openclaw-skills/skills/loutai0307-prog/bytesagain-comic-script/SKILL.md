# Comic Script

Content creation and optimization assistant for drafting, outlining, SEO, scheduling, and repurposing content — all from the terminal.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `comic-script draft <topic> [words]` | Create a content draft (default 800 words) |
| `comic-script headline <topic>` | Generate headline variations for a topic |
| `comic-script outline <topic>` | Produce a structured content outline (Intro → Problem → Solution → Examples → CTA) |
| `comic-script seo <keyword>` | Get SEO tips: keywords, title tags, meta descriptions, headings, internal links |
| `comic-script schedule` | Generate a weekly content schedule (Mon–Fri) |
| `comic-script hooks` | Suggest opening hooks: question, statistic, story, bold claim, controversy |
| `comic-script cta` | Generate call-to-action ideas: subscribe, share, comment, try it, learn more |
| `comic-script repurpose` | Suggest content repurposing pipeline: blog → thread → video → carousel → newsletter |
| `comic-script metrics` | List key content metrics: views, clicks, shares, time on page, conversions |
| `comic-script ideas` | Brainstorm content formats: how-to, listicle, case study, interview, comparison |
| `comic-script help` | Show help and all available commands |
| `comic-script version` | Show current version |

## Data Storage

- All activity is logged to `$COMIC_SCRIPT_DIR` (defaults to `~/.local/share/comic-script/`)
- History log: `$DATA_DIR/history.log` — timestamped record of every command executed
- Override the storage directory by setting the `COMIC_SCRIPT_DIR` environment variable

## Requirements

- Bash 4+ (uses `set -euo pipefail`)
- No external dependencies or API keys required
- Runs without internet, entirely local

## When to Use

1. **Drafting content quickly** — Kick off a blog post or article draft with a target word count directly from the terminal
2. **Generating headline ideas** — Brainstorm multiple headline variations for a topic before committing to one
3. **Building content outlines** — Get a structured five-section outline to organize your thoughts before writing
4. **Optimizing for SEO** — Get a checklist of SEO essentials (keywords, meta tags, headings, internal links) for any target keyword
5. **Repurposing existing content** — Plan how to turn a single blog post into a thread, video, carousel, and newsletter

## Examples

```bash
# Create a draft about AI productivity tools (default 800 words)
comic-script draft "AI productivity tools"

# Create a longer draft with a custom word count
comic-script draft "remote work tips" 1500

# Generate headline options for a topic
comic-script headline "machine learning for beginners"

# Get a structured outline
comic-script outline "how to start a newsletter"

# SEO checklist for a keyword
comic-script seo "best project management tools"

# Suggest opening hooks for content
comic-script hooks

# Plan content repurposing
comic-script repurpose
```

## How It Works

Each command outputs structured suggestions to stdout and logs the action with a timestamp to `history.log`. The tool is designed as a quick-reference content companion — run a command, get ideas, and move on with your writing workflow.

## Tips

- Combine commands in a pipeline: run `outline` first, then `draft`, then `seo` to build a full content workflow
- Use `schedule` to plan your content week and `metrics` to decide what to track
- All output is plain text — easy to pipe, redirect, or paste into any editor
- Run `comic-script help` for the complete command list at any time
