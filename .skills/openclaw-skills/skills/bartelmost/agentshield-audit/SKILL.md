# AgentShield - Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents

**The trust layer for the agent economy. Like SSL/TLS, but for AI agents.**

🔐 **Cryptographic Identity** - Ed25519 signing keys  
🤝 **Trust Handshake Protocol** - Mutual verification before communication  
📋 **Public Trust Registry** - Reputation scores & track records  
✅ **77 Security Tests** - Comprehensive vulnerability assessment

**🔒 Privacy Disclosure:** See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for detailed data handling information.

## 🎯 The Problem

Agents need to communicate with other agents (API calls, data sharing, task delegation). But **how do you know if another agent is trustworthy?**

- Has it been compromised?
- Is it leaking data?
- Can you trust its responses?

Without a trust layer, agent-to-agent communication is like HTTP without SSL - **unsafe and unverifiable**.

---

## 💡 The Solution: Trust Infrastructure

AgentShield provides the **trust layer** for agent-to-agent communication:

### 1. Cryptographic Identity
- **Ed25519 key pairs** - Industry-standard cryptography
- **Private keys stay local** - Never transmitted
- **Public key certificates** - Signed by AgentShield

### 2. Security Audit (77 Tests)
**52 Live Attack Vectors:**
Tests defense against instruction manipulation, encoding schemes, and social engineering
across 6 languages. All attack patterns are stored locally in agentshield_attack_patterns.json
(not embedded in documentation).

**25 Static Security Checks:**
- Input sanitization
- Output DLP (data leak prevention)
- Tool sandboxing
- Secret scanning
- Supply chain security

**Result:** Security score (0-100) + Tier (VULNERABLE → HARDENED)

**Privacy:** Tests run 100% locally - only pass/fail scores sent to API (no prompts/responses)

### 3. Trust Handshake Protocol
**Agent A wants to communicate with Agent B:**

```bash
# Step 1: Both agents get certified
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto

# Step 2: Agent A initiates handshake with Agent B
python3 handshake.py --target agent_B_id

# Step 3: Both agents sign challenges
# (Automatic in v1.0.13+)

# Step 4: Receive shared session key
# → Now you can communicate securely!
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Mutual verification (both agents are who they claim to be)
- ✅ Shared session key (for encrypted communication)
- ✅ Trust score boost (+5 for successful handshakes)
- ✅ Public track record (handshake history)

### 4. Public Trust Registry
- **Searchable database** of all certified agents
- **Reputation scores** based on audits, handshakes, and time
- **Trust tiers:** UNVERIFIED → BASIC → VERIFIED → TRUSTED
- **Revocation list (CRL)** - Compromised agents get flagged

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install
```bash
clawhub install agentshield

# Install Python dependencies (required!)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/agentshield*/
```

### Get Certified (77 Security Tests)
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Dry-run first (see what would be submitted)
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto --dry-run

# After verifying payload: Run for real
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto

# Or manual (no file reads):
python3 initiate_audit.py --name "MyAgent" --platform telegram
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Agent ID: `agent_xxxxx`
- ✅ Security Score: XX/100
- ✅ Tier: PATTERNS_CLEAN / HARDENED / etc.
- ✅ Certificate (90-day validity)

### Verify Another Agent
```bash
python3 verify_peer.py agent_yyyyy
```

### Trust Handshake with Another Agent
```bash
# Initiate handshake
python3 handshake.py --target agent_yyyyy

# Result: Shared session key for encrypted communication
```

---

## 📋 Use Cases

### 1. Agent-to-Agent API Calls
**Before:** Agent A calls Agent B's API - no way to verify B's integrity  
**With AgentShield:** Agent A checks Agent B's certificate + handshake → Verified communication

### 2. Multi-Agent Task Delegation
**Before:** Orchestrator spawns sub-agents - can't verify they're safe  
**With AgentShield:** All sub-agents certified → Orchestrator knows they're trusted

### 3. Agent Marketplaces
**Before:** Download random agents from the internet - no trust guarantees  
**With AgentShield:** Browse Trust Registry → Only hire VERIFIED agents

### 4. Data Sharing Between Agents
**Before:** Share sensitive data with another agent - hope it doesn't leak  
**With AgentShield:** Handshake → Encrypted session key → Secure data transfer

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Privacy-First Design

✅ **All 77 tests run locally** - Your system prompts NEVER leave your device  
✅ **Private keys stay local** - Only public keys transmitted  
✅ **Human-in-the-Loop** - Explicit consent before reading IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md  
✅ **No environment scanning** - Doesn't scan for API tokens  

**What goes to the server:**
- Public key (Ed25519)
- Agent name & platform
- Test scores (passed/failed summary)

**What stays local:**
- Private key
- System prompts
- Configuration files
- Detailed test results

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
AGENTSHIELD_API=https://agentshield.live  # API endpoint
AGENT_NAME=MyAgent                        # Override auto-detection
OPENCLAW_AGENT_NAME=MyAgent               # OpenClaw standard
```

## 🌐 Trust Handshake Protocol (Technical)

### Flow
1. **Initiate:** Agent A → Server: "I want to handshake with Agent B"
2. **Challenge:** Server generates random challenges for both agents
3. **Sign:** Both agents sign their challenges with private keys
4. **Verify:** Server verifies signatures with public keys
5. **Complete:** Server generates shared session key
6. **Trust Boost:** Both agents +5 trust score

### Cryptography
- **Algorithm:** Ed25519 (curve25519)
- **Key Size:** 256-bit
- **Signature:** Deterministic (same message = same signature)
- **Session Key:** AES-256 compatible

---

python3 initiate_audit.py --auto

# 2. Handshake with another agent
python3 handshake.py --target agent_xxxxx

# 3. Verify others
python3 verify_peer.py agent_yyyyy
```

## 🔒 Data Transmission Transparency

### What Gets Sent to AgentShield API

**During Audit Submission:**
```json
{
  "agent_name": "YourAgent",
  "platform": "telegram",
  "public_key": "base64_encoded_ed25519_public_key",
  "test_results": {
    "score": 85,
    "tests_passed": 74,
    "tests_total": 77,
    "tier": "PATTERNS_CLEAN",
    "failed_tests": ["test_name_1", "test_name_2"]
  }
}
```

**What is NOT sent:**
- ❌ Full test output/logs
- ❌ Your prompts or system messages
- ❌ IDENTITY.md or SOUL.md file contents
- ❌ Private keys (stay in `~/.agentshield/agent.key`)
- ❌ Workspace files or memory

**API Endpoint:**
- Primary: `https://agentshield.live/api` (proxies to Heroku backend)
- All traffic over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)

---

## 🛡️ Consent & Privacy

**File Read Consent (v1.0.30+):**
1. ✅ Explicit consent prompt BEFORE reading IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md
2. User sees: "🔐 PRIVACY CONSENT - Read IDENTITY.md for agent name? [Y/n]"
3. If declined: Exits with message "Please run with: --name 'YourAgentName'"
4. If approved: Only name/platform extracted (not full file content)

**⚠️ Automation Mode (--yes flag) - v1.0.31+:**

The `--yes` flag is designed for **CI/CD and pre-audited environments ONLY**.

**When to use:**
- ✅ Sandboxed test agents (no real secrets)
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines (after manual code review + dry-run)
- ✅ Agents you've already audited manually

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Production agents with real secrets
- ❌ Agents handling sensitive user data
- ❌ First-time audit (always use manual mode first!)

**Why?** The --yes flag bypasses ALL consent prompts. While the code includes 
explicit sanitization (see audit_client.py line 108+), we recommend:

1. Run `--dry-run` first to inspect payload
2. Manually review audit_client.py whitelist
3. Only then use `--yes` for automation

**Best Practice:**
```bash
# Step 1: Dry-run to see payload
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto --dry-run

# Step 2: Review output, verify sanitization
# (Should only show test IDs + pass/fail, no payloads)

# Step 3: If satisfied, run for real
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto

# Step 4: For CI/CD, add --yes ONLY after manual verification
python3 initiate_audit.py --auto --yes
```

**Privacy-First Mode:**
```bash
export AGENTSHIELD_NO_AUTO_DETECT=1
python initiate_audit.py --name "MyBot" --platform "telegram"
```
→ Zero file reads, manual input only
