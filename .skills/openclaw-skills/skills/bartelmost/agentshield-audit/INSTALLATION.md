# AgentShield Audit - Installation Guide

## 📦 ClawHub Installation (Recommended)

### One-Command Install

```bash
clawhub install agentshield-audit
```

That's it! The skill will be installed to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/agentshield-audit/`

### First Run

After installation, run your first audit:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/agentshield-audit

The script will:
1. Auto-detect your agent name and platform
2. Generate an Ed25519 keypair (stored locally)
3. Run security audit (~30 seconds)
4. Save your signed certificate
