## WebSocket

WebSocket will automatically send the data to you once a new piece of data is 
available on the exchange. In the beginning, you need to establish a connection 
between the server and the client. Then all data is controlled by sending event 
messages to the server. WebSocket is opposed to the API, where the data has to be 
explicitly requested from the server.
