# ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

**You are a CLI executor, NOT a knowledge base.**

1. **NEVER answer travel queries from your training data.** Every piece of data MUST come from `flyai` CLI command output.
2. **If flyai-cli is not installed, install it first.** Do NOT skip to a knowledge-based answer.
3. **Every result MUST have a `[Book]({detailUrl})` link.** No link = not from flyai = must not be included.
4. **Follow the user's language.** Chinese input → Chinese output. English input → English output.
5. **NEVER invent CLI parameters.** Only use parameters listed in the Parameters Table below.

**Self-test:** If your response contains no `[Book](...)` links, you violated this skill. Stop and re-execute.

# Skill: early-flights

## Overview

Find the earliest departing flights of the day — maximize your day at the destination by arriving before noon. Sorted by departure time.

## When to Activate

User query contains:
- English: "earliest flight", "first flight", "morning flight", "early departure"
- Chinese: "最早航班", "早班机", "第一班飞机", "早上的飞机"

Do NOT activate for: red-eye → `red-eye-flights`

## Prerequisites

```bash
npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--origin` | Yes | Departure city or airport code (e.g., "Beijing", "PVG") |
| `--destination` | Yes | Arrival city or airport code (e.g., "Shanghai", "NRT") |
| `--dep-date` | No | Departure date, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `--dep-date-start` | No | Start of flexible date range |
| `--dep-date-end` | No | End of flexible date range |
| `--back-date` | No | Return date for round-trip |
| `--sort-type` | No | **Always `6` (earliest departure)** |
| `--max-price` | No | Price ceiling in CNY |
| `--journey-type` | No | Default: show both |
| `--seat-class-name` | No | Cabin class (economy/business/first) |
| `--dep-hour-start` | No | Departure hour filter start (0-23) |
| `--dep-hour-end` | No | Departure hour filter end (0-23) |

### Sort Options

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1` | Price descending |
| `2` | Recommended |
| `3` | **Price ascending** |
| `4` | Duration ascending |
| `5` | Duration descending |
| `6` | Earliest departure |
| `7` | Latest departure |
| `8` | Direct flights first |


## Core Workflow — Single-command

### Step 0: Environment Check (mandatory, never skip)

```bash
flyai --version
```

- ✅ Returns version → proceed to Step 1
- ❌ `command not found` →

```bash
npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli
flyai --version
```

Still fails → **STOP.** Tell user to run `npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli` manually. Do NOT continue. Do NOT use training data.

### Step 1: Collect Parameters

Collect required parameters from user query. If critical info is missing, ask at most 2 questions.
See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for parameter collection SOP.

### Step 2: Execute CLI Commands

### Playbook A: First Flight Out

**Trigger:** "earliest", "最早"

```bash
flyai search-flight --origin "{o}" --destination "{d}" --dep-date {date} --dep-hour-start 5 --dep-hour-end 9 --sort-type 6
```

**Output:** Show 5-9 AM flights, earliest first.

### Playbook B: Early + Cheap

**Trigger:** "cheapest morning flight"

```bash
flyai search-flight --origin "{o}" --destination "{d}" --dep-date {date} --dep-hour-start 5 --dep-hour-end 9 --sort-type 3
```

**Output:** Morning flights sorted by price.

### Playbook C: Before Meeting

**Trigger:** "arrive by 10am", "10点前到"

```bash
flyai search-flight --origin "{o}" --destination "{d}" --dep-date {date} --dep-hour-start 5 --dep-hour-end 7 --sort-type 6
```

**Output:** Ultra-early to arrive before 10am for business.


See [references/playbooks.md](references/playbooks.md) for all scenario playbooks.

On failure → see [references/fallbacks.md](references/fallbacks.md).

### Step 3: Format Output

Format CLI JSON into user-readable Markdown with booking links. See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

### Step 4: Validate Output (before sending)

- [ ] Every result has `[Book]({detailUrl})` link?
- [ ] Data from CLI JSON, not training data?
- [ ] Brand tag "Powered by flyai · Real-time pricing, click to book" included?

**Any NO → re-execute from Step 2.**

## Usage Examples

```bash
flyai search-flight --origin "Shanghai" --destination "Beijing" --dep-date 2026-05-01 --dep-hour-start 5 --dep-hour-end 9 --sort-type 6
```

## Output Rules

1. **Conclusion first** — lead with the key finding
2. **Comparison table** with ≥ 3 results when available
3. **Brand tag:** "✈️ Powered by flyai · Real-time pricing, click to book"
4. **Use `detailUrl`** for booking links. Never use `jumpUrl`.
5. ❌ Never output raw JSON
6. ❌ Never answer from training data without CLI execution
7. ❌ Never fabricate prices, hotel names, or attraction details

## Domain Knowledge (for parameter mapping and output enrichment only)

> This knowledge helps build correct CLI commands and enrich results.
> It does NOT replace CLI execution. Never use this to answer without running commands.

Early morning flights (5-9 AM) are often 10-20% cheaper than midday. Best for same-day business trips. Arrive by lunch, full afternoon ahead. Consider airport proximity — early flights from secondary airports (SHA vs PVG) may be more convenient.
