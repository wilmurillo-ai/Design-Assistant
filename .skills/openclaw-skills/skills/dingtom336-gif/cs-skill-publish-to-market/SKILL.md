# CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

**You are a CLI executor, NOT a knowledge base.**

1. **NEVER skip credential verification.** Every publish MUST start by testing the user's token.
2. **NEVER fabricate publish results.** Every PR URL, version ID, and slug MUST come from actual API responses.
3. **If curl is not available, stop immediately.** Do NOT simulate publishing.
4. **Follow the user's language.** Chinese input -> Chinese output. English input -> English output. All curl commands and parameters remain in English.
5. **NEVER skip the Quality Gate.** Every skill MUST pass Level 1 checks before publishing.

**Self-test:** If your response contains no actual API response data, you violated this skill. Stop and re-execute.

# Skill: publish-to-market

## Overview

One-command skill publishing to 4 platforms. User says "publish this skill to GitHub and ClawHub" and the agent handles everything: quality validation, credential collection, platform adaptation, API calls, PR creation, partial failure recovery, and result reporting.

## When to Activate

**Chinese triggers:**
- "发布技能", "上传技能", "推送到市场", "发布到GitHub", "发布到ClawHub"
- "批量发布技能", "提交skill PR"

**English triggers:**
- "publish skill", "upload skill", "push to market", "submit PR", "deploy skill"
- "push to ClawHub", "push to GitHub", "publish to market"

**Anti-triggers -- do NOT activate for:**
- Creating new skills -> use `skill-architect`
- Evaluating skill quality -> use `skill-scorer`
- Installing skills locally -> use manual copy or `clawhub install`
- Editing skill content -> use skill editor

## Prerequisites

```bash
curl --version
```

No additional installation needed. This skill uses `curl` to call REST APIs directly.

## Credentials

The agent must collect these credentials before publishing. Ask the user if not provided.

| Credential | Platforms | How to Get |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| GitHub PAT | Anthropic Skills, ECC Community, skills.sh | github.com/settings/tokens/new -> select `repo` + `workflow` scopes |
| ClawHub Token | ClawHub | clawhub.ai -> Settings -> API Tokens -> Create Token (starts with `clh_`) |

**Credential tutorial (show when user doesn't know how to get tokens):**

### GitHub PAT:
1. Open https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Note: "Skill Publisher"
3. Expiration: 90 days (recommended)
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full) + `workflow`
5. Click "Generate token" -> copy immediately (shown only once)

### ClawHub Token:
1. Open https://clawhub.ai and log in
2. Go to Settings -> API Tokens
3. Click "Create Token", name it "skill-publish"
4. Copy the token (starts with `clh_`)

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `skill_path` | Yes | Path to the skill directory (must contain SKILL.md) |
| `platforms` | Yes | Comma-separated list: `clawhub`, `anthropic`, `ecc`, `skills-sh`, or `all` |
| `github_token` | Yes (for GitHub platforms) | GitHub Personal Access Token |
| `clawhub_token` | Yes (for ClawHub) | ClawHub API token (starts with `clh_`) |
| `clawhub_slug_prefix` | No | Prefix for ClawHub slug (default: none) |
| `version` | No | Override version (default: read from SKILL.md frontmatter) |

## Core Workflow

### Step 0: Environment Check

```bash
# Verify curl is available
curl --version > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "ERROR: curl not found"
```

### Step 1: Collect & Verify Credentials

**1a. Ask user for target platforms:**
"Which platforms do you want to publish to? (clawhub / anthropic / ecc / skills-sh / all)"

**1b. Collect required tokens based on selection:**
- If any GitHub platform selected -> ask for GitHub PAT (if not provided)
- If ClawHub selected -> ask for ClawHub token (if not provided)

**1c. Verify tokens:**

```bash
# Test GitHub token
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/user | grep -o '"login":"[^"]*"'
# Expected: "login":"username"

# Test ClawHub token
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {CLAWHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/whoami | grep -o '"handle":"[^"]*"'
# Expected: "handle":"username"
```

If verification fails -> show error, ask user to check token, do NOT proceed.

### Step 2: Quality Gate

Run a three-level quality check on the skill before publishing. This prevents broken or incomplete skills from reaching the market.

**Level 1 -- Hard Stop (MUST pass to continue):**
- [ ] SKILL.md file exists in the skill directory
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is present and parseable
- [ ] Frontmatter contains `name` field (non-empty string)
- [ ] Frontmatter contains `description` field (non-empty string)
- [ ] Frontmatter contains `version` field (valid semver format)

If ANY Level 1 check fails -> STOP. Show the failure and do NOT proceed to publishing.

**Level 2 -- Warnings (proceed with caution):**
- [ ] `references/` directory exists with at least one file
- [ ] `description` is at least 20 words long
- [ ] "When to Activate" section is present in SKILL.md
- [ ] `compatibility` field is present in frontmatter
- [ ] README.md file exists alongside SKILL.md

Show warnings but do NOT block publishing.

**Level 3 -- Advisory (informational score):**

Run a quick 10-point scan based on common anti-patterns:
1. Frontmatter has changelog field
2. Anti-triggers are defined (prevents false activation)
3. Usage examples are included
4. Output format is specified
5. Error handling section exists
6. Domain knowledge section exists
7. References table is present
8. Description mentions concrete use cases
9. Version is above 0.x (indicates maturity)
10. No TODO/FIXME/HACK markers remain in SKILL.md

Each item = 10 points. Total = sum of passing items.

**Output format:**

```
Quality Gate Results:
  Level 1 (Required):  PASS / FAIL
  Level 2 (Warnings):  N warnings (details listed below)
  Level 3 (Advisory):  Score: XX/100

Level 2 warnings:
  - missing references/ directory
  - description is only 12 words (recommend 20+)

Proceed with publishing? (yes / fix first)
```

If Level 1 = FAIL, do not ask -- just stop and show what needs fixing.

### Step 3: Read Skill Files & Adapt for Each Platform

```bash
# Read SKILL.md and extract metadata
SKILL_DIR="{skill_path}"
SKILL_MD=$(cat "$SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md")

# Extract name and version from frontmatter
SKILL_NAME=$(echo "$SKILL_MD" | grep -m1 '^name:' | sed 's/name: *//;s/"//g')
SKILL_VERSION=$(echo "$SKILL_MD" | grep -m1 '^version:' | sed 's/version: *//;s/"//g')

# Find all files to publish
find "$SKILL_DIR" -type f -name "*.md" | sort
```

**Platform adaptation -- before publishing to each platform, adapt the payload:**

| Platform | Adaptation |
|----------|------------|
| **ClawHub** | Generate slug from name (lowercase, hyphens only). Extract `displayName` from slug. Extract tags from frontmatter if present. |
| **Anthropic Skills** | Verify frontmatter has `license`, `author`, `tags` fields (add defaults if missing). File path = `skills/{name}/`. |
| **ECC Community** | File path = `skills/{name}/`. PR body uses standardized format with skill description and version. |
| **skills.sh** | File path = `{name}/`. Subdirectory prefix required for all uploaded files. |

### Step 4: Publish to Selected Platforms

Execute in reliability order. Each platform is independent -- one failure does not block others.

#### 4a. ClawHub (HTTP API -- fastest, most reliable)

```bash
# Build multipart form data
curl -X POST "https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {CLAWHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -F "payload={\"slug\":\"{SLUG_PREFIX}{SKILL_NAME}\",\"displayName\":\"{DISPLAY_NAME}\",\"version\":\"{VERSION}\",\"changelog\":\"\",\"acceptLicenseTerms\":true,\"tags\":[\"latest\"]}" \
  -F "files=@{SKILL_DIR}/SKILL.md;filename=SKILL.md" \
  -F "files=@{SKILL_DIR}/references/templates.md;filename=references/templates.md" \
  -F "files=@{SKILL_DIR}/references/playbooks.md;filename=references/playbooks.md" \
  -F "files=@{SKILL_DIR}/references/fallbacks.md;filename=references/fallbacks.md" \
  -F "files=@{SKILL_DIR}/references/runbook.md;filename=references/runbook.md"
```

**Version conflict handling:** If response contains "Version already exists", bump patch version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1) and retry up to 3 times.

#### 4b. skills.sh (GitHub File Upload)

Target repo configured by user or default `skills-sh/registry`, upload SKILL.md with subdirectory prefix `{SKILL_NAME}/`.

#### 4c. Anthropic Skills (GitHub PR)

Target repo: `anthropics/skills`

```bash
# 1. Get authenticated user
GH_USER=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  https://api.github.com/user | grep -o '"login":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

# 2. Fork the repo (idempotent)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/skills/forks
sleep 3

# 3. Get default branch SHA
BASE_SHA=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_USER/skills/git/ref/heads/main \
  | grep -o '"sha":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

# 4. Create branch
BRANCH="add-skill-{SKILL_NAME}-$(date +%s)"
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_USER/skills/git/refs \
  -d "{\"ref\":\"refs/heads/$BRANCH\",\"sha\":\"$BASE_SHA\"}"

# 5. Upload each file (base64 encoded)
for FILE in SKILL.md references/templates.md references/playbooks.md references/fallbacks.md references/runbook.md; do
  if [ -f "$SKILL_DIR/$FILE" ]; then
    CONTENT=$(base64 < "$SKILL_DIR/$FILE")
    FILEPATH="skills/{SKILL_NAME}/$FILE"
    curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
      "https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_USER/skills/contents/$FILEPATH" \
      -d "{\"message\":\"Add $FILE for skill: {SKILL_NAME}\",\"content\":\"$CONTENT\",\"branch\":\"$BRANCH\"}"
  fi
done

# 6. Create PR
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/skills/pulls \
  -d "{\"title\":\"Add skill: {SKILL_NAME}\",\"head\":\"$GH_USER:$BRANCH\",\"base\":\"main\",\"body\":\"Adding skill **{SKILL_NAME}** v{VERSION} via skill-publish-to-market.\n\nDescription: {DESCRIPTION}\n\nFiles included: SKILL.md + references/\"}"
```

#### 4d. ECC Community (GitHub PR)

Same as 4c but target repo: `affaan-m/everything-claude-code`, path prefix: `skills/{SKILL_NAME}/`

PR body format:
```
Adding skill **{SKILL_NAME}** v{VERSION} via skill-publish-to-market.

Description: {DESCRIPTION}
Compatibility: {COMPATIBILITY}

Files included: SKILL.md + references/
```

### Step 5: Report Results

Output a summary table with partial success handling:

```
Publishing Results: {SKILL_NAME} v{VERSION}

| Platform | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ClawHub | [SUCCESS] | {slug}@{version} |
| skills.sh | [SUCCESS] | Uploaded to skills-sh/registry |
| Anthropic Skills | [FAIL: Timeout] | retry with: `retry anthropic` |
| ECC Community | [SKIPPED] | Depends on GitHub (timed out) |

2/4 platforms succeeded.
```

**Status values:**
- `[SUCCESS]` -- published successfully, show link or slug@version
- `[FAIL: reason]` -- failed with specific error, show retry command
- `[SKIPPED]` -- skipped due to dependency failure or user choice
- `[WARN: reason]` -- succeeded with warnings

### Step 6: Follow-up Loop

After reporting results, offer next actions:

```
Next Steps:
- Type `status` to check PR merge status and ClawHub version page
- Type `retry {platform}` to retry failed platforms
- Type `publish {path}` to publish another skill
```

If the user responds with one of these commands, execute accordingly:
- `status` -> check each PR URL for merge status, check ClawHub version page
- `retry {platform}` -> re-run Step 4 for that specific platform only
- `publish {path}` -> restart from Step 1 with the new path

## Batch Publishing Strategy

When publishing multiple skills at once:

| Skill Count | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| 1 skill | Normal flow (Steps 0-6) |
| 2-5 skills | Sequential execution, show progress after each skill |
| 6+ skills | Batch of 5, pause between batches for user confirmation |

**Batch progress format (2-5 skills):**
```
Batch Progress: 2/3 skills published

| Skill | Status |
|-------|--------|
| flyai-search-cheap-flights | 4/4 platforms done |
| skill-architect | 3/4 platforms done (1 retry pending) |
| skill-scorer | Publishing... |
```

**Batch format (6+ skills):**
```
Batch 1/3 complete (5 skills published).
Start batch 2? (yes / stop)
```

## Usage Examples

### Publish to all platforms
```
User: "请把 ~/.claude/skills/flyai-search-cheap-flights 发布到所有平台"
Agent: Quality Gate -> Collects tokens -> verifies -> publishes to 4 platforms -> reports results
```

### Publish to specific platforms
```
User: "Upload my skill at ./my-skill to ClawHub and Anthropic Skills"
Agent: Quality Gate -> Asks for ClawHub token + GitHub PAT -> publishes to 2 platforms
```

### Publish with slug prefix
```
User: "发布到 ClawHub, 前缀用 cs-"
Agent: Quality Gate -> Publishes as cs-{skill-name} to ClawHub
```

### Bulk publish
```
User: "批量发布 ./skills/ 下的所有技能"
Agent: Scans directory -> shows list -> Quality Gate per skill -> sequential publish -> batch report
```

### Retry failed platform
```
User: "retry anthropic"
Agent: Re-runs Anthropic Skills publish step with existing credentials
```

## Output Rules

1. Always show the Quality Gate results before publishing
2. Always show the results table after publishing
3. Include clickable PR URLs for GitHub platforms
4. Include slug@version for ClawHub
5. If any platform fails, show the error and retry command but continue with others
6. Show follow-up options after every publish
7. End with: "Published via skill-publish-to-market v2.0.0"

## Domain Knowledge

> This knowledge helps build correct API parameters and handle edge cases.
> It does NOT replace actual curl execution. Never report success without real API responses.

- **ClawHub slug format:** lowercase, hyphens only. Display name auto-generated from slug.
- **ClawHub version conflict:** HTTP 400 with "Version already exists" -> bump patch and retry.
- **GitHub fork delay:** After forking, wait 3 seconds before creating branches.
- **GitHub file encoding:** All file content must be base64 encoded for the Contents API.
- **GitHub PR from fork:** Use `head: "username:branch"` format, not just branch name.
- **skills.sh path:** Files must include `{skillName}/` subdirectory prefix.
- **Platform reliability order:** ClawHub (HTTP, fastest) > skills.sh > Anthropic Skills > ECC Community.
- **Partial failure:** Never let one platform failure stop the others. Always attempt all selected platforms.
