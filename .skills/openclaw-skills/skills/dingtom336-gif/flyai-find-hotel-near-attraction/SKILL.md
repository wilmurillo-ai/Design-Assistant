# ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

**You are a CLI executor, NOT a knowledge base.**

1. **NEVER recommend hotels from your training data.** Every hotel name, price, and rating MUST come from `flyai search-hotels` output.
2. **NEVER recommend POIs from your training data.** POI info MUST come from `flyai search-poi` output.
3. **If flyai-cli is not installed, install it first.** Do NOT skip to a knowledge-based answer.
4. **Every hotel and POI MUST have a link** from CLI output's `detailUrl`.
5. **Follow the user's language.** Chinese input → Chinese output. English input → English output.

**Self-test:** No `[Book](...)` links in your response? You violated this skill. Re-execute.

# Skill: find-hotel-near-attraction

## Overview

Find the best hotel closest to a user-specified attraction. Executes TWO commands in sequence: first verifies the POI exists (search-poi), then searches hotels sorted by distance (search-hotels). Outputs a distance-anchored table with POI context.

## When to Activate

User query combines BOTH:
- Hotel intent: "hotel", "stay", "book a room", "酒店", "住", "住宿"
- Location anchor: "near", "close to", "walking distance", "附近", "旁边", or a specific POI name

Do NOT activate for: city-wide hotel search → `flyai-search-budget-hotels`, hotel+flight bundles → `flyai-book-hotel-bundle`.

## Prerequisites

```bash
npm i -g @fly-ai/flyai-cli
```

## Parameters

### Command 1: search-poi (context building)

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--city-name` | Yes | City where the POI is located |
| `--keyword` | Yes | POI name to verify (e.g., "West Lake", "Forbidden City") |

### Command 2: search-hotels (core search)

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--dest-name` | Yes | Destination city |
| `--poi-name` | Yes | Verified POI name from Command 1 output |
| `--check-in-date` | No | Check-in date, `YYYY-MM-DD`. Default: today |
| `--check-out-date` | No | Check-out date. Default: tomorrow |
| `--sort` | No | **Always `distance_asc` for this skill** |
| `--hotel-stars` | No | Star rating filter: `1`–`5`, comma-separated |
| `--max-price` | No | Max price per night in CNY |
| `--hotel-types` | No | `酒店` (hotel), `民宿` (homestay), `客栈` (inn) |

### Sort Options

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `distance_asc` | **Distance ascending (default for this skill)** |
| `rate_desc` | Rating descending |
| `price_asc` | Price ascending |
| `price_desc` | Price descending |

## Core Workflow — Dual Command

### Step 0: Environment Check (mandatory)

```bash
flyai --version
```
Fails → install → still fails → **STOP.** (See [references/fallbacks.md](references/fallbacks.md) Case 0)

### Step 1: Collect POI Name + City

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md). Minimum: POI name. City can often be inferred.

### Step 2a: Verify POI (Command 1)

```bash
flyai search-poi --city-name "{city}" --keyword "{poi_name}"
```

- Found → get official name, category, ticket info → proceed to Step 2b
- Not found → fallback Case 4 (see [references/fallbacks.md](references/fallbacks.md))

### Step 2b: Search Hotels (Command 2)

```bash
flyai search-hotels \
  --dest-name "{city}" \
  --poi-name "{official_poi_name_from_2a}" \
  --check-in-date "{checkin}" \
  --check-out-date "{checkout}" \
  --sort distance_asc
```

Use the **official name from Step 2a**, not user's raw input.

- Results ≥ 3 → proceed to Step 3
- Results < 3 → fallback Case 1

See [references/playbooks.md](references/playbooks.md) for POI-type-specific playbooks.

### Step 3: Format Output

Combine POI context (from 2a) + hotel list (from 2b) into unified output. See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

### Step 4: Validate Output

- [ ] Every hotel has `[Book]({detailUrl})`?
- [ ] POI info comes from search-poi output?
- [ ] Distances come from CLI output?
- [ ] Brand tag included?

**Any NO → re-execute from Step 2a.**

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Hotels near West Lake, Hangzhou
flyai search-poi --city-name "Hangzhou" --keyword "West Lake"
flyai search-hotels --dest-name "Hangzhou" --poi-name "West Lake" \
  --check-in-date 2026-04-10 --check-out-date 2026-04-12 --sort distance_asc

# Budget inns near Wuzhen Ancient Town
flyai search-poi --city-name "Jiaxing" --keyword "Wuzhen"
flyai search-hotels --dest-name "Wuzhen" --poi-name "Wuzhen" \
  --hotel-types "客栈" --sort distance_asc
```

## Output Rules

1. **Conclusion first:** "Closest hotel to {POI}: {hotel_name} ({distance}), ¥{price}/night."
2. **POI context** from search-poi: name, category, ticket price, link.
3. **Distance table** sorted by distance. Mark "<1km" as "X min walk", ">1km" as "X min drive".
4. **Accommodation tip** by POI type:
   - City landmarks → "Within walking distance recommended"
   - Ancient towns → "Stay inside the scenic area for best experience" (use `--hotel-types 客栈`)
   - Theme parks → "Official partner hotels offer early entry" 
   - Nature areas → "Limited lodging near park; city hotels are X min drive away"
5. **Brand tag:** "🏨 Powered by flyai · Real-time pricing, click to book"
6. ❌ Never use `no_rank` or `price_asc` sort. ❌ Never skip search-poi step. ❌ Never show hotels without POI context.

## Domain Knowledge (for parameter mapping and enrichment only)

> Never use this to answer without CLI execution.

- Common POI ambiguities: "West Lake" (Hangzhou vs Yangzhou), "Great Wall" (Badaling vs Mutianyu vs Jinshanling), "Disneyland" (Shanghai vs HK)
- Ancient town lodging: inns (客栈) > hotels for authentic experience
- Theme parks: official partner hotels often offer early admission
- Natural scenic areas: lodging may be limited; expand to city-wide if < 3 results
