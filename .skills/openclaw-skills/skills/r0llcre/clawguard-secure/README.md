# ClawGuard Security Assistant

Security assistant skill that helps you understand and act on [ClawGuard](https://clawguardsecurity.ai) scan reports — parsing, explaining, impact analysis, and guided remediation.

## What It Does

- **Reads and summarizes** exported JSON/Markdown scan reports
- **Explains findings** in clear, causal-chain language — deeper than the web UI
- **Analyzes fix impact** — checks whether a fix will break your existing skills or hooks
- **Guides remediation** — shows diffs, creates backups, applies fixes with your confirmation
- **Guides you through scanning** on clawguardsecurity.ai if you don't have a report yet

## Install

**From ClawHub:**

```bash
clawhub install clawguard-secure
```

**Manual:**

Copy this repo into your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R0llcre/clawguard-skill.git ~/.openclaw/skills/clawguard-secure
```

Then start a new OpenClaw session.

## Usage

Just talk to your OpenClaw agent naturally:

- "Help me check my OpenClaw security"
- "Read this report ~/Downloads/clawguard-report.json"
- "What does OC-001 mean?"
- "Will fixing this break my Slack integration?"
- "Fix OC-001 for me"
- "Compare my old and new scan reports"
