# surf-check

Checks surf forecasts and tells you when conditions are worth paddling out.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd {baseDir} && npm install
npm run check
```

## Commands

Run from the skill directory:

```bash
cd {baseDir} && npm run check
```

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run check` | User asks about surf conditions |
| `npm run check:debug` | Debugging why a day did/didn't qualify |
| `npm run check:json` | When you need structured data |
| `npm run check:cron` | Automated checks (cron job uses this) |

## Sample Output

```
🏄 **Surf Forecast Summary**

**Belmar (16th Ave)**
• Saturday: 2-3ft (Fair)

**Long Branch**
• Saturday: 2-3ft (Fair)
```

If nothing meets thresholds, output is empty (cron mode) or shows "No surfable conditions in the forecast."

## Decision Thresholds

| Days Out | Minimum Rating | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| 4+ days | Fair-Good+ | Forecasts are fuzzy, need high confidence |
| 1-3 days | Fair+ | Sweet spot for planning |
| Day of | Good+ (before 8am) | Only if it's actually firing |

Wave height: 2-6ft (configured in `src/types.ts`)

## Your Job

When conditions are surfable:
1. **Summarize naturally** — "Looks like Saturday could be good at Belmar, 2-3ft and Fair conditions"
2. **Include the day and spot** — user needs to know when and where
3. **Don't over-explain the ratings** — surfers know what Fair/Good means

When user asks about surf:
- Run `npm run check` and summarize the output
- If nothing's showing up, check `npm run check:debug` to see why

## Configuration

Default spots: Belmar (16th Ave), Long Branch (NJ)

To customize, create `~/.surf-check.json`:

```json
{
  "spots": [
    { "id": "5842041f4e65fad6a7708a01", "name": "My Local Break" }
  ],
  "waveMin": 2,
  "waveMax": 6
}
```

Find spot IDs from Surfline URLs:
```
https://www.surfline.com/surf-report/spot-name/5842041f4e65fad6a7708a01
                                              └── spot ID
```

## OpenClaw Cron Integration

```json
{
  "name": "surf-check",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 */6 * * *", "tz": "America/New_York" },
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "Run: cd {baseDir} && npm run check:cron"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "main"
}
```

When cron fires:
- You receive output as a system event
- Only *new* conditions are shown (state tracking prevents duplicates)
- If output is empty, nothing qualified or already reported

## Troubleshooting

**No output from cron:** Normal if nothing qualifies or already reported. Run `npm run check:debug` to see evaluation.

**Reset state:** `rm {baseDir}/data/state.json` to re-report all conditions.

**Add a spot:** Edit `src/types.ts` or use `~/.surf-check.json` config.
