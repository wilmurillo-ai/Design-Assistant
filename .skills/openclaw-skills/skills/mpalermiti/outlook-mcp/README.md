## What This Enables

Give your AI agent full Outlook access. Example prompts that just work:

- *"Summarize my unread email from the past 24 hours and flag anything time-sensitive."*
- *"What's in my Focused Inbox right now? Anything in Other that looks like it belongs up top?"*
- *"Any shipping updates in my inbox? Track what I'm waiting on and when it's supposed to arrive."*
- *"Scan my email for upcoming subscription renewals — what's about to auto-charge in the next two weeks?"*
- *"I've got a trip to Seattle next week — check my calendar for the itinerary and create a To Do task with a packing checklist."*
- *"Draft a reply to the last message from my sister saying I'll call her this weekend."*
- *"Move all newsletter and promotional email from this week to a 'Read Later' folder — batch 20 at a time."*

The server exposes 52 discrete tools so the agent can compose its own workflow — read, triage, write, schedule, track tasks — without hardcoded macros.

## Works With

- **[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** — native MCP support, available via [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/skills?q=outlook-mcp)
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — add to `~/.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)** — MCP-compatible
- **Any MCP client** — it's a standard stdio MCP server

Listed on the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=mpalermiti) as `io.github.mpalermiti/outlook-mcp`.

## Features

**52 tools** across 13 categories:

- **Auth (1)** -- auth status check (login is via CLI)
- **Mail Read (4)** -- list inbox (with Focused Inbox filter), read message, search (KQL), list folders
- **Mail Write (3)** -- send, reply/reply-all, forward
- **Mail Triage (6)** -- move, delete (soft by default), flag, categorize, mark read/unread, reclassify (Focused Inbox)
- **Calendar Read (2)** -- list events (with recurring expansion), get event details
- **Calendar Write (4)** -- create, update, delete, RSVP (accept/decline/tentative)
- **Contacts (6)** -- list, search, get, create, update, delete
- **To Do (6)** -- list task lists, list/create/update/complete/delete tasks
- **Drafts (5)** -- list, create, update, send, delete
- **Attachments (3)** -- list, download, send-with-attachments
- **Folder Management (3)** -- create, rename, delete mail folders
- **Threading and Batch (3)** -- list thread, copy message, batch triage
- **User and Admin (6)** -- whoami, list calendars, list categories, mail tips, accounts

**Design principles:**

- **BYOID** -- Bring Your Own ID. You register your own Azure AD app. No shared client ID.
- **Zero telemetry** -- no analytics, no local caching, no third-party calls.
- **Token storage** -- OS keyring via `azure-identity` (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Store, Linux Secret Service).
- **Input validation** -- all inputs validated (email, Graph IDs, OData, KQL, datetimes) before any API call.
- **Read-only mode** -- set `read_only: true` in config to block all write operations.
- **Soft delete** -- delete moves to Deleted Items by default. Hard delete requires explicit `permanent: true`.
- **Timezone-aware** -- calendar operations respect your configured IANA timezone.

## Azure AD App Registration

You need to register a free Azure AD app to get a client ID.

### Prerequisites (Personal Microsoft Accounts)

Microsoft has deprecated app registration for personal accounts without an Azure AD tenant. You need to create a free Azure account first:

1. Go to [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) and sign up with your personal `@outlook.com` account. Requires a credit card for identity verification but **won't charge you**. This creates a proper Azure AD tenant.

### Register the App

1. Go to [App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) and sign in with your `@outlook.com` account.

2. Click **"+ New registration"** and fill in:
   - **Name:** anything except Microsoft-branded terms (e.g. `mp-outlook-mcp` — names like "Outlook MCP" will be rejected)
   - **Supported account types:** select **"Personal Microsoft accounts only"**
   - **Redirect URI:** leave blank

3. Click **Register**. Copy the **Application (client) ID** from the overview page.

4. Go to **Authentication (Preview)** → **Settings** tab → toggle **"Allow public client flows"** to **Yes** → **Save**.

5. Go to **API permissions** → **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions** → add:
   - `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`
   - `Calendars.ReadWrite`
   - `Contacts.ReadWrite`, `Tasks.ReadWrite`
   - `User.Read`, `offline_access`

No client secret is needed. The device code flow uses public client auth.

## Quick Start

### Install

**Option A — from PyPI (recommended):**

```bash
uv tool install outlook-graph-mcp
# or: pipx install outlook-graph-mcp
# or: pip install outlook-graph-mcp
```

**Option B — from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpalermiti/outlook-mcp.git
cd outlook-mcp
uv sync
```

### Configure

Create `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID",
  "tenant_id": "consumers",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "read_only": true
}
```

The only required field is `client_id`. Everything else has sensible defaults. Start with `read_only: true` — flip to `false` when you're comfortable.

### Register with your MCP client

**If installed from PyPI:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "outlook-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**If installed from source:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/outlook-mcp", "run", "outlook-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For OpenClaw**, use the `openclaw mcp` CLI — it writes to `mcp.servers` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` for you:

```bash
# If installed from PyPI:
openclaw mcp set outlook '{"command":"outlook-mcp"}'

# If installed from source:
openclaw mcp set outlook '{"command":"uv","args":["--directory","/path/to/outlook-mcp","run","outlook-mcp"]}'

# Verify:
openclaw mcp list
openclaw mcp show outlook --json
```

Restart the OpenClaw gateway after registering. See the [OpenClaw MCP docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/mcp) for SSE/HTTP transport variants.

### Authenticate

Run this once on the machine where the MCP server will run:

```bash
uv run outlook-mcp auth
```

You'll get a URL and a code. Open the URL in any browser, enter the code, and sign in with your Microsoft account. Tokens are cached in the OS keyring — the MCP server picks them up automatically.

Other CLI commands:

```bash
uv run outlook-mcp status   # Check auth status
uv run outlook-mcp logout   # Clear credentials
uv run outlook-mcp serve    # Start MCP server (default, used by OpenClaw/Claude)
```

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json` (created with `0600` permissions).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `client_id` | `string` | `null` | Azure AD application (client) ID. Required for auth. |
| `tenant_id` | `string` | `"consumers"` | Azure AD tenant. Use `"consumers"` for personal Microsoft accounts. |
| `timezone` | `string` | `"UTC"` | IANA timezone (e.g. `"America/New_York"`). Used for relative date computations in calendar tools. |
| `read_only` | `bool` | `false` | When `true`, all write tools (send, reply, move, delete, create, update, RSVP) return an error. |
| `allow_categories` | `list[string]` | `[]` | Optional. Restrict write tools to specific categories (see below). Empty list = all writes allowed when `read_only: false`. |

### Granular Write Permissions (optional)

By default, `read_only: false` unlocks **all** write tools. For finer control, set `allow_categories` to restrict write access to specific categories. Read tools (list, search, get) are always allowed — `allow_categories` only narrows the write surface.

**Available categories:**

| Category | Tools | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `mail_drafts` | create/update/delete draft | Safe — drafts only, no send |
| `mail_triage` | move, delete (soft), flag, categorize, mark read, copy, batch | Moderate — reversible except hard delete |
| `mail_folders` | create/rename/delete folder | Moderate |
| `mail_send` | send, reply, forward, send_draft, send_with_attachments | **Dangerous** — sends email on your behalf |
| `calendar_write` | create/update/delete event, RSVP | Moderate — creates calendar entries |
| `contacts_write` | create/update/delete contact | Moderate |
| `todo_write` | create/update/complete/delete task | Safe — your own task list |

**Example policies:**

**Draft-only assistant** (agent can compose drafts, you review and send):

```json
{ "read_only": false, "allow_categories": ["mail_drafts", "mail_triage", "todo_write"] }
```

**Calendar-only** (agent can manage your schedule, nothing else):

```json
{ "read_only": false, "allow_categories": ["calendar_write"] }
```

**Full write access** (agent can do everything):

```json
{ "read_only": false }
```

**Read-only** (safest default, no writes):

```json
{ "read_only": true }
```

When `allow_categories` is set, any tool in a non-allowed category returns a permission-denied error (`PermissionDeniedError`) naming the blocked category. When `allow_categories` is empty (or unset) and `read_only` is false, all write tools are permitted. `read_only: true` always takes precedence — if set, all writes are blocked regardless of `allow_categories`. Unknown category names are rejected at config load time with a validation error; only the seven names above are accepted.

## Privacy and Security

- **Zero telemetry.** No analytics, no tracking, no usage data collected.
- **Zero local caching.** Every call goes directly to Microsoft Graph. No local email/calendar storage.
- **Zero third-party calls.** The server only talks to `graph.microsoft.com` and `login.microsoftonline.com`.
- **Token storage.** OAuth tokens are stored in your OS keyring via `azure-identity` (`TokenCachePersistenceOptions`). On macOS this is Keychain. No tokens are written to disk in plaintext.
- **No logging of sensitive data.** Message bodies, recipient addresses, and tokens are never logged.
- **Config permissions.** Config directory is `0700`, config file is `0600`. Symlinked configs are rejected.
- **Input validation.** All user inputs (email addresses, Graph IDs, OData filters, KQL queries, datetimes) are validated and sanitized before reaching the Graph API.
