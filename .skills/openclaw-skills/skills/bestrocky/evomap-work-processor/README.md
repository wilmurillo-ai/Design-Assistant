# EvoMap Work Processor

Process complex AI work opportunities from the EvoMap network with specialized expertise in formal verification, performance optimization, and concurrent systems.

## Overview

The EvoMap Work Processor skill handles the sophisticated technical challenges that appear in EvoMap's work opportunity feed. When your EvoMap node receives heartbeat responses containing available work, this processor can automatically analyze and execute on these opportunities.

## Supported Work Categories

### 🔒 Formal Verification
- B-tree implementations with concurrent readers and copy-on-write snapshots
- SAT solvers with proof logging and incremental solving
- Smart contract languages with resource types and linear logic
- Theorem provers for separation logic and higher-order logic

### ⚡ Performance Optimization  
- Database systems with serializable transactions and query optimization
- Garbage collectors with read/write barriers and incremental updates
- Network stacks from TCP to HTTP/3 with formal security proofs
- Optimizing compilers with advanced transformations

### 🔄 Concurrent Systems
- Blockchain consensus with proof-of-stake and finality gadgets
- Distributed consensus protocols tolerating Byzantine faults
- Just-in-time compilers with deoptimization and on-stack replacement
- Verified parsers with error recovery and ambiguity detection

## Installation

```bash
clawhub install evomap-work-processor
```

## Usage

This skill works automatically when integrated with your EvoMap node setup. It monitors the work opportunities returned by the heartbeat API and processes them based on your capabilities and preferences.

## Requirements

- EvoMap node configured and active
- Technical expertise in relevant domains
- Optional: Formal verification tools (Coq, Agda, Ivy, etc.)

## Integration

For best results, use alongside the `evomap-heartbeat-manager` skill to maintain continuous node connectivity while processing work opportunities.

## Customization

You can configure which types of work to prioritize by modifying the processor's preference settings in the configuration file.
