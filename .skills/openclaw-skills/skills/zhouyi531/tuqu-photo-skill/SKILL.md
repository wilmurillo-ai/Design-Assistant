# Tuqu Photo API

## Overview

Use this skill to call the Dream Weaver APIs safely and consistently across both hosts: `https://photo.tuqu.ai` for image and catalog flows, and `https://billing.tuqu.ai/dream-weaver` for recharge flows. The main failure mode is choosing the wrong host or authentication mode: body `userKey` for `/api/billing/balance` and all v2 generation endpoints, header `x-api-key` for character management and history APIs, `Authorization: Bearer <serviceKey>` for recharge endpoints, and no auth for discovery and prompt enhancement. `serviceKey` and `userKey` refer to the same credential.

## Set Base URLs Only

Set these only when overriding the defaults:

- `TUQU_BASE_URL=https://photo.tuqu.ai`
- `TUQU_BILLING_BASE_URL=https://billing.tuqu.ai/dream-weaver`

Do not rely on a shared credential environment variable. The agent must provide the credential explicitly on
every authenticated request so multiple roles can use different service keys safely.

Prefer `scripts/tuqu_request.py` over ad-hoc `curl` so host selection, auth, and JSON handling stay consistent.

## Choose the Endpoint

Follow this decision flow:

1. Need available presets, template IDs, style IDs, or usage hints? Call `/api/catalog`.
2. Need direct text or reference-image generation without preset logic? Optionally call `/api/enhance-prompt`, then call `/api/v2/generate-image`.
3. Need template or style generation from a preset ID? Call `/api/catalog` first, prepare at least one source image, then call `/api/v2/apply-preset`.
4. Need persistent characters or multi-character scene generation? Use `/api/characters`, optionally call `/api/enhance-prompt`, then call `/api/v2/generate-for-character`.
5. Need prior outputs or audit trail data? Use `/api/history`.
6. Need pricing or remaining credits? Use `/api/model-costs` and `/api/billing/balance`.
7. Need to top up a project's balance? Call `/api/v1/recharge/plans`, then `/api/v1/recharge/wechat` or `/api/v1/recharge/stripe`.

Read [references/endpoints.md](references/endpoints.md) for exact request and response fields.
Read [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) for end-to-end task recipes.

## Follow Operating Rules

- Verify the auth mode before every request. Even when the same credential backs multiple endpoints, `/api/v2/generate-for-character` still requires body `userKey`, `/api/characters` and `/api/history` still require `x-api-key`, and recharge endpoints still require bearer auth.
- Verify the host before every request. Recharge endpoints live on `TUQU_BILLING_BASE_URL`, not `TUQU_BASE_URL`.
- Provide the credential explicitly on every authenticated helper call with `--service-key <role-service-key>`, unless the workflow explicitly requires you to place it in the JSON body or query string.
- Send JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Send base64 images as full data URLs such as `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`, not raw base64 fragments.
- Treat `/api/catalog` as the source of truth for `presetId`, preset type, and variable names. Do not guess placeholders.
- For `/api/v2/apply-preset`, send at least one `sourceImages` or `sourceImageUrls` entry. Template presets treat them as face-reference images; style presets treat the first one as the image to transform.
- Use `/api/model-costs` before overriding `modelId` on cost-sensitive jobs.
- Use `ratio: "Original"` only when at least one reference image is present, because the server measures the first reference image.
- Prefer `Authorization: Bearer <serviceKey>` for recharge endpoints. Use query or body fallback only when the caller cannot set headers.
- Preserve `imageUrl`, `promptUsed`, `model`, `remainingBalance`, `transactionId`, and `historyItem` when the API returns them.
- Preserve recharge checkout fields such as `orderId`, `unifpayOrderId`, `checkoutUrl`, `sessionId`, `qrcodeImg`, `codeUrl`, and `payUrl`.
- Surface API error codes directly, especially `INVALID_REQUEST`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, `GENERATION_FAILED`, `PAYMENT_NOT_CONFIGURED`, and `CURRENCY_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

## Use the Request Helper

Use the helper for repeatable API calls:

```bash
python3 scripts/tuqu_request.py GET /api/catalog --query type=all
python3 scripts/tuqu_request.py GET /api/model-costs
python3 scripts/tuqu_request.py POST /api/enhance-prompt \
  --json '{"category":"portrait","prompt":"soft editorial portrait with window light"}'
python3 scripts/tuqu_request.py POST /api/v2/generate-image \
  --service-key <role-service-key> \
  --body-file payloads/generate-image.json
python3 scripts/tuqu_request.py GET /api/v1/recharge/plans \
  --service-key <role-service-key>
python3 scripts/tuqu_request.py POST /api/v1/recharge/stripe \
  --service-key <role-service-key> \
  --json '{"planId":"698b7fead4c733c85f2a9c74","successUrl":"https://your-app.com/payment/success","cancelUrl":"https://your-app.com/payment/cancel"}'
```

The helper auto-detects both host and auth for the supported endpoints in this skill. Pass `--service-key` on every authenticated call. Override with `--base-url` or `--auth-mode` only when you have a documented reason.

## Handle Common Tasks

### Generate from prompt or references

1. Optionally call `/api/enhance-prompt` when the user prompt is vague.
2. Call `/api/v2/generate-image` with `prompt`, `referenceImages`, `referenceImageUrls`, or a combination.
3. Return the `imageUrl` and any balance or transaction metadata.

### Generate from a preset

1. Call `/api/catalog` and pick a valid preset.
2. Inspect whether the preset is a `template` or a `style`.
3. Provide at least one `sourceImages` or `sourceImageUrls` entry.
4. Fill `variableValues` only with the preset's defined placeholders.
5. Call `/api/v2/apply-preset`.

### Generate with saved characters

1. Create or look up characters through `/api/characters`.
2. Optionally enhance the scene prompt with `/api/enhance-prompt`.
3. Call `/api/v2/generate-for-character`.
4. Save or expose the returned `historyItem` when present.

### Inspect balance and history

1. Call `/api/billing/balance` before expensive jobs when the user asks about credits.
2. Call `/api/history` when the user asks for recent generations or to reconcile results.

### Recharge with WeChat or Stripe

1. Call `/api/v1/recharge/plans` to list valid `planId` values for the project bound to the service key.
2. If the user wants a WeChat QR payment, call `/api/v1/recharge/wechat` and return `qrcodeImg`, `codeUrl`, and `payUrl`.
3. If the user wants a card or Stripe-hosted checkout, call `/api/v1/recharge/stripe` and return `checkoutUrl`, `sessionId`, and `qrcodeImg`.
4. Keep `orderId` or `sessionId` in the response you surface; they are the primary support and reconciliation handles.

## Recover from Failures

- On `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, stop and report the remaining balance if available.
- On `INVALID_REQUEST`, compare the payload against [references/endpoints.md](references/endpoints.md) and call out the missing field explicitly.
- On `NOT_FOUND` from `/api/v2/apply-preset`, re-run `/api/catalog`; the `presetId` is wrong or no longer active.
- On `UNAUTHORIZED`, verify whether the endpoint expects body `userKey`, header `x-api-key`, or bearer `serviceKey`, and verify that the caller supplied the intended role-specific credential.
- On recharge `UNAUTHORIZED`, verify the service key has not been revoked or frozen and that you are sending it to the billing host.
- On `PAYMENT_NOT_CONFIGURED`, report which channel is missing at the project or global config layer.
- On `CURRENCY_NOT_SUPPORTED`, stop and explain that WeChat only supports direct `CNY` or `JPY`, plus `USD` via project FX conversion.
- On `GENERATION_FAILED`, report whether the response says the request was refunded.
