# Security Guidelines for OpenClaw Twitter

## Overview

This document outlines critical security considerations when using OpenClaw Twitter skill for Twitter/X automation.

## Risk Classification

### ✅ Low Risk: Read Operations (Recommended)

**What they are:**
- User information retrieval
- Tweet search
- Trend monitoring
- Follower/following lists
- User search

**Security profile:**
- No Twitter account credentials required
- Only AIsa API key needed
- No sensitive data transmission
- Safe for production use
- Recommended for 95% of use cases

**Example use cases:**
- Social media monitoring
- Competitive intelligence
- Market research
- Trend analysis
- Influencer tracking

### ⚠️ High Risk: Write Operations (Use with Extreme Caution)

**What they are:**
- Account login
- Posting tweets
- Liking tweets
- Retweeting
- Profile updates

**Security profile:**
- Requires transmitting email + password + proxy to third-party API
- Full account access granted to `api.aisa.one`
- Potential for account suspension
- Potential for credential theft if API is compromised
- Violates Twitter's terms of service regarding credential sharing

**Use only if:**
- You have a legitimate automation need
- You're using a dedicated test/automation account
- You understand and accept all risks
- You've reviewed AIsa's security practices

## Critical Security Warnings

### 🚨 Never Use Write Operations With:

❌ **Your primary Twitter account**
- Risk: Complete account compromise
- Impact: Loss of personal account, followers, history

❌ **Verified accounts**
- Risk: Loss of verification status
- Impact: Brand damage, loss of credibility

❌ **High-value accounts**
- Risk: Financial or reputational damage
- Impact: Business disruption

❌ **Accounts with sensitive followers/DMs**
- Risk: Privacy breach
- Impact: Exposure of private communications

❌ **Accounts you cannot afford to lose**
- Risk: Permanent suspension
- Impact: Unrecoverable loss

### ✅ Only Use Write Operations With:

✅ **Dedicated automation accounts**
- Created specifically for testing/automation
- No personal value attached
- Separate from your identity

✅ **Unique passwords**
- Never reuse passwords from other accounts
- Use strong, randomly generated passwords

✅ **Test data only**
- No real followers or connections
- No sensitive information

## Threat Model

### Threat 1: Credential Interception

**Risk:** Your Twitter credentials are transmitted to `api.aisa.one`

**Attack scenarios:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack during transmission
- API provider data breach
- Insider threat at API provider
- API account compromise

**Mitigation:**
- Use dedicated accounts with no value
- Use unique passwords
- Never store credentials in code
- Monitor account activity
- Enable 2FA on your real account

### Threat 2: Account Suspension

**Risk:** Twitter detects automation and suspends account

**Attack scenarios:**
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual activity patterns
- Multiple accounts from same IP
- Violation of Twitter ToS

**Mitigation:**
- Use residential proxies
- Respect rate limits
- Gradual ramp-up of activity
- Human-like behavior patterns
- Accept that suspension is possible

### Threat 3: API Key Exposure

**Risk:** Your AIsa API key is exposed or stolen

**Attack scenarios:**
- Code repository leaks
- Log file exposure
- Environment variable leaks
- Shared system access

**Mitigation:**
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor usage in AIsa dashboard
- Restrict key permissions if possible

### Threat 4: Proxy Security

**Risk:** Proxy credentials or traffic are compromised

**Attack scenarios:**
- Proxy provider logs traffic
- Proxy provider shares data
- Proxy infrastructure compromise

**Mitigation:**
- Use reputable proxy providers
- Understand proxy provider's data retention
- Use HTTPS proxies
- Rotate proxy credentials

## Best Practices

### 1. Account Isolation

```
✅ DO:
- Create separate accounts for automation
- Use different emails for each automation account
- Keep personal and automation accounts completely separate

❌ DON'T:
- Use your personal account for any automation
- Connect automation accounts to your identity
- Follow your personal account from automation accounts
```

### 2. Credential Management

```
✅ DO:
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Generate unique passwords for each account
- Use a password manager
- Enable 2FA on your personal accounts

❌ DON'T:
- Hardcode credentials in scripts
- Reuse passwords across accounts
- Store credentials in plain text files
- Share credentials across systems
```

### 3. API Key Security

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Use environment variables
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python twitter_client.py user-info --username example

# ❌ BAD: Hardcoded in script
api_key = "sk-abc123..."  # Never do this!

# ✅ GOOD: Add to .gitignore
echo "AISA_API_KEY" >> .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# ✅ GOOD: Rotate regularly
# Replace old key with new key every 30-90 days
```

### 4. Monitoring

```
✅ DO:
- Check AIsa dashboard daily for unusual usage
- Monitor automation account activity
- Set up alerts for unexpected charges
- Review account login history

❌ DON'T:
- Ignore usage spikes
- Disable notifications
- Share API keys without monitoring
```

### 5. Rate Limiting

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Respect rate limits
import time

for user in users:
    client.user_info(user)
    time.sleep(1)  # Rate limiting

# ❌ BAD: Aggressive polling
while True:
    client.search("keyword")  # Will get rate limited
```

### 6. Proxy Usage

```
✅ DO:
- Use residential proxies for write operations
- Rotate proxies for different accounts
- Use HTTPS proxies
- Verify proxy provider reputation

❌ DON'T:
- Use free public proxies
- Share proxies across many accounts
- Use proxies from untrusted providers
```

### 7. Error Handling

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Handle errors gracefully
try:
    result = client.send_tweet(username, text)
    if not result.get('success'):
        logger.error(f"Tweet failed: {result.get('error')}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"API error: {e}")

# ❌ BAD: Ignore errors
result = client.send_tweet(username, text)
# No error checking
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Twitter Terms of Service

**Important:** Review Twitter's current ToS regarding:
- Automated account creation
- Bulk operations
- Credential sharing
- API usage limitations

**Note:** Using third-party services to access Twitter may violate ToS even if technically possible.

### Data Protection

If your use case involves personal data:
- Review GDPR/CCPA requirements
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Obtain necessary consents
- Document data processing

### Industry Regulations

For regulated industries:
- Verify compliance with sector-specific rules
- Document security measures
- Implement audit trails
- Consider legal review

---

## Incident Response

### If Your Automation Account Is Suspended

1. **Don't panic** - This is a known risk
2. **Document what happened** - Useful for future reference
3. **Don't attempt to circumvent** - Can lead to IP bans
4. **Accept the loss** - That's why we use dedicated accounts
5. **Review what went wrong** - Improve for next time

### If Your API Key Is Compromised

1. **Immediately revoke the key** in AIsa dashboard
2. **Generate a new key**
3. **Review recent usage** for unauthorized activity
4. **Update all systems** with new key
5. **Investigate how leak occurred**
6. **Implement controls** to prevent recurrence

### If Your Credentials Are Leaked

1. **Change password immediately**
2. **Review account activity** for unauthorized access
3. **Check connected apps** and revoke suspicious ones
4. **Enable 2FA** if not already enabled
5. **Monitor for abuse**
