- No authentication required
- No credentials transmitted
- Use these by default

### ⚠️ HIGH RISK: Write Operations (Use with Caution)
- login, post, like, retweet
- Requires transmitting credentials to third-party API
- Only use with dedicated test accounts
- Assume account may be suspended

## 🎓 User Journey

### For Monitoring/Research Users (95% of use cases)
```
Read README → See "Read operations are safe" 
  → Use search/trends/user-info 
  → No warnings, works great ✅
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these after deployment:
1. Reduced security incidents
2. More informed user questions
3. Higher ratio of read vs write operations
4. Positive feedback on transparency
5. Fewer compromised primary accounts

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Do I need to remove write operations?**
A: No. They have legitimate uses. Goal is informed consent.

**Q: Will this scare users away?**
A: Some will avoid risky operations - that's the goal! Safe users proceed safely.

**Q: What if users ignore warnings?**
A: We've provided proper disclosure. They accept the risk.

**Q: Should I add technical controls?**
A: Consider: rate limiting, security quiz, monitoring, optional 2FA.
