## ⚡ Pro Tips for Investor-Ready Plans

- **Investors read the exec summary first** — if it doesn't hook them in 60 seconds, the rest doesn't matter
- **Never make up market size numbers** — this skill scrapes real data. Investors verify everything.
- **LTV/CAC ratio above 3x is the minimum** — below that and no serious investor will bite
- **Show the path to break-even clearly** — "Month 18" beats "we'll be profitable eventually"
- **Use the pitch video in your cold email outreach** — video intros get 3x more replies than text
