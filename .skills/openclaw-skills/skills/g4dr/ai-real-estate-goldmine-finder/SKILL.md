## 💥 Why This Skill Is a Goldmine on ClawHub

Real estate is the **#1 wealth-building vehicle on earth**. Every property investor, buy-to-let landlord, house flipper, Airbnb host, and real estate agent is constantly hunting for the next deal.

The problem: the best deals disappear in hours. Finding them requires scanning hundreds of listings, running comps, calculating yields, and researching neighbourhoods — all manually.

This skill automates the entire deal-finding pipeline. For any market. In minutes.

**Target audience:** Property investors, buy-to-let landlords, house flippers, Airbnb hosts, real estate agents, developers, wealth managers. Every person trying to build wealth through property.

**What gets automated:**
- 🔍 Scrape **every listing** in a target area — price, days on market, price reductions
- 📉 Detect **undervalued properties** — priced below comparable sales
- 🚨 Find **distressed sellers** — long days on market, multiple price drops, estate sales
- 💰 Calculate **rental yield & ROI** — buy-to-let and Airbnb projections
- 📈 Score **neighbourhood trajectory** — up-and-coming areas before prices spike
- ✍️ Generate **deal analysis report** per property with go/no-go recommendation
- 🎬 Produce **investment brief video** via [InVideo AI](https://invideo.sjv.io/TBB) for partners or lenders

## ⚙️ Full Workflow

```
INPUT: Target city/postcode + investment strategy + budget
        ↓
STEP 1 — Full Market Scrape
  └─ All active listings in target area + price band
  └─ Extract: price, size, bedrooms, days on market, price history
  └─ Pull recent sold prices for comparable properties
        ↓
STEP 2 — Undervaluation Detection
  └─ Compare asking price vs avg price per sqft in same postcode
  └─ Flag properties priced 10%+ below comparable sales
  └─ Detect recent price reductions (2+ drops = motivated seller)
        ↓
STEP 3 — Distressed Seller Signals
  └─ Days on market: 60+ days = seller pressure
  └─ Multiple price reductions in short period
  └─ Keywords in listing: "chain-free", "must sell", "estate sale", "probate"
  └─ Empty property signals (utilities disconnected, no furniture photos)
        ↓
STEP 4 — Rental Yield & ROI Calculation
  └─ Scrape Airbnb: what similar properties earn short-let in this area
  └─ Estimate long-let rental from market comparables
  └─ Calculate gross yield, net yield (after costs), cash-on-cash return
  └─ Break-even timeline
        ↓
STEP 5 — Neighbourhood Trajectory Scoring
  └─ Google News: regeneration plans, new transport links, investment news
  └─ Google Maps: new cafés, gyms, co-working spaces opening = gentrification signal
  └─ Reddit: "moving to X" threads + local sentiment
  └─ Planning applications: new developments = rising demand signal
        ↓
STEP 6 — Deal Score Calculation (0–100)
  └─ Undervaluation margin (30%)
  └─ Rental yield strength (25%)
  └─ Distressed seller urgency (25%)
  └─ Neighbourhood growth trajectory (20%)
        ↓
STEP 7 — Claude AI Writes Full Deal Analysis
  └─ Go/No-Go recommendation with rationale
  └─ Suggested offer price (below asking)
  └─ Key risks + mitigation
  └─ Exit strategy options (flip / hold / short-let)
        ↓
STEP 8 — InVideo AI Produces Investment Brief Video
  └─ 60-second deal overview for lenders, JV partners or your own records
  └─ Key numbers: price, yield, ROI, comparable sales
  └─ Professional format — perfect for raising private finance
        ↓
OUTPUT: Ranked deal list + full analysis per property + investment brief video

- **Two price reductions = near-desperation** — they've already accepted less is coming
- **Run the Airbnb calculator on every deal** — short-let yields are often double long-let
- **Rising neighbourhood > already risen** — buy the area before the coffee shops, not after
- **The investment brief video closes JV partners** — lenders respond to visuals + numbers together
