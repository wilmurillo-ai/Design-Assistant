## ⚡ Pro Tips for Successful Market Entry

- **Always localize pricing to local PPP** — charging US prices in emerging markets kills conversion
- **Regulatory research first** — one compliance issue can shut you down before you start
- **Find a local champion** — one well-connected local partner beats 10 cold remote sales reps
- **G2 & Capterra DACH/local listings are underrated** — most companies ignore them in new markets
- **Run the report for 3 countries simultaneously** — pick the best opportunity, not the first idea
