## 💥 Why "Steal Customers From Competitors" Will Go Viral on ClawHub

This is the most psychologically compelling angle in B2B sales. Not "find new leads" — **"take your competitor's customers who are already unhappy."** These people have proven budget, proven need, and proven frustration. They're the warmest leads on earth.

Top companies like HubSpot, Notion, and Slack built entire growth strategies around competitor displacement. This skill automates it entirely.

**Target audience:** Every B2B company with competitors — which is every B2B company on earth.

**What gets automated:**
- 😡 Find **unhappy competitor customers** — actively complaining right now
- 💸 Detect **pricing gaps** — where competitors are overcharging or under-delivering
- 🕳️ Map **underserved niches** — segments competitors ignore completely
- 📉 Identify **churn signals** — contract renewals, complaints, migration questions
- 🎯 Generate **displacement strategy** per competitor weakness
- ✍️ Write **hyper-personalized steal outreach** referencing their exact complaint
- 🎬 Produce **competitor comparison video** via [InVideo AI](https://invideo.sjv.io/TBB)
