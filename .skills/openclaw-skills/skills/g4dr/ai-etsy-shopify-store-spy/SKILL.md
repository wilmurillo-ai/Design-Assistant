  └─ Extract: title, price, review count, sales estimate, tags
  └─ Estimate monthly revenue per product + total store revenue
        ↓
STEP 2 — Best-Seller Pattern Recognition
  └─ What do the top 10 products have in common?
  └─ Price point sweet spot for this niche

        ↓
STEP 3 — SEO Keyword Extraction

  └─ Google keywords driving organic traffic to Shopify stores

  └─ Pinterest keyword clusters for visual discovery
        ↓
STEP 4 — Review Mining (1 & 2 Star)
  └─ What do customers hate about top competitor products?
  └─ Recurring complaints = your product differentiation list

  └─ Bundle opportunities: what products are bought together?
        ↓
STEP 6 — Launch Strategy Generation
  └─ Top 5 products to launch first (highest demand, lowest competition)
  └─ Pricing strategy: entry price → raise after 10 reviews
  └─ SEO listing formula: title + 13 tags + description structure
  └─ Pinterest + TikTok organic traffic plan
        ↓
STEP 7 — Claude AI Writes Optimized Listings
  └─ Etsy: title + 13 tags + description (SEO + conversion optimized)
  └─ Shopify: product title + description + meta tags
  └─ Each listing built from real keyword + review data
        ↓
STEP 8 — InVideo AI Produces Store Launch Video
