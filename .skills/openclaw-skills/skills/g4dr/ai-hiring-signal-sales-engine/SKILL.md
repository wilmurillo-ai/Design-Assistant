> Every job posting is a buying signal in disguise. A company hiring a "Head of Sales Operations" needs a CRM. Hiring "5 SDRs" needs outbound software. Hiring a "Data Analyst" needs a BI tool. This skill scrapes every relevant job posting in real-time, decodes the hidden buying signal inside each one, and delivers personalized outreach to the decision maker — before your competitors even notice the posting.

---

## 💥 Why This Skill Will Explode on ClawHub

The **Job Market Intelligence** skill already has **325 views** — one of the top on the platform. This skill takes that data and turns it into direct revenue.

Job postings are the most underused source of B2B intent data in existence. Every single day, thousands of companies publicly announce exactly what they're struggling with, what they're investing in, and what they need — through their job descriptions.

This skill is the only one on ClawHub that **decodes job postings as sales intelligence** and turns them into a full outreach campaign automatically.

**Target audience:** Every B2B SaaS company, agency, consultant, and service business. If a company hiring a specific role means they need your product — this skill is your unfair advantage.

**What gets automated:**
- 🔍 Scrape **LinkedIn, Indeed & job boards** for role-specific hiring signals daily
- 🧠 Decode **hidden buying signal** in every job posting — what tool/service does this role require?
- 💰 Score each company by **budget signals** — headcount growth + funding = real spend
- 👤 Find **decision maker** — not the person being hired, the person doing the hiring
- ✍️ Write **job-specific outreach** that references the exact role they're hiring for
- 🎬 Produce **prospecting video** via [InVideo AI](https://invideo.sjv.io/TBB) for high-value targets
- 📅 Build **daily pipeline** — fresh hiring signals every morning

## ⚙️ The Hiring Signal Decoder Library

The skill uses a **pre-built signal decoder** that maps job titles to buying intent:

```
HIRING SIGNAL → YOUR PRODUCT OPPORTUNITY

"Head of Sales Operations" or "RevOps Manager"
→ They're scaling sales process = need CRM, sales intelligence, forecasting tools

"5x SDR / BDR roles posted at once"
→ Building outbound from scratch = need sequencing, dialer, lead gen tools

"Data Engineer" or "Analytics Engineer"
→ Building data infrastructure = need BI tools, data warehouse, ETL platforms

"Head of Customer Success" (first CS hire)
→ Scaling post-product-market-fit = need CS software, NPS tools, onboarding platforms

"Performance Marketing Manager"
→ Scaling paid acquisition = need attribution, ad management, landing page tools

"Cybersecurity Engineer" or "CISO"
→ Security investment = need compliance, endpoint, identity tools

"Head of Finance" or "VP of Finance" (first hire)
→ Financial operations scaling = need ERP, billing, expense management

"Recruiter" or "Head of Talent" (multiple roles)
→ Hiring surge = need ATS, HRIS, employer branding tools

"IT Manager" or "Head of IT"
→ Tech stack formalizing = need MDM, SSO, IT management tools

"Content Manager" + "SEO Specialist"
→ Building content engine = need SEO tools, CMS, content platforms
```

## ⚙️ Full Workflow

```
INPUT: Your product/service + the hiring signals that indicate need
        ↓
STEP 1 — Daily Hiring Signal Scrape
  └─ LinkedIn Jobs: posted in last 24-48 hours matching signal roles
  └─ Indeed: same signals on broader job board
  └─ Filter: company size, industry, location, posting date
        ↓
STEP 2 — Signal Decoding
  └─ Match job title + requirements to YOUR buying signal library
  └─ Read full job description for additional context signals
  └─ Detect urgency: "ASAP", "immediate start", multiple roles = high urgency
        ↓
STEP 3 — Company Intelligence
  └─ Headcount growth: hiring 10% of team = scaling fast
  └─ Funding: recent raise = budget unlocked
  └─ News: new contract, expansion, product launch = growth phase
  └─ Tech stack: what tools are they already using?
        ↓
STEP 4 — Decision Maker Identification
  └─ NOT the role being hired — the person hiring them
  └─ e.g. Hiring Sales Ops → find VP of Sales or CRO
  └─ e.g. Hiring Data Engineer → find VP of Engineering or CTO
  └─ Extract: name, title, LinkedIn, email
        ↓
STEP 5 — Lead Scoring (0–100)
  └─ Signal strength (35%): how directly does this role indicate need?
  └─ Budget signal (30%): funding + headcount growth + company size
  └─ Urgency (20%): posting recency + volume of similar roles
  └─ Decision maker accessibility (15%): contactable + active?
        ↓
STEP 6 — Claude AI Writes Job-Specific Outreach
  └─ Email references THE specific job posting by title
  └─ Connects the hiring need to your product's value
  └─ Makes them feel understood — you see what they're building
  └─ LinkedIn DM: shorter, references same signal
        ↓
STEP 7 — InVideo AI Produces Prospecting Video
  └─ For top 5 highest-score leads
  └─ 60-second "we see what you're building" video
  └─ References their growth phase + your solution
  └─ Converts 4x better than text for enterprise targets
        ↓
OUTPUT: Daily lead list ranked by score + outreach per lead + video for top targets

YOUR PRODUCT:
- Name: {{product_name}}

HIRING SIGNALS TO DECODE: {{signal_library}}

FOR EACH JOB POSTING:
1. Decode the buying signal:
   - What does hiring this role tell you about their current pain?
   - What tool/service gap does this role reveal?
   - What is the EXACT moment in their growth this represents?

2. Lead score (0–100):
   - Signal strength (35%): direct vs indirect buying signal
   - Budget signal (30%): funding recency + headcount growth + company size
   - Urgency (20%): posting age + volume of similar roles + urgency language in JD
   - Decision maker accessibility (15%): contactable + recently active?

3. Company intelligence summary:
   - Recent news relevant to your product
   - Tech stack detected + your integration advantage
   - Growth phase interpretation

4. Decision maker (the HIRING manager, not the role being hired):
   - Name, title, LinkedIn, email
   - Recent activity for personalization
   - Best contact channel + timing

5. Outreach (references the SPECIFIC job posting):
   - Email: job title in subject, decode their growth stage, your integration advantage, outcome
   - LinkedIn DM: 80 words max
   - Best channel based on recent activity

6. 60-second video script for top 5 leads:
   - Opens with their company name + the specific hiring signal
   - Connects their growth moment to your solution
   - Ends with timing-based urgency (before the new hire starts)

GOLDEN RULE: "I saw you're hiring a [role]" is the most powerful cold email opener in B2B.
It proves you're paying attention. Use it every single time.

OUTPUT: Valid JSON only. No markdown. No preamble.
