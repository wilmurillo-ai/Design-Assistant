## 💥 Why This Skill Will Dominate ClawHub

Amazon FBA is a **$600 billion marketplace**. Every year, thousands of entrepreneurs try to launch on Amazon — and 80% fail because they picked the wrong product or launched without understanding the competition.

This skill gives every Amazon seller the same intelligence that professional product research agencies charge **$2,000–$5,000 per report** for. In 10 minutes. For under $3.

**Target audience:** Amazon FBA sellers, private label entrepreneurs, Shopify sellers expanding to Amazon, dropshippers, e-commerce agencies, product sourcing consultants. That's millions of active sellers worldwide.

**What gets automated:**
- 🔍 Scrape **Amazon search results** for any niche — sales estimates, BSR, reviews
- 📊 Score **product opportunities** — high demand, low competition, good margins
- 💬 Mine **1-star reviews** of top competitors — build a better product before you launch
- 💰 Calculate **real profit margins** — product cost + FBA fees + ads = true net profit
- ✍️ Write **fully optimized Amazon listing** — title, bullets, description, backend keywords
- 📈 Build **launch strategy** — keyword ranking, PPC structure, review velocity plan
- 🎬 Produce **product launch video** via [InVideo AI](https://invideo.sjv.io/TBB) for listing & ads

## ⚙️ Full Workflow

```
INPUT: Niche or product category + target marketplace + budget
        ↓
STEP 1 — Product Opportunity Scan
  └─ Scrape top 100 products in niche by BSR
  └─ Extract: monthly sales estimate, review count, avg rating, price
  └─ Flag: high revenue + low review count = entry opportunity
        ↓
STEP 2 — Competition Depth Analysis
  └─ Top 10 competitors: review quality, listing quality, brand strength
  └─ Identify weak listings: poor photos, thin bullets, low keyword use
  └─ Detect private label vs brand — easier to compete vs brand
        ↓
STEP 3 — 1-Star Review Mining (The Secret Weapon)
  └─ All 1-star & 2-star reviews of top 5 competitors
  └─ Categorize complaints: quality, packaging, missing feature, sizing
  └─ These complaints = your product differentiation checklist
        ↓
STEP 4 — Profit Margin Calculation
  └─ Estimated product cost (from Alibaba/sourcing benchmarks)
  └─ Amazon FBA fees (weight + category based)
  └─ Referral fee (% of sale price)
  └─ Estimated PPC cost per unit
  └─ Net margin at current market price
        ↓
STEP 5 — Keyword Research
  └─ Primary keywords: highest volume, direct match
  └─ Long-tail keywords: lower competition, high intent
  └─ Backend keywords: hidden search terms competitors miss
  └─ PPC keyword clusters: exact / phrase / broad
        ↓
STEP 6 — Claude AI Writes Optimized Amazon Listing
  └─ Title: keyword-rich, within character limit, benefit-led
  └─ 5 bullet points: feature + benefit + differentiator structure
  └─ Description: story-driven, keyword-natural, conversion-focused
  └─ Backend search terms: 250 bytes of hidden keywords
        ↓
STEP 7 — Launch Strategy
  └─ Day 1–7: keyword ranking plan (honeymoon period tactics)
  └─ Review velocity: how many reviews needed to compete
  └─ PPC structure: launch campaign + defensive campaign
  └─ Break-even timeline at different sales velocity scenarios
        ↓
STEP 8 — InVideo AI Produces Product Video
  └─ 30-second product showcase video for listing main image
  └─ 60-second ad video for Sponsored Brand campaigns
  └─ Increases conversion rate 15–25% vs image-only listings
        ↓
OUTPUT: Opportunity report + competitor analysis + listing copy + launch plan + product video
