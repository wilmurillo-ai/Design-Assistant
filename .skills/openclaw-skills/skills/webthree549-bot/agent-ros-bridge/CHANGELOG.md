## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-15

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

#### Removed: Mock Mode
- **Mock mode has been completely removed**
- Authentication is now **always required** with no bypass option
- Bridge will fail to start without JWT_SECRET

#### Changed: Example Deployment
- All examples now run in **Docker containers only**
- No more native mock mode execution
- Examples provide isolated, secure testing environments

#### Changed: Default Bind Address
- Default changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- Reduces accidental network exposure

### Security Improvements
- **Mandatory authentication**: No way to disable auth
- **Docker isolation**: All examples run in containers
- **Simplified security model**: JWT_SECRET always required
- **No ambiguous states**: Clear security posture

### Documentation
- Updated README for Docker-only examples
- Updated SECURITY.md with new security model
- Created docker-compose.yml files for all examples

## [0.2.4] - 2025-02-15

### Documentation Fixes
- Fixed README to reference correct entry points (agent-ros-bridge CLI)
- Clarified JWT_SECRET required for production, optional for mock mode
- Added MOCK_MODE and BRIDGE_HOST env variables to SKILL.md
- Fixed requires/env metadata to show JWT_SECRET as optional
- Improved security documentation clarity

## [0.2.3] - 2025-02-15

### ClawHub Submission
- Reformatted SKILL.md metadata for registry compatibility
- Fresh release to trigger new security scan
- Optimized submission package structure

## [0.2.2] - 2025-02-15

### Security & Documentation
- Removed curl|bash install pattern from README (security best practice)
- Added mock mode security warnings (localhost-only recommendation)
- Added BRIDGE_HOST=127.0.0.1 guidance for testing
- Synced _version.py auto-generated file
- Cleaned submission package for ClawHub

## [0.2.1] - 2025-02-14

### Security (Critical)

- **BREAKING**: JWT_SECRET now required when auth enabled (no auto-generation)
- Added JWT_SECRET to SKILL.md required environment variables
- Added security warnings to README and run.sh scripts
