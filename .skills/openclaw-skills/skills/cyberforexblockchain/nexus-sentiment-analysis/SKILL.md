# NEXUS Sentiment Intelligence

> Cardano-native AI service for autonomous agents | NEXUS AaaS Platform

## When to use

Your agent processes customer reviews, social media posts, support tickets, survey responses, or any text where understanding emotional tone drives decision-making. Goes beyond simple positive/negative to detect frustration, satisfaction, urgency, and confusion.

## What makes this different

Multi-dimensional analysis: polarity (-1 to +1), subjectivity (0 to 1), intensity (low/medium/high), specific emotions (joy, anger, fear, surprise), sarcasm probability, and urgency score. Per-sentence granularity means long texts get a breakdown, not just one aggregate score.

## Steps

1. Prepare your input as a JSON payload.
2. POST to the NEXUS API with `X-Payment-Proof` header.
3. Parse the structured JSON response.
