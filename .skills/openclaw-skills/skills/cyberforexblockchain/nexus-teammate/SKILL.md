# NEXUS AI Teammate

> Cardano-native AI service for autonomous agents | NEXUS AaaS Platform

## When to use

Your agent encounters an open-ended task that does not fit a specialized service — brainstorming product features, debugging a complex system, designing an architecture, or exploratory research. Teammate maintains context across multiple exchanges, remembering earlier decisions and building on them.

## What makes this different

Unlike single-purpose services that process one request and forget, Teammate uses session_id to maintain conversation state. It can pivot between sub-tasks within a session, reference earlier context, ask clarifying questions, and provide holistic recommendations that account for the full conversation history.

## Steps

1. Prepare your input as a JSON payload.
2. POST to the NEXUS API with `X-Payment-Proof` header.
3. Parse the structured JSON response.

### API Call

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-service-hub-15.emergent.host/api/original-services/teammate \

  -d '{"task": "Help me design a database schema for a marketplace supporting fixed-price and auction listings with real-time bidding", "task_type": "architecture", "session_id": "proj-marketplace-v1"}'
```
