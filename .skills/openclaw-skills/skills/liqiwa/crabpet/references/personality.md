# CrabPet Personality System

## How Personality is Determined

The pet engine scans all `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` daily log files and counts keyword occurrences 
across five personality dimensions. Each dimension produces a 0.0–1.0 score, normalized against 
the highest-scoring dimension. The dominant dimension becomes the pet's "primary personality."

Since scores are mixed, most pets will have a blend — e.g., 70% coder + 20% writer + 10% analyst.
This makes every pet unique.
