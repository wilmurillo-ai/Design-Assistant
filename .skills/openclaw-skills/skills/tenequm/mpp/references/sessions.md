# Sessions

## Why Sessions

Usage-based billing needs payment verification that keeps pace with the service. LLM inference generates hundreds of tokens - paying per-token on-chain would add seconds of latency per charge. Sessions fix this: one deposit into an on-chain escrow, then off-chain vouchers verified with CPU-only signature checks (~microseconds). The bottleneck becomes CPU, not blockchain TPS.

Key insight: a session amortizes on-chain cost across many interactions. Instead of 0.001 USD per on-chain tx per request, you pay one open tx + one close tx regardless of how many requests happen in between.

## Session Lifecycle

Four phases define a session's life:

### 1. Open

Client deposits tokens into an on-chain escrow contract, creating a payment channel. A unique `channelId` identifies the channel and holds deposited TIP-20 tokens.

### 2. Session (Vouchers)

Client signs EIP-712 typed vouchers with increasing cumulative amounts. Each voucher states "I have consumed up to X total." The server verifies each voucher with `ecrecover` - no RPC calls needed. The delta (current voucher minus previous voucher) represents the cost of the current request.

### 3. Top Up

If the channel balance runs low, the client deposits more tokens without closing. The session continues uninterrupted. When streaming, the server emits a `payment-need-voucher` SSE event to signal the client needs to top up.

### 4. Close

Either party can close the channel. The server calls `close()` on the escrow contract with the highest voucher, settling the final balance on-chain. Any unspent deposit is refunded to the client.

## Server Integration

```typescript
import { Mppx, Store, tempo } from 'mppx/server'
const mppx = Mppx.create({
  methods: [tempo({
    recipient: '0x...',
    store: Store.memory(), // or Store.cloudflare(), Store.upstash()
  })],
})

export async function handler(request: Request) {
  const result = await mppx.session({
    amount: '0.001',
    unitType: 'token',
  })(request)
  if (result.status === 402) return result.challenge
  return result.withReceipt(Response.json({ data: '...' }))
}
```

- `mppx.session()` returns a handler that manages the full lifecycle automatically.
- `result.status === 402` means the client has not yet opened a channel or the voucher is missing/invalid.
- `result.challenge` sends the 402 response with payment requirements.
- `result.withReceipt` attaches the payment receipt header to the response.

## Client Integration

```typescript
import { Mppx, tempo } from 'mppx/client'
Mppx.create({
  methods: [tempo({ account, maxDeposit: '1' })], // Lock up to 1 pathUSD
})
// 1st request: opens channel on-chain, sends initial voucher
// 2nd+ requests: off-chain vouchers (no on-chain tx)
const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/resource')
```

- `maxDeposit`: maximum tokens locked in escrow. At $0.01/unit, 1 pathUSD covers 100 requests.
- If the server sets `suggestedDeposit`, the client uses `min(suggestedDeposit, maxDeposit)`.
- Channels remain open for reuse across multiple requests. Close explicitly when done.

## SSE Streaming

Per-token billing over Server-Sent Events enables real-time charging for streamed content.

### Server

```typescript
const mppx = Mppx.create({
  methods: [tempo({ currency: '0x20c0...', recipient: '0x...', sse: true })],
})
export const GET = mppx.session({ amount: '0.001', unitType: 'word' })(
  async () => {
    return async function* (stream) {
      yield JSON.stringify({ title: 'Example' })
      for (const word of words) {
        await stream.charge() // deducts from session balance
        yield word
      }
    }
  }
)
```

### Client

```typescript
const session = tempo.session({ account, maxDeposit: '1' })
const stream = await session.sse('http://localhost:3000/api/poem')
for await (const word of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(word + ' ')
}
const receipt = await session.close()
```

### Streaming Behavior

- `withReceipt` accepts an async generator - each `yield` produces one SSE event and one charge.
- If the balance is exhausted mid-stream, the server emits a `payment-need-voucher` event and pauses until the client sends a new voucher.
- The client SSE handler auto-renews vouchers transparently, so the stream resumes without application-level intervention.

## WebSocket Streaming

WebSocket transport provides bidirectional streaming payments, where voucher delivery and content streaming happen over the same persistent connection (no separate HTTP POSTs for vouchers).

### Server

```typescript
import { Ws } from 'mppx/tempo'
import { Store, tempo } from 'mppx/server'

const wsHandler = Ws.serve({
  methods: [tempo.session({ currency: '0x20c0...', recipient: '0x...', store: Store.redis(redis) })],
  secretKey: process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY!,
  async onMessage(ws, data, stream) {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(data)
    for (const token of generateTokens(parsed.prompt)) {
      await stream.charge()
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ mpp: 'message', data: token }))
    }
  },
})
```

### Message Types

```typescript
// Client → Server
{ mpp: 'authorization', authorization: string }     // Payment credential
{ mpp: 'payment-close-request' }                    // Request channel close

// Server → Client
{ mpp: 'message', data: string }                    // Paid content
{ mpp: 'payment-need-voucher', data: NeedVoucherEvent } // Top-up request
{ mpp: 'payment-receipt', data: SessionReceipt }    // Payment receipt
{ mpp: 'payment-close-ready', data: SessionReceipt } // Close confirmation
{ mpp: 'payment-error', status: number, message: string } // Error
```

### Key Differences from SSE

- **Bidirectional**: Both credential submission and content delivery happen over the same WebSocket connection (SSE uses separate HTTP POST for vouchers)
- **In-band close**: Channel close negotiation happens via WebSocket messages rather than HTTP requests
- **Security hardening**: Close receipts bound to signed close amount, spend committed only on actual delivery, local `maxDeposit` enforced, delivered chunks tracked for fallback close on disconnect

## Channel Recovery After Restarts

Pass `channelId` to `mppx.session()` so returning clients recover existing on-chain channels instead of opening new ones. The `SessionMethodDetails` type has an optional `channelId` field. When included in the 402 challenge, the client SDK's `tryRecoverChannel()` reads on-chain state and resumes the existing channel.

The server doesn't auto-populate this - it's the application's job:

```typescript
import { Credential } from 'mppx'

// Extract channelId from the credential's payload before calling mppx.session()
let channelId: string | undefined
try {
  const credential = Credential.fromRequest(request)
  if (credential.challenge.intent === 'session') {
    const payload = credential.payload as { channelId?: string }
    channelId = payload.channelId
  }
} catch {
  // No credential yet
}

// Pass channelId so the 402 challenge includes it for client-side recovery
const result = await mppx.session({
  amount: tickCost,
  unitType: 'token',
  ...(channelId && { channelId }),
})(request)
```

**Why this matters:** After a server restart, even with a persistent store, the first voucher from a returning client may fail verification (e.g., store was briefly unavailable). Without `channelId` in the re-issued 402 challenge, the client opens a new channel - locking more USDC in escrow while the old deposit sits unclaimed. With `channelId`, the client recovers the existing on-chain channel and continues using it.

## Session Receipts

Session receipts differ from charge receipts:

- `reference` contains `channelId` (a bytes32 hash), not a transaction hash.
- The on-chain settlement transaction hash is only available after the channel closes.
- Calling `close()` returns a receipt that includes the `txHash` of the settlement transaction.

## Store Backends

Sessions require state storage for channel data. Available backends:

| Backend | Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `Store.memory()` | In-memory | Development only, state lost on restart |
| `Store.cloudflare()` | Cloudflare KV | Edge-compatible |
| `Store.upstash()` | Upstash Redis | Serverless Redis |
| Custom | Implement interface | Requires async `get`, `set`, `delete` methods |

## Escrow Contract

The `TempoStreamChannel` on-chain escrow manages deposits, settlements, and refunds.

### Deployed Addresses

- **Mainnet** (chain 4217): `0x33b901018174DDabE4841042ab76ba85D4e24f25`
- **Testnet Moderato** (chain 42431): `0xe1c4d3dce17bc111181ddf716f75bae49e61a336`

### Contract Operations

- **deposit**: Lock tokens into a channel.
- **settle**: Batch-settle vouchers, updating the channel's consumed amount.
- **close**: Final settlement plus refund of unspent tokens to the client. **Payee-only** - only the server (payee) can call this.
- **requestClose**: Payer-initiated close request. Starts a grace period during which the server can still settle outstanding vouchers.
- **withdraw**: Payer reclaims deposit after the grace period expires. Emits `ChannelExpired`.
- **CLOSE_GRACE_PERIOD**: View function returning the grace period duration (900 seconds / 15 minutes on mainnet).

### Payer-Initiated Recovery

If the server is unresponsive or fails to close a channel, the payer can recover locked funds using a two-step process:

1. **`requestClose(channelId)`** - signals intent to close. The server gets a grace period (15 min on mainnet) to settle any outstanding vouchers it holds.
2. **Wait for grace period** - `CLOSE_GRACE_PERIOD()` returns the duration. The `CloseRequested` event includes `closeGraceEnd` timestamp.
3. **`withdraw(channelId)`** - after the grace period, the payer reclaims the full unsettled deposit.

```typescript
import { createClient, encodeFunctionData, http, parseAbi, type Hex } from 'viem'
import { prepareTransactionRequest, readContract, sendRawTransaction, signTransaction } from 'viem/actions'
import { tempo } from 'viem/chains'

const ESCROW = '0x33b901018174DDabE4841042ab76ba85D4e24f25' as Hex
const USDC = '0x20C000000000000000000000b9537d11c60E8b50' as Hex

const abi = parseAbi([
  'function requestClose(bytes32 channelId)',
  'function withdraw(bytes32 channelId)',
  'function CLOSE_GRACE_PERIOD() view returns (uint64)',
  'function channels(bytes32) view returns (bool finalized, uint64 closeRequestedAt, address payer, address payee, address token, address authorizedSigner, uint128 deposit, uint128 settled)',
])

const client = createClient({ account, chain: tempo, transport: http('https://rpc.tempo.xyz') })

// Step 1: Request close
const data = encodeFunctionData({ abi, functionName: 'requestClose', args: [channelId] })
const prepared = await prepareTransactionRequest(client, {
  account, calls: [{ to: ESCROW, data }], feeToken: USDC,
} as never)
const serialized = await signTransaction(client, { ...prepared, account } as never) as Hex
await sendRawTransaction(client, { serializedTransaction: serialized })

// Step 2: Wait for grace period (15 min on mainnet), then withdraw
const withdrawData = encodeFunctionData({ abi, functionName: 'withdraw', args: [channelId] })
// ... same prepare + sign + send pattern
```

Key details:
- `close()` is **payee-only**. Calling it as the payer reverts with `NotPayee()`.
- During the grace period, the server can still call `close()` with the highest voucher to claim earned funds.
- If the server does nothing, `withdraw()` returns the entire unsettled deposit to the payer.
- Tempo transactions use the `calls` pattern and `feeToken` for gas payment in USDC. Use `signTransaction(client, ...)` (not `account.signTransaction`) to get Tempo's custom serializer.
- To find open channels, query `ChannelOpened` events filtered by payer address, then check each channel's state via `channels(channelId)`. Paginate event queries in chunks of 100k blocks (Tempo RPC limit).

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Voucher verification | ~microseconds (single `ecrecover`) |
| RPC calls during session | None (only on open/close/settle) |
| On-chain cost | Amortized: 0.001 USD total vs 0.001 USD per request for charge |
| Throughput | Hundreds of vouchers per second per channel |
