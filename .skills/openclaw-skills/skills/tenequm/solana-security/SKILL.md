# Solana Security Auditing

Systematic security review framework for Solana programs, supporting both Anchor and native Rust implementations.

## Review Process

Follow this systematic 5-step process for comprehensive security audits:

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

Understand the program's context and structure:

- **Framework**: Anchor vs Native Rust (check for `use anchor_lang::prelude::*`)
- **Anchor version**: Check `Cargo.toml` for compatibility and known issues
- **Dependencies**: Oracles (Pyth, Switchboard), external programs, token programs
- **Program structure**: Count instructions, identify account types, analyze state management
- **Complexity**: Lines of code, instruction count, PDA patterns
- **Purpose**: DeFi, NFT, governance, gaming, etc.

### Step 2: Systematic Security Review

For each instruction, perform security checks in this order:

1. **Account Validation** - Verify signer, owner, writable, and initialization checks
2. **Arithmetic Safety** - Check all math operations use `checked_*` methods
3. **PDA Security** - Validate canonical bumps and seed uniqueness
4. **CPI Security** - Ensure cross-program invocations validate target programs
5. **Oracle/External Data** - Verify price staleness and oracle status checks

**→ See [references/security-checklists.md](references/security-checklists.md) for detailed checklists**

### Step 3: Vulnerability Pattern Detection

Scan for common vulnerability patterns:

- Type cosplay attacks
- Account reloading issues
- Improper account closing
- Missing lamports checks
- PDA substitution attacks
- Arbitrary CPI vulnerabilities
- Missing ownership validation
- Integer overflow/underflow

**→ See [references/vulnerability-patterns.md](references/vulnerability-patterns.md) for code examples and exploit scenarios**

### Step 4: Architecture and Testing Review

Evaluate overall design quality:

- PDA design patterns and collision prevention
- Account space allocation and rent exemption
- Error handling approach and coverage
- Event emission for critical state changes
- Compute budget optimization
- Test coverage (unit, integration, fuzz)
- Upgrade strategy and authority management

### Step 5: Generate Security Report

Provide findings using this structure:

**Severity Levels:**
- 🔴 **Critical**: Funds can be stolen/lost, protocol completely broken
- 🟠 **High**: Protocol can be disrupted, partial fund loss possible
- 🟡 **Medium**: Suboptimal behavior, edge cases, griefing attacks
- 🔵 **Low**: Code quality, gas optimization, best practices
- 💡 **Informational**: Recommendations, improvements, documentation

**Finding Format:**
```markdown
## 🔴 [CRITICAL] Title

**Location:** `programs/vault/src/lib.rs:45-52`

**Issue:**
Brief description of the vulnerability

**Vulnerable Code:**
```rust
// Show the problematic code
```

**Exploit Scenario:**
Step-by-step explanation of how this can be exploited

**Recommendation:**
```rust
// Show the secure alternative
```

**References:**
- [Link to relevant documentation or similar exploits]
```

**Report Summary:**
- Total findings by severity
- Critical issues first (prioritize by risk)
- Quick wins (easy fixes with high impact)
- Recommendations for testing improvements

## Quick Reference

### Essential Checks (Every Instruction)

**Anchor:**
```rust
// ✅ Account validation with constraints
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SecureInstruction<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        has_one = authority,  // Relationship check
        seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref()],
        bump,  // Canonical bump
    )]
    pub vault: Account<'info, Vault>,

    pub authority: Signer<'info>,  // Signer required

    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,  // Program validation
}

// ✅ Checked arithmetic
let total = balance.checked_add(amount)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::Overflow)?;
```

**Native Rust:**
```rust
// ✅ Manual account validation
if !authority.is_signer {
    return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
}

if vault.owner != program_id {
    return Err(ProgramError::IllegalOwner);
}

// ✅ Checked arithmetic
let total = balance.checked_add(amount)
    .ok_or(ProgramError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;
```

### Critical Anti-Patterns

❌ **Never Do:**
- Use `saturating_*` arithmetic methods (hide errors)
- Use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code
- Use `init_if_needed` without additional checks
- Skip signer validation ("they wouldn't call this...")
- Use unchecked arithmetic operations
- Allow arbitrary CPI targets
- Forget to reload accounts after mutations

✅ **Always Do:**
- Use `checked_*` arithmetic (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`, etc.)
- Use `ok_or(error)?` for Option unwrapping
- Use explicit `init` with proper validation
- Require `Signer<'info>` or `is_signer` checks
- Use `Program<'info, T>` for CPI program validation
- Reload accounts after external calls that mutate state
- Validate account ownership, discriminators, and relationships

## Framework-Specific Patterns

### Anchor Security Patterns

**→ See [references/anchor-security.md](references/anchor-security.md) for:**
- Account constraint best practices
- Common Anchor-specific vulnerabilities
- Secure CPI patterns with `CpiContext`
- Event emission and monitoring
- Custom error handling

### Native Rust Security Patterns

**→ See [references/native-security.md](references/native-security.md) for:**
- Manual account validation patterns
- Secure PDA derivation and signing
- Low-level CPI security
- Account discriminator patterns
- Rent exemption validation

## Modern Practices (2025)

- **Use Anchor 0.30+** for latest security features
- **Implement Token-2022** with proper extension handling
- **Use `InitSpace` derive** for automatic space calculation
- **Emit events** for all critical state changes
- **Write fuzz tests** with Trident framework
- **Document invariants** in code comments
- **Follow progressive roadmap**: Dev → Audit → Testnet → Audit → Mainnet

## Key Questions for Every Audit

Always verify these critical security properties:

1. **Can an attacker substitute accounts?**
   - PDA validation, program ID checks, has_one constraints

2. **Can arithmetic overflow or underflow?**
   - All math uses checked operations, division by zero protected

3. **Are all accounts properly validated?**
   - Owner, signer, writable, initialized checks present

4. **Can the program be drained?**
   - Authorization checks, reentrancy protection, account confusion prevention

5. **What happens in edge cases?**
   - Zero amounts, max values, closed accounts, expired data

6. **Are external dependencies safe?**
   - Oracle validation (staleness, status), CPI targets verified, token program checks

## Audit Workflow

### Before Starting

1. Understand the protocol purpose and mechanics
2. Review documentation and specifications
3. Set up local development environment
4. Run existing tests and check coverage

### During Audit

1. Follow the 5-step review process systematically
2. Document findings with severity and remediation
3. Create proof-of-concept exploits for critical issues
4. Test fixes and verify they work

### After Audit

1. Present findings clearly prioritized by severity
2. Provide actionable remediation steps
3. Re-audit after fixes are implemented
4. Document lessons learned for the protocol

## Testing for Security

Beyond code review, validate security through testing:

- **Unit tests**: Test each instruction's edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Test cross-instruction interactions
- **Fuzz testing**: Use Trident to discover unexpected behaviors
- **Exploit scenarios**: Write POCs for found vulnerabilities
- **Upgrade testing**: Verify migration paths are secure

## Core Principle

**In Solana's account model, attackers can pass arbitrary accounts to any instruction.**

Security requires explicitly validating:
- ✅ Every account's ownership
- ✅ Every account's type (discriminator)
- ✅ Every account's relationships
- ✅ Every account's state
- ✅ Every signer requirement
- ✅ Every arithmetic operation
- ✅ Every external call

There are no implicit guarantees. **Validate everything, trust nothing.**
