## Quick Navigation

Load the relevant reference file based on the task:

### Plugin & Extension System
- **`references/plugin-system.md`** - Plugin discovery, loading, manifest format, registration API, installation CLI, SDK exports. Read when building/debugging plugins or understanding how extensions are loaded.

### Configuration
- **`references/configuration.md`** - Full config structure (`OpenClawConfig`), config paths, file format (JSON5), env var substitution, `$include` directives, validation (Zod), per-plugin config, programmatic read/write. Read when modifying or generating openclaw config.

### Boot & Provisioning
- **`references/boot-provisioning.md`** - Gateway startup sequence, BOOT.md mechanism, onboarding flows (interactive/non-interactive), plugin loading during boot, sidecar startup order, health checks. Read when designing automated provisioning or debugging startup.

### Channels & Extensions
- **`references/channels-extensions.md`** - All built-in channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, WhatsApp, Web) + extension channels (MS Teams, Matrix, Zalo, Voice Call, Feishu). Channel plugin registration, per-channel config, Telegram specifics. Read when adding/configuring channels.

### Models & Providers
- **`references/models-providers.md`** - Provider configuration, `models.mode` (merge/replace), x402 providers, model catalog structure, provider registration via plugins. Read when configuring model access or building provider plugins.

### CLI Commands
- **`references/cli-commands.md`** - Key CLI commands for config, plugins, channels, agents, onboarding, gateway, skills. Read when scripting openclaw setup or building automation.

### GitHub Context (live issues, PRs, gotchas)
- **`references/github-context.md`** - Open bugs, breaking changes, recent impactful PRs, plugin/config known issues, dev gotchas synthesized from GitHub. Refreshed via `/refresh-openclaw`. Read before starting any non-trivial openclaw work to avoid known pitfalls.
