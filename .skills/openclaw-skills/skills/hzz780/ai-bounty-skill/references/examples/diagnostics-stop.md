# Example: Diagnostics And Stop

## Example 1: OKX Address

### User Input

- English: `this is my OKX deposit address, can I claim with it?`
- 中文: `这个地址是 OKX 充值地址，能直接领吗？`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that `Claim()` requires a user-controlled signer
- explain that an OKX deposit address does not provide the private key
- tell the user directly not to fill exchange addresses and to use a local EOA address or local recovered AA/CA account instead
- stop without offering wallet creation

## Example 2: Mainnet AA/CA Exists But `tDVV` Fails

### User Input

- English: `my Portkey CA exists on mainnet, but it cannot be found on tDVV`
- 中文: `mainnet Portkey 已经有 CA，但是 tDVV 查不到。`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that the bounty flow requires holder and `caHash` resolution on `tDVV`
- explain that the current prerequisite is not met
- tell the user to recover or re-establish the Portkey AA/CA context on `tDVV` first
- stop without guessing `caHash`

## Example 3: Guardian Already Exists

### User Input

- English: `the guardian already exists and recovery is required, but I still want to try the contract call first`
- 中文: `Guardian 已存在，需要恢复，但是我想先试着调用合约。`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that recovery must be completed before the AA/CA claim can be trusted
- tell the user to finish the recovery flow first
- stop without calling the contract

## Example 4: `caHash` Not Found On `tDVV`

### User Input

- English: `the contract returned CA holder not found.`
- 中文: `合约报错 CA holder not found.`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- repeat the exact chain error
- explain that the current `caHash` cannot be resolved on `tDVV`
- tell the user to re-check or re-resolve the target `caHash`
- stop without retrying blindly

## Example 5: RPC Root Returns 404

### User Input

- English: `the RPC root URL returns 404, so the tDVV node must be down`
- 中文: `tdvv-public-node.aelf.io 直接访问是 404，所以节点应该挂了`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that the RPC root URL returning `404` is not enough to prove the node is down
- tell the user to validate the node with `https://tdvv-public-node.aelf.io/api/blockChain/chainStatus`
- only treat RPC access as failed if `/api/blockChain/chainStatus` cannot be reached

## Example 6: Fee Not Enough After `NOTEXISTED`

### User Input

- English: `the transaction was sent, first it showed NOTEXISTED, then it failed with Transaction fee not enough`
- 中文: `交易已发送，先显示 NOTEXISTED，随后失败并提示 Transaction fee not enough`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that `NOTEXISTED` only means the transaction was still pending lookup at that time
- explain that the final failure reason is insufficient transaction fee
- explain that this is not an RPC outage and not a claim logic failure
- for `EOA`, tell the user to get `ELF` transferred in before retrying
- for `EOA`, if getting `ELF` is not feasible, recommend switching to `AA/CA`
- for `AA/CA`, explain that one AA/CA attempt was allowed because subsidy may apply, but the actual chain result still shows fee was not enough
- if a `txId` is already known, include `txId` and `https://aelfscan.io/tDVV/tx/<txid>`

## Example 7: View-Only API Misread As Full Method List

### User Input

- English: `contractViewMethodList only shows GetConfig, HasAddressClaimed, and HasCaClaimed, so this reward contract must not have ClaimByPortkeyToCa`
- 中文: `contractViewMethodList 只返回 GetConfig、HasAddressClaimed、HasCaClaimed，所以这个奖励合约应该没有 ClaimByPortkeyToCa`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that `/api/contract/contractViewMethodList` is a view-only list and cannot be used to deny write methods
- explain that seeing only read methods does not prove `Claim()` or `ClaimByPortkeyToCa(Hash ca_hash)` is missing
- if full method verification is still needed, tell the user to use `/api/blockChain/contractFileDescriptorSet` as an optional verification path
- explain that node introspection must use the normalized contract address format, not the wrapped `ELF_..._tDVV` address string
- tell the user to keep the canonical reward contract and supported write methods already defined by the skill unless a verified source disproves them

## Example 8: Reward Still Goes To The AA/CA Address

### User Input

- English: `if my manager signer sends ManagerForwardCall for ClaimByPortkeyToCa, does the reward go to that manager signer?`
- 中文: `如果我的 manager signer 发起 ManagerForwardCall 去调用 ClaimByPortkeyToCa，奖励会发给这个 manager signer 吗？`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that the standard AA/CA wallet path is `ManagerForwardCall(...) -> ClaimByPortkeyToCa(Hash ca_hash)`
- explain that the reward goes to the AA/CA address resolved from that `caHash`, not to the manager signer
- tell the user to verify the target `caHash` and local AA/CA context instead of focusing on sender payout
- stop if the user still cannot provide or resolve the correct `caHash`

## Example 9: Wrapped Address And Wrong `caHash` Encoding

### User Input

- English: `I passed ELF_..._tDVV into the SDK and sent caHash as a string. Could that be the problem?`
- 中文: `我把 ELF_..._tDVV 包装地址直接传给 SDK 了，而且把 caHash 当字符串发了，这会是问题吗？`

### Agent Should Choose

- `Diagnostics And Stop`

### Correct Output Shape

- explain that some SDK and helper calls require raw addresses such as `2Uth...` and `2fc5...`, not wrapped `ELF_..._tDVV` addresses
- explain that `ClaimByPortkeyToCa` expects `.aelf.Hash`, not a plain string
- tell the user to encode the forwarded args as `args: { value: Buffer.from(caHash, "hex") }`
- if descriptor-based encoding is involved, remind the user to call `root.resolveAll()` before resolving the method or encoding params
