## Daily Workflow (~30 minutes)

**Goal**: Produce a daily briefing covering the last 24 hours.
**Output Template**: `Standard Format` or `Brief Format`
**Best Time**: Morning (8:00–9:00 AM)

---

### Step 1: Search & Discover (10 min)

**Use**: `search_queries.md` → **Recipe A: Daily Briefing**

Execute the 5 queries in order:

| # | Query Focus | Action |
|---|-------------|--------|
| Q1 | General embodied AI news | Scan top 10 results, bookmark relevant |
| Q2 | Foundation model / algorithm news | Scan top 10, bookmark papers & announcements |
| Q3 | Key company names | Scan top 10, bookmark demos & updates |
| Q4 | Funding & startup news | Scan top 10, bookmark deals |
| Q5 | Core media sites | Scan headlines on Robot Report & IEEE Spectrum |

**Output of this step**: A raw list of 10–20 bookmarked URLs.

---

### Step 2: Browse Priority Sources (10 min)

**Use**: `news_sources.md` → **Tier 1 (Core Media)** + **Tier 2 (Company Blogs)**

| Source | Action | Time |
|--------|--------|------|
| The Robot Report | Scan homepage headlines | 2 min |
| IEEE Spectrum Robotics | Scan latest articles | 2 min |
| TechCrunch Robotics | Check for funding/launch news | 1 min |
| Tesla AI (X/Twitter) | Check for Optimus updates | 1 min |
| Figure AI / 1X / Unitree (X) | Check for new demos | 2 min |
| QbitAI (量子位) | Scan for China ecosystem news | 2 min |

**Output of this step**: Additional 5–10 URLs added to the raw list. Duplicates removed.

---

### Step 2b: GitHub Hot Repos (Optional, +5–10 min)

**When**: User asked for GitHub / 开源仓库雷达, or weekly/monthly brief explicitly includes open-source momentum.

**Use**: `search_queries.md` → **Recipe F** + `github_repos.md` (full G1–G5 procedure).

**Output**: 5–8 verified `https://github.com/owner/repo` rows for **`output_templates.md`** → **⭐ GitHub 热门开源** (place before Key Takeaways).

---

### Step 3: Classify & Prioritize (5 min)

Sort all collected stories into the following categories:

| Category | Icon | Priority Criteria |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Major Announcements | 🔥 | New product launch, major demo, paradigm shift |
| Foundation Models & Algorithms | 🧠 | New model release, SOTA result, open-source drop |
| Hardware & Platforms | 🦾 | New robot, component breakthrough, spec upgrade |
| Deployments & Commercial | 🏭 | Real-world deployment, customer announcement |
| Simulation & Infrastructure | 🌐 | Sim platform update, new benchmark, dataset |
| Funding & M&A | 💰 | Funding round, acquisition, IPO |
| Policy, Safety & Ethics | 🌍 | Regulation, safety standard, export control |
| China Ecosystem | 🇨🇳 | China-specific company, policy, or supply chain |

**Prioritization rules:**
1. **Lead story**: The single most impactful news item → goes to "Major Announcements"
2. **Must-include**: Any story with >3 sources covering it
3. **Skip**: Press releases with no substance, duplicate coverage, tangentially related stories
4. **Target**: 5–8 stories total for a daily briefing

**Output of this step**: A classified, prioritized list of 5–8 stories with categories assigned.

---

### Step 4: Generate Output (5 min)

**Use**: `output_templates.md` → **Standard Format** (default) or **Brief Format** (if time-constrained)

For each story, fill in the template fields:

```
For Standard Format, each story needs:
├── Headline
├── Summary (1 sentence)
├── Key Points (2-3 bullets)
├── Domain-specific metadata
│   ├── Robot/Platform (if applicable)
│   ├── Tech Stack (if applicable)
│   ├── Model Type / Hardware Type / Deployment Scale (by category)
│   └── Open Source status (for research stories)
├── Impact (1-2 sentences)
├── Source + Date
└── Link
```

**Final checks before publishing:**
- [ ] All links are working
- [ ] Dates are accurate

## Automation Opportunities

### What Can Be Automated
| Task | Tool / Method | Difficulty |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Query execution | Google Alerts, RSS feeds, custom scripts | Easy |
| arXiv paper monitoring | Semantic Scholar alerts, arxiv-sanity | Easy |
| Social media monitoring | X/Twitter lists, Nuzzel-like tools | Easy |
| Story deduplication | URL matching, title similarity | Medium |
| Category classification | LLM-based classification prompt | Medium |
| Template filling | LLM with structured output | Medium |
| Trend detection | Keyword frequency analysis over time | Hard |

### Recommended Automation Stack
```
Layer 1 — Ingestion:
├── Google Alerts (general queries, daily email digest)
├── RSS Reader (Feedly / Inoreader) for Tier 1 & Tier 2 sources
├── Semantic Scholar Alerts (arXiv paper tracking)
└── X/Twitter Lists (company accounts + key researchers)

Layer 2 — Processing:
├── LLM (classify, summarize, extract metadata)
├── Deduplication (URL + title matching)
└── Priority scoring (source tier × recency × discussion volume)

Layer 3 — Output:
├── Template rendering (fill output_templates.md)
├── Distribution (email, Slack, Notion, blog)
└── Archive (searchable database of past briefings)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Too few results | Queries too narrow | Expand date range; use broader terms; check more sources |
| Too many results | Queries too broad | Add NOT filters; narrow date range; add domain-specific terms |
| Missing China news | English-only queries | Add Chinese keywords; check QbitAI/Synced directly |
| Stale company blogs | Infrequent posting | Rely on X/Twitter + media coverage instead |
| Duplicate stories | Multiple outlets covering same event | Deduplicate by topic, keep the most detailed source |
| Can't assess paper importance | No citation data yet (preprint) | Use X/Twitter discussion volume as a proxy |
| Template too long | Too many stories included | Use Brief format; raise the inclusion threshold to top 5 only |
