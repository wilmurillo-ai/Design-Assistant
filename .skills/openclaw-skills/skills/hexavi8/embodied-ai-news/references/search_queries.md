## 12. Query Optimization Tips for Embodied AI

### Terminology Precision
| ❌ Too Broad | ✅ Precise |
|-------------|-----------|
| `"robot news"` | `"humanoid robot" OR "embodied AI"` |
| `"AI model"` | `"VLA model" OR "diffusion policy" OR "robot foundation model"` |
| `"robot arm"` | `"dexterous manipulation" OR "mobile manipulator"` |
| `"simulation"` | `"Isaac Sim" OR "MuJoCo" OR "sim-to-real"` |

### Noise Exclusion Patterns
```
# Exclude industrial-only / non-AI robotics
NOT "Roomba" NOT "RPA" NOT "software robot" NOT "chatbot" NOT "trading bot"

# Exclude adjacent but different fields
NOT "autonomous vehicle" NOT "self-driving" NOT "drone delivery"
(unless specifically tracking these intersections)
```

### Chinese Content Search Tips
- Use **both English and Chinese** terms for Chinese companies: `"Unitree" OR "宇树"`
- For policy: `"具身智能" OR "人形机器人" OR "embodied AI China"`
- Best Chinese search engines: **Baidu News**, **WeChat Search (搜狗微信)**
- For English coverage of China: `site:syncedreview.com` or `"China" AND "humanoid robot"`

### Date Range Guidelines
| Content Type | Recommended Range | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Breaking news & demos | `after:[today - 1d]` | Fast-moving announcements |
| Research papers | `after:[today - 7d]` | Papers accumulate weekly |
| Funding rounds | `after:[today - 7d]` | Deal flow is weekly cadence |
| Hardware launches | `after:[today - 7d]` | Product cycles are slower |
| Policy & regulation | `after:[today - 30d]` | Policy moves slowly |
| Market reports | `after:[today - 30d]` | Published monthly/quarterly |
| Supply chain | `after:[today - 30d]` | Long-cycle industry |
