# Agent Stability Framework (ASF) — Gumroad Listing

## Headline

**Drift prevention, fault catching, and soul alignment for AI agents. Three failure modes, three defenses, one integrated system.**

---

## Description

AI agents fail in three distinct ways, and most people only catch one of them.

**Drift:** Your agent gradually reverts to generic training defaults. The personality you defined erodes over sessions. It starts sounding like every other AI assistant.

**Faults:** Your agent hallucinates data, contradicts itself, fails silently at tasks, or acts outside its authority. These are discrete, objective failures.

**Soul misalignment:** Your agent passes every technical check but doesn't feel right. It's correct but characterless. The vibe shifted.

ASF addresses all three with one integrated system. Define your agent's identity in a SOUL.md file. Document 10+ correct responses as baseline examples. Add standing orders (binary rules — pass or fail, no judgment calls), a pre-send gate (delete triggers checked before every output), and fault detection rules to your system prompt. Run periodic audits with a 10-point scorecard.

Binary rules beat vague instructions. "NEVER validate the user's decisions" works consistently. "Try to be authentic" doesn't. Every rule in ASF is binary.

Examples anchor identity better than descriptions. When your agent checks its response against concrete baseline examples instead of abstract personality descriptions, drift detection actually catches things.

Logging creates memory across sessions. Agents forget between restarts. Fault logs and stability logs don't. Patterns in logs become standing orders. Standing orders become permanent behavior.

Works on every LLM tested: Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini, Llama, Mistral. Setup takes 45-90 minutes. Daily maintenance takes 5 minutes.

## Who This Is For

- Anyone running AI agents that need consistent personality across sessions
- Developers building agents that must not hallucinate or contradict themselves
- Teams deploying 24/7 autonomous agents where drift compounds over days
- People who've noticed their agent "doesn't sound right" but couldn't pinpoint why

## CRUCIBLE-Verified

Built and battle-tested over 130+ message extreme-length sessions. The three-layer defense model was developed through iterative production failures — each layer exists because the other two weren't sufficient alone.
