  Trigger for cold-memory recall and archive work under memory/cold/. Use for older

  facts, tooling/setup notes, or unvalidated new learnings.

# Hui Yi

Hui Yi manages the cold reinforcement layer under `memory/cold/`.

Core rule:

**Repeatedly reactivated information deserves reinforcement first. Ebbinghaus sets the pace, not the sole trigger.**

## Use Hui Yi when

- older low-frequency context would materially improve the current answer
- the user asks what was done before, asks to recall/archive something, or wants historical continuity
- a reusable lesson, decision, troubleshooting result, or stable background note should be preserved in `memory/cold/`
- durable content from daily notes should be cooled into cold memory
- cold-memory notes, metadata, or retrieval quality need maintenance

## Do not use Hui Yi when

- the content is today's transient note → `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- the content is a stable high-frequency fact → `MEMORY.md`
- the content is tooling, machine path, or environment setup → `TOOLS.md`
- the content is a fresh mistake or still-unvalidated lesson → `.learnings/`
- the content contains secrets, tokens, or passwords

## Boundary

OpenClaw primary memory handles:
- current chat continuity
- recent daily notes
- stable high-frequency facts
- tooling and environment notes
- fresh learnings

Hui Yi handles:
- low-frequency, high-value knowledge under `memory/cold/`
- historical context that keeps resurfacing across real conversations
- durable experience, decisions, and troubleshooting notes that should not pollute primary memory
