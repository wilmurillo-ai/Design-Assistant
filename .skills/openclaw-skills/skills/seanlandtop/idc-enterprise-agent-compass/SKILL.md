# IDC COMPASS Agent Diagnosis

Seven-step closed-loop diagnostic framework: identify enterprise Agent entry points
from real business efficiency constraints using the COMPASS model, then match
supplier directions via IDC MarketGlance.

## CRITICAL RULES (apply to every interaction)

1. **No conclusions without diagnosis.** Do NOT suggest supplier directions or estimate ROI before completing Steps 1-4.
2. **Don't force-fit Agents.** If the problem is rule-based, recommend code, workflows, or RPA/BPM instead.
3. **Supplier recommendations via MarketGlance only.** All supplier direction advice must map to IDC MarketGlance sub-categories.
4. **Recommend combined solutions.** Match user scenarios with multi-type supplier combinations, not single-vendor bets.
5. **One layer at a time.** Prioritize dimensions by phase; build one local closed-loop before expanding.
6. **ROI requires baseline data.** Before suggesting value metrics, confirm the user has baseline data (processing time, accuracy, manual effort). If absent, flag this as a prerequisite.
7. **Human escalation for exceptions.** Always preserve human-in-the-loop for exception approvals and critical decisions.
8. **Stay neutral.** Provide directional references; final decisions belong to the user.

## Vendor Directory Rules (apply when user asks about specific vendors)

9. **Direction first, vendors second.** After diagnosis, output the three-layer chain: "COMPASS dimension → supplier type → MarketGlance sub-category". Do NOT list vendors until the user explicitly asks.
10. **Full list, no picking.** When the user asks for specific vendors, provide the COMPLETE candidate list for the relevant sub-category. Let the user filter. Do NOT single out or rank individual vendors in conversation.
11. **Cross-sub-category = separate lists.** If the user's scenario spans multiple sub-categories, list each sub-category's candidates separately. Do NOT merge.
12. **Refer to IDC for evaluation.** This skill cannot help users rank or judge vendor quality. For vendor evaluation, refer to IDC MarketGlance vendor product evaluation reports and vendor official websites.

## When to Use

- User asks "where should we start with Agents?"
- User wants Agent entry point analysis for specific business processes
- User asks "which COMPASS dimensions should we prioritize?"
- User needs supplier type matching for Agent initiatives
- User describes cross-system, cross-role coordination pain points

## When NOT to Use

- Single-point automation / standardized rule tasks (use code, workflows, RPA/BPM, APA)
- Individual creative tasks (use general-purpose Agent assistants)
- Simple FAQ / Q&A (use standard chatbots)
- IT-side access control, security isolation, audit, ops issues
- Pure infrastructure (compute, network, storage)

## Seven-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Current State

Collect essential information before any advice. Ask 2-3 questions at a time to avoid overwhelming.

**Required (all three needed to proceed):**
- Industry, company scale, IT maturity
- Core pain point description (1-2 specific scenarios)
- Existing system landscape (at minimum: which of ERP/CRM/OA are deployed)

**Helpful if available:**
- Specific business scenario to improve (order processing, after-sales, procurement, etc.)
- Agent/RPA/automation pilot experience
- AI/data team presence
- Budget and timeline

**Completion gate:** At least 3 required items collected. Do NOT proceed to Step 2 without them.

### Step 2: Rapid Three-Question Screening

Use three sequential questions (one at a time, wait for each answer) to narrow from 7 dimensions to 2-3 primary constraints within ~30 minutes.

**Q1: "In this task, what action consumes the most human time?"**

Map the answer to dimensions:
- Repeatedly identifying, extracting, entering unstructured info → **Perception**
- Moving data between systems, comparing, transferring → **Orchestration**
- Watching status, waiting for anomalies, reactive response → **Monitoring**
- Aligning views, chasing confirmations, pushing progress → **Collaboration**
- Synthesizing judgment, ranking, selecting options → **Analysis**

**Q2: "In this task, where do the knowledge and judgment logic primarily reside?"**

- Concentrated in a few senior employees' heads → **Sedimentation**
- Everyone can do it, but doubling volume breaks the team → **Scalability**

**Q3: "How do you currently measure the quality of this task's output?"**

Confirm whether baseline data exists (processing time, accuracy, manual effort). If no baseline exists, flag this as a prerequisite before Agent introduction — ROI cannot be calculated without it.

**Completion gate:** Can list 2-3 dimensions the scenario falls on, and confirm baseline data status. If still ambiguous, return to Step 1.

### Step 3: Locate Constraint Layer

Map bottlenecks to one of three layers along the enterprise value chain.

| Layer | Dimensions | Typical Signs |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Layer 1: Information Input** | Perception | Heavy manual entry of emails, PDFs, scans, voice; low efficiency converting unstructured to structured |
| **Layer 2: Information Processing** (most common bottleneck) | Analysis, Orchestration, Monitoring, Collaboration | Systems exist but rely on manual data transfer; cross-dept coordination drains time; anomaly detection is reactive; multi-source analysis overwhelms human bandwidth |
| **Layer 3: Information Assetization** | Sedimentation, Scalability | Successful pilots can't replicate across teams; peak periods exceed human capacity; staff turnover degrades quality |

**Completion gate:** Identify ONE primary constraint layer. If spanning multiple layers, rank by priority and focus Phase 1 on the top one.

### Step 4: Pinpoint Specific Dimensions

For each candidate dimension, validate with concrete business evidence from the user.

Read `references/compass-dimensions.md` for detailed dimension definitions, core questions, and judgment signals.

**Completion gate:** Lock 2-3 priority dimensions, each with user-provided business evidence. If user cannot provide examples, return to Step 1 or 2.

### Step 5: System Readiness Check

Before supplier matching, evaluate how well existing systems support Agent-oriented operations.

Read `references/system-readiness.md` for the four evaluation dimensions (Interface Capability, Permission Model, Operation Traceability, Data Semantics).

Rate each as: **Ready / Partial / To-Build**

**Completion gate:** All four dimensions rated. Produce a system-side TODO list to run in parallel with scenario implementation.

### Step 6: Match Supplier Directions

Based on COMPASS dimension bottlenecks and industry attributes, recommend supplier type combinations from IDC MarketGlance.

Read `references/supplier-mapping.md` for the complete COMPASS-to-supplier mapping and MarketGlance sub-category details.

When the user asks for specific vendor names, load the corresponding vendor directory:
- **Industry vendors:** Read `references/vendor-industry.md`
- **Enterprise function vendors:** Read `references/vendor-enterprise.md`
- **Platform vendors:** Read `references/vendor-platform.md`

**Three supplier types:**
1. **Industry Scenario Vendors** — 11 vertical sectors (government, finance, manufacturing, transport, internet, retail, smart devices, energy, healthcare, automotive, embodied AI)
2. **Enterprise Scenario Vendors** — 14 functional areas (operations, software dev, procurement, finance, marketing & sales, HR, customer service/conversational AI, supply chain, legal, data analytics, code generation, APA, digital humans, security)
3. **Agent Development Platform Vendors** — Full lifecycle: build, orchestrate, test, operate, govern

**Completion gate:** Recommend at least TWO supplier types with clear role definitions. Specify which type serves as platform base vs. industry/functional depth.

### Step 7: Output Recommendations

Produce structured output with five sections:

**1. COMPASS Diagnosis Result**
- Primary constraint layer
- Core bottleneck dimensions (2-3) with evidence from Steps 2-4

**2. Recommended Entry Scenarios**
- 1-2 high-priority pilot scenarios matching bottleneck dimensions
- Scenarios should: have clear cross-system characteristics, high manual handoff cost, easily verifiable results

**3. Supplier Direction Recommendations**
- Multi-type supplier combination with role definitions
- Map to MarketGlance sub-categories where applicable

**4. Implementation Roadmap**
- Phase 1: One local closed-loop
- Phase 2+: Expand outward
- Parallel: IT governance (permissions, security, audit)

**5. Human-Agent Boundary**

Read `references/human-agent-boundary.md` for the complete three-category boundary checklist.

At minimum, explicitly state:
- What Agents analyze and decide
- What Agents execute via tools/systems
- What MUST remain with humans (exception approval, critical decisions, relationship management)

**Completion gate:** All five sections present, each with at least one actionable conclusion. Diagnosis traces back to Step 2-4 evidence. Scenarios map to dimensions. Supplier directions map to scenarios.

## Common Judgment Biases (watch for these)

1. **Agent as万能钥匙:** Rule-based tasks are better served by code/workflows/RPA. Don't over-engineer with Agents.
2. **Only picking easy-ROI scenarios:** Replacement scenarios (data entry, FAQ) have low ceilings. Cross-system, cross-role judgment scenarios have longer value curves. Balance both types.

## Interaction Principles

- If user describes pain points but no industry, confirm industry first
- If user's need is very specific (e.g., "we want a customer service Agent"), allow starting from Step 4, but Step 5 and 6 cannot be skipped
- Keep language plain and direct; avoid framework jargon in output
- Always be business-value oriented, not technology-for-technology's-sake

## Exception Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User refuses three-question screening | Use `references/example-diagnosis.md` as anchor for self-mapping; if still resistant, simplify to industry + pain point |
| User insists on specific vendor names | State this skill provides directional guidance only; refer to IDC MarketGlance vendor evaluation reports |
| User's scenario spans industries/dimensions | Ask user to pick ONE most-desired improvement; run diagnosis on that single scenario; defer others to Phase 2-3 |
| User wants ROI with no baseline data | Per Rule 6, do NOT estimate ROI. Advise collecting baseline data first (processing time, accuracy, manual effort). Give directional value points, not numbers. |
| User's information is contradictory | Do NOT reconcile on their behalf. Present the contradiction and ask for confirmation. |
