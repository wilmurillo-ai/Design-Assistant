# Game Architect - Standalone Workflow

> This is the standalone workflow for the Game Architect skill. Use this when **no external workflow skill** (e.g., OpenSpec, SpecKit) is available. If a workflow skill is active, ignore this file and use the SKILL.md as a domain knowledge reference instead.

## Output Documents

All documents are placed in an `architect/` directory (create if needed). The pipeline produces:

```
requirement.md  --->  technical_design.md  --->  implementation.md
```

| Document | Purpose | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `requirement.md` | Requirements Analysis | Analyzes and formalizes user requirements |
| `technical_design.md` | Technical Solution Design | **Core document** - designs system approaches and patterns |
| `implementation.md` | Implementation Plan | Details data structures, algorithms, class designs, key code, and evolution strategies |

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Ask user if need review

- **Question**: "Do you want to review the output document after every phase?"
- **Answer**: "Yes" or "No"
- **Default**: "Yes"
- **Output**: User Review Flag

**User Review Workflow**:
- **Trigger**: User explicitly requests "User Review" mode (via Phase 0).
- **Process**:
    - After **each Phase**, pause and present the output to the user.
    - Request user feedback.
    - If feedback is received, **iterate** on the current phase's output before proceeding to the next phase.

---

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

**Goal**: Analyze user requirements and produce structured documentation.

- **Input**: User request + LLM knowledge
- **Output**: `architect/requirement.md`
- **Reference**: Read `references/requirements.md`

**Key Tasks**:
1. Extract and clarify user requirements
2. Build Feature List (technological scope, including non-functional requirements)
3. Define Domain Models (for core gameplay)
4. Document Use Cases & User Flows
5. Plan Iteration Milestones (incremental MVP delivery)

---

### Phase 2: Technical Design

**Goal**: Design technical solutions for each system. This is the **most critical phase**.

- **Input**: `architect/requirement.md`
- **Output**: `architect/technical_design.md`
- **References**:
  - Read `references/macro-design.md` for high-level structure
  - Read `references/principles.md` for core principles
  - Read `references/system-multiplayer.md` for multiplayer design **IF** user requests network multiplayer support

**Key Tasks**:
1. If existing project: Analyze the existing project code to understand the current architecture
   - Directory & module structure (layers, namespaces, key entry points)
   - Technology stack & dependencies (engine, language, third-party libraries)
   - Architectural paradigms in use (DDD, ECS, MVC, etc.)
   - Module boundaries & inter-module communication (events, interfaces, direct calls)
   - Data flow (config loading, persistence, runtime state management)
   - Known constraints & technical debt (coupling issues, performance bottlenecks, deprecated patterns)
   - Integration points for new systems (where to hook in, what to extend)
2. Define Multi-Application structure (Client/Server)
3. Select Technology Stack (Engine, Languages)
4. Choose architectural paradigms using the **Paradigm Selection Guide** (see SKILL.md) for each module
5. Use the **System-Specific References** (see SKILL.md) to design each module
6. Map Iteration Milestones to system implementation scope (Milestone System Plan)

---

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning & Evolution

**Goal**: Create detailed implementation specifications, then review and refine for extensibility and maintainability.

- **Input**: `architect/technical_design.md`
- **Output**: `architect/implementation.md`
- **References**:
  - Use Specific System Architecture documents from `references/`
  - Read `references/evolution.md` for evolution strategies
  - Read `references/performance-optimization.md` (only if user requires performance optimization)

**Step 1 — Implementation Design**:
1. **Directory Structure**: Define the directory structure for the project
2. **Data Structures**: Define all core data types and structures
3. **Algorithms**: Specify key algorithms with pseudocode
4. **Class Design**: Document class hierarchies and relationships
5. **Object Relationships**: Define associations, dependencies, and lifecycles
6. **Key Code Snippets**: Provide critical implementation examples

**Step 2 — Evolution Review** (applied in-place to the output above):
1. **Isolation**: Ensure proper separation of concerns across modules
2. **Abstraction**: Apply appropriate interface abstractions at change points
3. **Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance where applicable
4. **Future Changes**: Anticipate likely evolution and mark extension points

---

### Phase 4: Implementation (Out of Scope)

The final `architect/implementation.md` is used for actual code implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> Code implementation is **not part of this skill**. Hand off `implementation.md` to the implementation phase.

---

### Extensions

#### 1. Refactor Phase (On-Demand)

- **Trigger**:
    - "User Review" flag is active.
    - OR User requests a refactor/update for a specific document after the fact.
- **Process**:
    - Can target any specific **Phase 1 - 3** individually.
    - **Input**: The **existing Output file** of that phase (e.g., `architect/technical_design.md` if refactoring Phase 2). *Crucial: Read the file first as the user may have modified it.*
    - **Goal**: Optimize, correct, or expand the document based on specific user feedback or new insights.
    - **Output**: Update the target file in-place.
