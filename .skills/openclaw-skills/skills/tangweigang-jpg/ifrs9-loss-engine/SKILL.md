# ifrs9-loss-engine

> I help you build quant strategies on A-share with ZVT — from data fetch to backtest, one flow. Just tell me what you want; I'll write the code, you don't have to dig docs. (Heads up: ZVT natively supports A-share, HK, and crypto. US stocks — stockus_nasdaq_AAPL — are half-baked; don't bother for serious work.)

## Pipeline

`data_collection -> data_storage -> factor_computation -> target_selection -> trading_execution -> visualization`

## Top Use Cases (42 total)

### ECL Limit Level Truncation Analysis (`UC-101`)
Calculates Expected Credit Loss (ECL) at the limit/tranche level by computing remaining tenor and projecting loan balances with interest, supporting I
**Triggers**: ECL, Expected Credit Loss, limit level

### Loan Amortization Schedule Calculator (`UC-102`)
Computes loan amortization schedules by iteratively calculating interest amounts and remaining balances after each payment, determining total repaymen
**Triggers**: amortization, loan, payment schedule

### Amortization Schedule with NumPy Financial (`UC-103`)
Generates amortization schedules using numpy-financial library functions (PMT, PPMT, IPMT) for calculating periodic payments, principal, and interest
**Triggers**: amortization, numpy-financial, PMT

For all **42** use cases, see [references/USE_CASES.md](references/USE_CASES.md).

## Install

```bash
# One-time setup before first use
bash scripts/install.sh
```

**Execute trigger**: `When user intent matches intent_router.uc_entries[].positive_terms AND user uses action verb (run/execute/跑/执行/backtest/fetch/collect)`

## What I'll Ask You

- Target market: A-share (default), HK, or crypto? (US stocks in ZVT are half-baked — stockus_nasdaq_AAPL exists but coverage is thin)
- Data source / provider: eastmoney (free, no account), joinquant (account+paid), baostock (free, good history), akshare, or qmt (broker)?
- Strategy type: MACD golden-cross, MA crossover, volume breakout, fundamental screen, or custom factor?
- Time range: start_timestamp and end_timestamp for backtest period
- Target entity IDs: specific stocks (stock_sh_600000) or index components (SZ1000)?

## Semantic Locks (Fatal)

| ID | Rule | On Violation |
|---|---|---|
| `SL-01` | Execute sell orders before buy orders in every trading cycle | halt |
| `SL-02` | Trading signals MUST use next-bar execution (no look-ahead) | halt |
| `SL-03` | Entity IDs MUST follow format entity_type_exchange_code | halt |
| `SL-04` | DataFrame index MUST be MultiIndex (entity_id, timestamp) | halt |
| `SL-05` | TradingSignal MUST have EXACTLY ONE of: position_pct, order_money, order_amount | halt |
| `SL-06` | filter_result column semantics: True=BUY, False=SELL, None/NaN=NO ACTION | halt |
| `SL-07` | Transformer MUST run BEFORE Accumulator in factor pipeline | halt |
| `SL-08` | MACD parameters locked: fast=12, slow=26, signal=9 | halt |

## Top Anti-Patterns (15 total)

- **`AP-REGTECH-001`**: Missing attribute initialization on data structures
- **`AP-REGTECH-002`**: Self-loops in transaction graphs violate domain rules
- **`AP-REGTECH-003`**: Unvalidated floating-point inputs cause runtime crashes
