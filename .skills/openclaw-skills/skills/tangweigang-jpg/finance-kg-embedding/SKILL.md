# finance-kg-embedding

> I help you build quant strategies on A-share with ZVT — from data fetch to backtest, one flow. Just tell me what you want; I'll write the code, you don't have to dig docs. (Heads up: ZVT natively supports A-share, HK, and crypto. US stocks — stockus_nasdaq_AAPL — are half-baked; don't bother for serious work.)

## Pipeline

`data_collection -> data_storage -> factor_computation -> target_selection -> trading_execution -> visualization`

## Top Use Cases (5 total)

### KGTransformer Model Training Pipeline (`UC-101`)
Training a knowledge graph-based transformer model for temporal/dynamic knowledge graph embedding tasks to learn entity and relation representations o
**Triggers**: training, knowledge graph, KGTransformer

### Dynamic Knowledge Graph Model Training (`UC-102`)
Training dynamic knowledge graph models to learn temporal entity and relation embeddings for link prediction and event time prediction tasks
**Triggers**: knowledge graph, dynamic graph, temporal modeling

### Early Stopping Training Utility (`UC-103`)
Preventing overfitting during model training by automatically stopping training when validation performance stops improving, with checkpoint managemen
**Triggers**: early stopping, overfitting prevention, model training

For all **5** use cases, see [references/USE_CASES.md](references/USE_CASES.md).

## Install

```bash
# One-time setup before first use
bash scripts/install.sh
```

**Execute trigger**: `When user intent matches intent_router.uc_entries[].positive_terms AND user uses action verb (run/execute/跑/执行/backtest/fetch/collect)`

## What I'll Ask You

- Target market: A-share (default), HK, or crypto? (US stocks in ZVT are half-baked — stockus_nasdaq_AAPL exists but coverage is thin)
- Data source / provider: eastmoney (free, no account), joinquant (account+paid), baostock (free, good history), akshare, or qmt (broker)?
- Strategy type: MACD golden-cross, MA crossover, volume breakout, fundamental screen, or custom factor?
- Time range: start_timestamp and end_timestamp for backtest period
- Target entity IDs: specific stocks (stock_sh_600000) or index components (SZ1000)?

## Semantic Locks (Fatal)

| ID | Rule | On Violation |
|---|---|---|
| `SL-01` | Execute sell orders before buy orders in every trading cycle | halt |
| `SL-02` | Trading signals MUST use next-bar execution (no look-ahead) | halt |
| `SL-03` | Entity IDs MUST follow format entity_type_exchange_code | halt |
| `SL-04` | DataFrame index MUST be MultiIndex (entity_id, timestamp) | halt |
| `SL-05` | TradingSignal MUST have EXACTLY ONE of: position_pct, order_money, order_amount | halt |
| `SL-06` | filter_result column semantics: True=BUY, False=SELL, None/NaN=NO ACTION | halt |
| `SL-07` | Transformer MUST run BEFORE Accumulator in factor pipeline | halt |
| `SL-08` | MACD parameters locked: fast=12, slow=26, signal=9 | halt |
