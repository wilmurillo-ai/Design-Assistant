# meitu-skills

Agent skill library for Meitu OpenAPI — enables AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, etc.) to generate posters, stickers, videos, and product images through purpose-built, scene-specific workflows.

## Security

**Important:** This skill requires API credentials. The runner does not auto-upgrade the CLI; runtime repair is manual.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for:
- Credential handling details
- Permission requirements
- Manual runtime repair guidance
- Security audit checklist

## Layout

- Root entry skill: `SKILL.md` (global routing guidance)
- Tool aggregate skill: `meitu-tools/`
- Primary scene skills: `skills/` (notably `meitu-poster`, `meitu-stickers`, `meitu-visual-me`, `meitu-product-swap`, `meitu-video-dance`)

## Quick Start

1. Install all skills

Preferred (ClawHub):

```bash
npm install -g clawhub
clawhub install meitu-skills
```

Fallback (GitHub URL):

```bash
npx -y skills add https://github.com/meitu/meitu-skills --yes
```

2. Install runtime CLI

```bash
npm install -g meitu-cli@latest
```

3. Configure credentials

- `MEITU_OPENAPI_ACCESS_KEY` + `MEITU_OPENAPI_SECRET_KEY` (env), or
- `~/.meitu/credentials.json` (via `meitu config set-ak` / `meitu config set-sk`)

4. Smoke test

```bash
node meitu-tools/scripts/run_command.js \
  --command image-upscale \
  --input-json '{"image":"https://obs.mtlab.meitu.com/public/resources/aigensource.png"}'
```

5. Runtime repair / manual upgrade

- `run_command.js` does not check npm or auto-install `meitu-cli`
- If runtime is missing/outdated, follow the manual repair commands below
- Long `action_url` values are preserved as-is; chat UIs may visually truncate them, but clicking still uses the full URL

Manual repair / upgrade:

```bash
npm install -g meitu-cli@latest
meitu --version
```

6. Sensitive data self-check (before commit/push/package)

```bash
rg -n --hidden -S \
  -g '!.git' -g '!node_modules' \
  '(MEITU_OPENAPI_ACCESS_KEY|MEITU_OPENAPI_SECRET_KEY|accessKey|secretKey|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}|BEGIN (RSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY)' .
```

- Run this before `git commit`, `git push`, and any zip/tar delivery.
- No output means no obvious plaintext secret was found by this rule set.
