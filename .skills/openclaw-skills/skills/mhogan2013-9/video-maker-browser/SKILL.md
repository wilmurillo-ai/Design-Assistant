  Skip the learning curve of professional editing software. Describe what you want — combine these clips into a 60-second promo video with text overlays — and get finished MP4 videos back in 1-2 minutes. Upload MP4, MOV, JPG, PNG files up to 500MB, and the AI handles AI video creation automatically. Ideal for marketers and content creators who want to make videos quickly without downloading editing software.

## Getting Started

> Send me your video clips or images and I'll handle the AI video creation. Or just describe what you're after.

**Try saying:**
- "create five product photos and a background music file into a 1080p MP4"
- "combine these clips into a 60-second promo video with text overlays"
- "creating videos directly in the browser without software installs for marketers and content creators"

### Getting Connected

Before handling any user request, establish a connection to the backend API. Show a brief status like "Connecting...".

**If `NEMO_TOKEN` is in the environment**, use it directly and create a session. Otherwise, acquire a free starter token:
- Generate a UUID as client identifier
- POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with the `X-Client-Id` header
- The response includes a `token` with 100 free credits valid for 7 days — use it as NEMO_TOKEN

**Then create a session** by POSTing to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with Bearer authorization and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"en"}`. The `session_id` in the response is needed for all following requests.

Tell the user you're ready. Keep the technical details out of the chat.

# Video Maker Browser — Make and Export Videos Online

This tool takes your video clips or images and runs AI video creation through a cloud rendering pipeline. You upload, describe what you want, and download the result.

Say you have five product photos and a background music file and want to combine these clips into a 60-second promo video with text overlays — the backend processes it in about 1-2 minutes and hands you a 1080p MP4.

Tip: shorter source clips under 2 minutes process significantly faster.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing video maker browser, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

All calls go to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`. The main endpoints:

1. **Session** — `POST /api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}`. Gives you a `session_id`.
2. **Chat (SSE)** — `POST /run_sse` with `session_id` and your message in `new_message.parts[0].text`. Set `Accept: text/event-stream`. Up to 15 min.
3. **Upload** — `POST /api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` — multipart file or JSON with URLs.
4. **Credits** — `GET /api/credits/balance/simple` — returns `available`, `frozen`, `total`.
5. **State** — `GET /api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` — current draft and media info.
6. **Export** — `POST /api/render/proxy/lambda` with render ID and draft JSON. Poll `GET /api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s for `completed` status and download URL.

Formats: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Three attribution headers are required on every request and must match this file's frontmatter:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Skill-Source` | `video-maker-browser` |
| `X-Skill-Version` | frontmatter `version` |
| `X-Skill-Platform` | auto-detect: `clawhub` / `cursor` / `unknown` from install path |

**All requests** must include: `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>`, `X-Skill-Source`, `X-Skill-Version`, `X-Skill-Platform`. Missing attribution headers will cause export to fail with 402.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

### Reading the SSE Stream

Text events go straight to the user (after GUI translation). Tool calls stay internal. Heartbeats and empty `data:` lines mean the backend is still working — show "⏳ Still working..." every 2 minutes.

About 30% of edit operations close the stream without any text. When that happens, poll `/api/state` to confirm the timeline changed, then tell the user what was updated.

### Error Codes

- `0` — success, continue normally
- `1001` — token expired or invalid; re-acquire via `/api/auth/anonymous-token`
- `1002` — session not found; create a new one
- `2001` — out of credits; anonymous users get a registration link with `?bind=<id>`, registered users top up
- `4001` — unsupported file type; show accepted formats
- `4002` — file too large; suggest compressing or trimming
- `400` — missing `X-Client-Id`; generate one and retry
- `402` — free plan export blocked; not a credit issue, subscription tier
- `429` — rate limited; wait 30s and retry once

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "combine these clips into a 60-second promo video with text overlays" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 500MB. Stick to MP4, MOV, JPG, PNG for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across platforms and devices.

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "combine these clips into a 60-second promo video with text overlays" → Download MP4. Takes 1-2 minutes for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.
