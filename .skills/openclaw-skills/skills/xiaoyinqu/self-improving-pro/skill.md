# Self-Improving Pro

> Self-reflection + Auto-learning + **Cloud Memory Sync** + **Multi-Model Intelligence**. The most powerful self-improving agent skill.

**Fork of [self-improving](https://clawhub.ai/ivangdavila/self-improving) with cloud superpowers.**

## What's New in Pro?

| Feature | self-improving | Self-Improving Pro |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Self-reflection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto-learning | ✅ | ✅ |
| Self-criticism | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Cloud memory sync** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Multi-model reasoning** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Cross-session learning** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Cost optimization** | ❌ | ✅ |

## Why Pro?

The original self-improving is great, but:
- Memory is **local only** - lost when you switch machines
- Uses **single model** - can't leverage best model for each task
- No **cost tracking** - no idea what you're spending

**Self-Improving Pro solves all of this.**

## Features

### 1. Cloud Memory Sync
Your agent's learnings persist across:
- Different machines
- Different sessions
- Team members (shared learning)

```bash
# Learnings auto-sync to cloud
curl -X POST "https://api.heybossai.com/v1/memory/sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_HUB_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"namespace": "my-agent", "learnings": [...]}'
```

### 2. Multi-Model Reasoning
Use the best model for each reflection task:
- **Quick checks**: GPT-4o-mini ($0.0001/reflection)
- **Deep analysis**: Claude Sonnet ($0.003/reflection)
- **Critical decisions**: o1/o3 reasoning ($0.01/reflection)

### 3. Cost-Aware Self-Improvement
Track ROI of your agent's learning:
```
Today's learnings: 47
Mistakes caught: 12
Estimated time saved: 3.2 hours
Cost: $0.23
ROI: 139x
```

## Quick Start

```bash
export API_HUB_API_KEY="your-key"  # Get at skillboss.co

# Agent auto-reflects after each task
# Learnings sync to cloud
# Best model selected per task
```

## When to Use

Activate when:
- Building autonomous agents
- Want persistent cross-session memory
- Need cost-effective self-improvement
- Working in teams with shared learning

**Trigger phrases**: "self improve", "reflect", "learn from mistakes", "get better", "auto learn"

## Pricing

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Quick reflection | $0.0001/call |
| Deep analysis | $0.003/call |
| Memory sync | $0.0001/KB |
| **Free tier** | 1000 reflections/month |

## Setup

1. Get API key at [skillboss.co](https://skillboss.co) - **$5 free credit**
2. `export API_HUB_API_KEY="your-key"`
3. Install: `clawhub install self-improving-pro`
