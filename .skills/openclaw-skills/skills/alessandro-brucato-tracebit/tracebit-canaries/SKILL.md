  Use when the user wants to protect their workspace from credential theft, prompt injection, or data exfiltration — even if they don't mention "canaries" or "honeytokens" directly. Covers deploying Tracebit security canaries (fake AWS keys, SSH keys, cookies, passwords, and email traps), detecting when they're triggered, and autonomous incident response. Also use when investigating a suspected compromise, hardening an agent's environment, or setting up tripwires to catch unauthorized access to sensitive files.

# Tracebit Canaries Skill

End-to-end security canary coverage — from signup to autonomous incident response. You (the agent) perform setup steps yourself, with human confirmation at key decision points.

The Tracebit CLI runs a background daemon that auto-refreshes credentials — set and forget. When a canary fires, the heartbeat inbox check detects the alert email, then you notify the human, investigate, and report.

Tracebit Community Edition is free at https://community.tracebit.com

## Execution Principles

**You are the operator. The human is the owner.**

- **Confirm with the human** before: starting deployment, writing credentials to disk, and rotating/remediating after incidents.
- **Browser steps**: use the OpenClaw managed `browser` tool — verify availability first:
  ```bash
  openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw status
  ```
- **Ask the human for**: 2FA codes, unreadable CAPTCHAs, or missing tool configuration

## Definition of Done

**Not done until every item is checked:**

```
[ ] Step 1: Tracebit account created — dashboard confirmed via browser snapshot
[ ] Step 2: CLI installed — `tracebit --version` returns a version
[ ] Step 3: CLI authenticated — `tracebit auth status` shows valid credentials
[ ] Step 4: All 5 canary types deployed
[ ] Step 5: `tracebit show` confirms all 5 active
[ ] Step 6: Heartbeat alert check block added to HEARTBEAT.md
```

Canaries without alert detection (Step 6) provide no protection. Do not skip it.

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Sign Up

Use the `browser` tool — not any system-installed browser.

```
1. Get your email address from the configured email provider
2. Generate a strong random password (20+ chars, mixed case, digits, symbols) and write it to a temp file — never include it in conversation output:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import secrets, string; chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '!@#\$%^&*'; print(''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(24)))" > /tmp/tracebit-setup-creds && chmod 600 /tmp/tracebit-setup-creds
   ```
   Tell the human the file path so they can retrieve it later.
3. browser navigate https://community.tracebit.com
4. browser snapshot — inspect the page
5. If a cookie consent banner appears, dismiss it before proceeding
6. Click "Sign up with email" (NOT "Sign in with Google" — avoids OAuth loops)
7. Type email and password into the form using refs from the snapshot
8. Submit — redirected to "Confirm your account" page
9. Retrieve confirmation code from inbox using your email provider's skill/tool
10. Type the code and submit
11. browser snapshot — confirm Tracebit dashboard loaded
```

**Error cases:**
- **Email already registered**: skip to Step 3
- **CAPTCHA**: `browser screenshot`, read it yourself, type it in. Ask human only if unreadable.
- **Code not arriving**: check spam folder, wait 20s, click "Resend code"

### Step 2: Install the CLI

```bash
bash scripts/install-tracebit.sh
```

Verify: `tracebit --version`

**If the script aborts with "no checksums file in release"** — this is normal, Tracebit doesn't publish SHA256SUMS. Rerun with:
```bash
SKIP_CHECKSUM=1 bash scripts/install-tracebit.sh
```

If it fails for any other reason, see `references/troubleshooting.md`.

### Step 3: Authenticate the CLI

`tracebit auth` starts a listener on `localhost:5442` and waits for an OAuth callback.

```bash
tracebit auth > /tmp/tracebit-auth.log 2>&1 &
TRACEBIT_PID=$!
sleep 3
cat /tmp/tracebit-auth.log
```

Then:
1. `browser navigate https://community.tracebit.com/cli-login`
2. `browser snapshot` — find the "Authorise" button
3. Click **Authorise** using the ref from the snapshot
4. Callback completes automatically — log shows `Successfully logged into Tracebit`

Verify: `tracebit auth status`

**Fallback** (if OAuth callback fails): `browser navigate https://community.tracebit.com` → Settings → API Keys → Create token → `tracebit auth --token`

### Step 4: Deploy All Canaries

```bash
tracebit deploy all      # ⚠️ will exit with an error on the username-password prompt — this is expected
tracebit deploy email    # email canary is NOT included in deploy all
```

The username-password credential is issued before the prompt fires. The error exit is a known CLI quirk. Just continue — `tracebit show` will confirm it's there.

Deploys 5 types: **aws**, **ssh**, **cookie**, **username-password**, **email**. See `references/canary-types.md` for details on each.

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

```bash
tracebit show
bash scripts/check-canaries.sh
```

All 5 types must appear active.

### Step 6: Configure Heartbeat Alert Detection

> **Not optional.** Without this, canaries fire silently.

Append to `HEARTBEAT.md` (create if needed):

```markdown
## Tracebit Canary Alert Check (every heartbeat, ~30 min)

Check for new Tracebit canary alert emails since the last heartbeat.
Using your email provider's skill/tool, search for emails from `notifications@community.tracebit.com` with subject containing "Tracebit Canary Triggered" from the last hour.

If any alert emails are found:
1. **Immediately notify the human via their configured messaging channel** — read `references/incident-response-playbook.md`
2. **Investigate** — follow the playbook phases
3. **Send a follow-up report** within 5 minutes
```

Also add this weekly check:

```markdown
## Tracebit Canary Health (weekly)
- Run: tracebit show
- If expired or missing: tracebit deploy all && tracebit deploy email
```

Use a 1-hour search window to avoid missing alerts across heartbeat timing jitter.

## Completion Report

Include verbatim when reporting to the human:

```
## Tracebit Canary Setup — Completion Report

[ ] Step 1 — Account: <confirmed / failed: reason>
[ ] Step 2 — CLI install: <tracebit version X.Y.Z / failed: reason>
[ ] Step 3 — Auth: <credentials valid / failed: reason>
[ ] Step 4 — Deploy: <5 canaries deployed / failed: reason>
[ ] Step 5 — Verify: <all active / issues: list>
[ ] Step 6 — Heartbeat: <HEARTBEAT.md updated / failed: reason>

Overall: COMPLETE ✅  /  INCOMPLETE ❌ (blocked on: <step>)

## Credentials
Tracebit account: <email address>
Tracebit password: saved to /tmp/tracebit-setup-creds (chmod 600)
⚠️ Store the password in your password manager, then delete the temp file.
⚠️ Change this password in Tracebit account settings.
```

**Password handling:** After generating the password, write it to a temp file — never include it in conversation output:
```bash
echo "<generated-password>" > /tmp/tracebit-setup-creds && chmod 600 /tmp/tracebit-setup-creds
```
Tell the human the file path and instruct them to save the password to their password manager, then delete the file.

## When a Canary Fires

Read and follow `references/incident-response-playbook.md` immediately. The playbook covers:
1. **Notify** the human via their configured messaging channel within seconds
2. **Investigate** autonomously (read-only)
3. **Report** findings within 5 minutes
4. **Rotate** canaries **after human acknowledgement**: `tracebit deploy all && tracebit deploy email`

## Removal

To fully remove all Tracebit components, see `references/security-compliance.md` — includes a cleanup script and manual removal steps.

---

## Gotchas

- `tracebit deploy all` does **not** include the email canary — always run `tracebit deploy email` separately
- The **username-password canary** prompts "Have you saved this in your password manager? [y/n]" which fails non-interactively. The credential is issued before the prompt — check `tracebit show`. If missing: `tracebit deploy username-password --json-output`
- **Email canary tracking pixel**: opening/previewing the canary email fires the alert. This is by design — the email is the bait.
- **Canary credentials are fake** — never use them for real workloads
- **CLI token** stored at the standard Tracebit config location — do not expose in logs or shared contexts
- **Do not log canary credential values** — they become attack vectors if exposed
