# Changelog

## v0.6.7 - 2026-04-09

- added a localized HTML reading layer so every generated workspace now includes `阅读版/00-先看这里.html` or `reading/00-start-here.html` for direct viewing after download
- kept markdown as the editable workspace source while preserving numbered DOCX files for formal deliverables
- updated validation, README, SKILL, release collateral, and sample outputs so the public contract matches the new three-layer output model

## v0.6.6 - 2026-04-09

- disabled automatic host-package installation in the marketplace-facing Python compatibility helper so `scripts/ensure_python_runtime.py` now stays in compatibility-guidance mode unless it is only rerunning a target script with an already-trusted interpreter
- tightened persisted output boundaries by constraining generated artifact output and persisted role briefs to stay inside the approved company workspace
- disabled implicit invocation in `agents/openai.yaml` and rewrote README, SKILL, security docs, listing copy, publishing notes, and release collateral so the public safety boundary matches the real runtime behavior

## v0.6.5 - 2026-04-07

- localized the entire founder-visible workspace surface so Chinese founders now get Chinese file and directory names while English founders get English-visible equivalents
- moved machine state to the hidden internal path `.opcos/state/current-state.json` and removed the old visible state-file leak from founder workspaces
- added path-layout helpers, migration-safe workspace harmonization, localized artifact names, and stricter release validation for Chinese and English workspace separation

## v0.6.4 - 2026-04-07

- removed the hard-coded leaked vertical case from generated founder-facing surfaces such as landing copy, interview board, trial intake, feedback capture, and demo HTML
- enforced a direction-first bootstrap contract in `scripts/init_company.py` so workspace creation now requires confirmed founder inputs instead of placeholder defaults
- updated validation, README, release collateral, prompt metadata, and first-run docs so the public surface matches the real runtime behavior

## v0.6.3 - 2026-04-04

- removed leftover state lock artifacts from founder workspaces so merge-safe persistence no longer leaves `当前状态.json.lock` behind after script runs
- kept the merged-save and file-lock protection from `v0.6.2` while cleaning the user-visible workspace surface back to final deliverables only

## v0.6.2 - 2026-04-04

- added founder-facing growth assets to the workspace renderer: `sales/04-对外落地页文案.md`, `sales/05-访谈冲刺看板.md`, `sales/06-试用申请问卷.md`, `delivery/04-试用反馈回收表.md`, and `product/demo/index.html`
- upgraded `00-经营总盘.md` and `04-产品与上线状态.md` so they link directly to demo, landing, intake, and feedback surfaces instead of stopping at abstract status summaries
- turned the generated demo into a real static HTML page with pricing, product boundary, trial path, and a visible intake form block
- hardened state persistence in `scripts/common.py` with baseline-aware merge saves plus file locking so parallel script runs no longer clobber unrelated state sections
- revalidated the package with `python3 scripts/validate_release.py`, `git diff --check`, and a concurrent founder-run regression on a temporary workspace

## v0.6.1 - 2026-04-04

- fixed stage inference so updating cash no longer incorrectly promotes a build-stage company into operate or grow
- stopped `update_cash.py` from forcibly overwriting the founder's primary arena
- upgraded generated support work surfaces so `product/01-MVP与上线清单.md`, `sales/01-成交动作清单.md`, and `ops/01-上线检查清单.md` are now actionable checklists instead of duplicated root docs
- tightened release validation to generate and verify deployment and production DOCX artifacts explicitly instead of relying on stage side effects
- validated the improved workflow against a realistic narrow-founder scenario without binding the package to any leaked or hard-coded vertical case

## v0.6.0 - 2026-04-04

- rebuilt the product around a business-loop state model instead of a stage/round-first surface
- added v3 state handling with shared objects for founder, focus, offer, pipeline, product, delivery, cash, assets, and risk while keeping legacy compatibility fields
- changed the generated workspace to a new operating dashboard surface with direct files for offer, pipeline, product, delivery, cash, assets, risks, weekly focus, and daily action
- added business-first scripts for focus, offer, pipeline, product, delivery, cash, asset, migration, and system validation
- kept legacy round and stage scripts runnable by mapping them onto the new state model
- updated validation, README, release docs, skill metadata, and agent metadata to present the project as a true one-person-company operating system instead of a round-driven document system

## v0.5.8 - 2026-04-04

- removed status markers such as `[待生成]` and `[已生成]` from generated DOCX file names so artifacts now use their final deliverable names from the start
- replaced `07-文档产物规范.md` and `11-交付状态总览.md` with `07-交付物地图.md` and `11-交付目录总览.md` to make the workspace read like real output instead of output specification
- dropped the workspace-level deliverable-template directory and shifted the generated artifact pack toward actual formal documents
- upgraded artifact templates, workspace rendering, stage transition logic, and release validation to track document maturity inside content rather than in file names
- refreshed README, guides, release collateral, and publishing notes so the project surface matches the new final-document model end to end

## v0.5.7 - 2026-04-04

- repositioned the visible workflow around an AI-era fast loop: validate demand, ship the smallest useful MVP, launch narrowly, capture feedback, improve, then scale
- kept the internal stage engine but reframed stages as lightweight bottleneck labels instead of heavyweight process phases
- added `12-AI时代快循环.md` to generated workspaces so founders can read the operating model directly on disk
- updated founder start guidance, stage/output templates, release copy, and agent metadata to match the new fast-loop positioning
- expanded release validation to check the new fast-loop guide in generated workspaces

## v0.5.6 - 2026-04-04

- upgraded the first-run contract so the system now actively asks for a one-line founder idea or offers 3 to 4 startup directions instead of front-loading heavy input
- added `10-创始人启动卡.md` and `11-交付状态总览.md` so founders can immediately see how to start and which formal deliverables are still pending vs completed
- changed starter artifact generation from plain fixed DOCX files to status-marked placeholder files such as `[待生成]` and automatic promotion to `[已生成]`
- added review-path and improvement reminders to every runtime report so users always know where to inspect the latest output and how to request changes
- tightened validation to check the new placeholder naming, status overview, removal of legacy unnumbered artifact folders, and placeholder-to-completed promotion flow

## v0.5.5 - 2026-04-03

- upgraded the ClawHub storefront summary from descriptive to outcome-driven so the first line feels more compelling to new users
- aligned the listing short description with the new stronger hook

- upgraded `scripts/validate_release.py` to verify the English runtime and document-generation path in addition to the existing Chinese path
- updated README, guides, ClawHub listing copy, release collateral, and publishing notes to present the project as bilingual rather than Chinese-only

## v0.5.0 - 2026-04-03
