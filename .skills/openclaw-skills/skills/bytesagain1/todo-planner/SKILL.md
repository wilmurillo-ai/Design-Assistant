# Todo Planner

Todo Planner v2.0.0 — a productivity toolkit for managing tasks, plans, and reviews from the command line. All data is stored locally in flat log files with timestamps, making it easy to review history, export records, and search across entries.

## Commands

Run `scripts/script.sh <command> [args]` to use.

### Core Operations

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add <input>` | Log an add entry (e.g. add a new task, note, or action item) |
| `plan <input>` | Log a plan entry (e.g. create a daily/weekly plan, set goals) |
| `track <input>` | Log a track entry (e.g. track progress on a task or project) |
| `review <input>` | Log a review entry (e.g. review completed tasks, reflect on progress) |
| `streak <input>` | Log a streak entry (e.g. record daily streaks, habit tracking) |
| `remind <input>` | Log a remind entry (e.g. set reminders, note follow-ups) |
| `prioritize <input>` | Log a prioritize entry (e.g. rank tasks, flag urgent items) |
| `archive <input>` | Log an archive entry (e.g. archive completed tasks, move to done) |
| `tag <input>` | Log a tag entry (e.g. tag tasks with categories or labels) |
| `timeline <input>` | Log a timeline entry (e.g. plot tasks on a timeline, milestones) |
| `report <input>` | Log a report entry (e.g. daily/weekly task summaries) |
| `weekly-review <input>` | Log a weekly-review entry (e.g. end-of-week retrospectives) |

Each command without arguments shows the 20 most recent entries for that category.

### Utility Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `stats` | Summary statistics across all log categories with entry counts and disk usage |
| `export <fmt>` | Export all data in `json`, `csv`, or `txt` format |
| `search <term>` | Search across all log files for a keyword (case-insensitive) |
| `recent` | Show the 20 most recent entries from the global activity history |
| `status` | Health check — version, data directory, total entries, disk usage, last activity |
| `help` | Show full usage information |
| `version` | Show version string (`todo-planner v2.0.0`) |

## Data Storage

All data is persisted locally under `~/.local/share/todo-planner/`:

- **`<command>.log`** — One log file per command (e.g. `add.log`, `plan.log`, `track.log`)
- **`history.log`** — Global activity log with timestamps for every operation
- **`export.<fmt>`** — Generated export files (json/csv/txt)

Each entry is stored as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|<input>` (pipe-delimited). No external services, no API keys, no network calls — everything stays on your machine.

## Requirements

- **Bash** 4.0+ with `set -euo pipefail`
- Standard Unix utilities: `date`, `wc`, `du`, `grep`, `tail`, `cat`, `sed`, `basename`
- No external dependencies or packages required
- No API keys or accounts needed

## When to Use

1. **Capturing tasks quickly** — Use `add` to log new tasks as they come to mind, building a searchable backlog you can organize later with `prioritize` and `tag`
2. **Planning your day or week** — Use `plan` to create structured daily agendas, then `track` progress throughout the day as you complete items
3. **Maintaining streaks and habits** — Use `streak` to record daily consistency, then `search` to review your habit patterns over time
4. **Running weekly retrospectives** — Use `weekly-review` to log end-of-week reflections, then `report` to generate summaries of what was accomplished
5. **Archiving and organizing** — Use `archive` to move completed work out of active view, `tag` to categorize tasks, and `timeline` to visualize milestones

## Examples

```bash
# Add a new task
todo-planner add "Write blog post about productivity systems — due Friday"

# Plan your day
todo-planner plan "Morning: code review, API docs. Afternoon: deploy staging, team sync"

# Track progress on a task
todo-planner track "Blog post: draft complete, needs editing pass"

# Prioritize urgent items
todo-planner prioritize "P1: Deploy hotfix. P2: Update docs. P3: Refactor tests"

# Tag a task with a category
todo-planner tag "blog-post: writing, content, marketing"

# Run a weekly review
todo-planner weekly-review "Completed 12/15 tasks. Carried over: API docs, test refactor, deploy script"

# Search for all entries mentioning 'deploy'
todo-planner search deploy

# Export everything to CSV
todo-planner export csv

# View summary statistics
todo-planner stats
```
