  Get polished MP4 files ready to post, without touching a single slider. Upload your video clips (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM, up to 500MB), say something like "trim the footage, add background music, and export as MP4", and download 1080p MP4 when it's done. Built for students who move fast and want to edit videos locally without subscriptions or cloud uploads.

## Getting Started

> Ready when you are. Drop your video clips here or describe what you want to make.

**Try saying:**
- "create a 2-minute raw phone recording into a 1080p MP4"
- "trim the footage, add background music, and export as MP4"
- "editing and exporting videos without an internet connection for students"

### First-Time Connection

When a user first opens this skill, connect to the processing backend automatically. Briefly let them know (e.g. "Setting up...").

**Authentication**: Check if `NEMO_TOKEN` is set in the environment. If it is, skip to step 2.

1. **Obtain a free token**: Generate a random UUID as client identifier. POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with header `X-Client-Id` set to that UUID. The response `data.token` is your NEMO_TOKEN — 100 free credits, valid 7 days.
2. **Create a session**: POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Content-Type: application/json`, and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"<detected>"}`. Store the returned `session_id` for all subsequent requests.

Keep setup communication brief. Don't display raw API responses or token values to the user.

# Video Maker Free Offline — Create and Export Videos Locally

Send me your video clips and describe the result you want. The offline video creation runs on remote GPU nodes — nothing to install on your machine.

A quick example: upload a 2-minute raw phone recording, type "trim the footage, add background music, and export as MP4", and you'll get a 1080p MP4 back in roughly 1-2 minutes. All rendering happens server-side.

Worth noting: shorter clips under 3 minutes process significantly faster offline.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing video maker free offline, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

All calls go to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`. The main endpoints:

1. **Session** — `POST /api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}`. Gives you a `session_id`.
2. **Chat (SSE)** — `POST /run_sse` with `session_id` and your message in `new_message.parts[0].text`. Set `Accept: text/event-stream`. Up to 15 min.
3. **Upload** — `POST /api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` — multipart file or JSON with URLs.
4. **Credits** — `GET /api/credits/balance/simple` — returns `available`, `frozen`, `total`.
5. **State** — `GET /api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` — current draft and media info.
6. **Export** — `POST /api/render/proxy/lambda` with render ID and draft JSON. Poll `GET /api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s for `completed` status and download URL.

Formats: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Skill attribution — read from this file's YAML frontmatter at runtime:
- `X-Skill-Source`: `video-maker-free-offline`
- `X-Skill-Version`: from frontmatter `version`
- `X-Skill-Platform`: detect from install path (`~/.clawhub/` → `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` → `cursor`, else `unknown`)

Every API call needs `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>` plus the three attribution headers above. If any header is missing, exports return 402.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

### SSE Event Handling

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text response | Apply GUI translation (§4), present to user |
| Tool call/result | Process internally, don't forward |
| `heartbeat` / empty `data:` | Keep waiting. Every 2 min: "⏳ Still working..." |
| Stream closes | Process final response |

~30% of editing operations return no text in the SSE stream. When this happens: poll session state to verify the edit was applied, then summarize changes to the user.

### Error Codes

- `0` — success, continue normally
- `1001` — token expired or invalid; re-acquire via `/api/auth/anonymous-token`
- `1002` — session not found; create a new one
- `2001` — out of credits; anonymous users get a registration link with `?bind=<id>`, registered users top up
- `4001` — unsupported file type; show accepted formats
- `4002` — file too large; suggest compressing or trimming
- `400` — missing `X-Client-Id`; generate one and retry
- `402` — free plan export blocked; not a credit issue, subscription tier
- `429` — rate limited; wait 30s and retry once

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "trim the footage, add background music, and export as MP4" → Download MP4. Takes 1-2 minutes for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "trim the footage, add background music, and export as MP4" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 500MB. Stick to MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across devices and platforms.
