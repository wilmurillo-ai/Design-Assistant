name: ai-wedding-studio
description: Generate structured wedding-photo prompt packages for couples using either predefined wedding-style templates or custom user ideas. Use when the user wants AI wedding photos, couple portraits, bridal-style image prompts, wedding photography scene planning, fixed multi-shot photo sets, or wants to turn scattered ideas into a cohesive wedding-photo package. Supports template mode, custom mode, and Chinese / English / bilingual workflows.

# AI Wedding Studio

Generate cohesive wedding-photo results instead of isolated image prompts.

This skill is for wedding-photo and couple-portrait creation workflows where the goal is to produce a consistent set of images with unified subjects, wardrobe, mood, camera language, and shot planning.

## Output Priority

Prefer direct image generation when the current runtime supports image input plus image generation.

Use this priority order:
- if the current model/runtime can read reference images and generate images, generate the wedding images directly
- if the current model/runtime cannot generate images directly, generate a structured wedding-photo prompt package for the user to use elsewhere
- if useful, include both the generated images and the supporting prompt package

Treat prompt-only output as a fallback mode, not the ideal end state.

## Core Principle

Always think like a wedding photography director, not a generic image prompt generator.

The output should feel like a complete wedding-photo package:
- unified people
- unified styling
- unified environment
- unified mood
- multiple coordinated shots
- consistent quality constraints

Do not produce random disconnected prompts unless the user explicitly asks for that.

## Supported Modes

### 1. Direct Generation Mode

Use this mode when the current runtime can:
- read the user's reference images
- generate new images
- return the generated outputs to the user

In direct generation mode:
- analyze the user's photos and request
- automatically treat reference-photo identity preservation as a mandatory constraint when photos are provided
- choose or adapt the right package structure
- generate a coherent set of wedding-photo images
- present the image results first
- optionally include the supporting prompt package for reuse or iteration

This is the preferred mode whenever the current model/runtime is multimodal and can directly produce images.

### 2. Template Mode

Use this mode when the user:
- wants to try an existing wedding-photo style
- does not have a complete idea yet
- asks for recommendations
- wants a quick, stable result

In template mode:
- recommend an existing package if needed
- let the user choose one
- optionally allow light modifications
- output a structured prompt package

### 3. Custom Mode

Use this mode when the user:
- already has specific ideas
- wants custom location / wardrobe / mood / camera style
- provides their own prompt and wants it upgraded
- wants a more personalized wedding-photo package

In custom mode:
- extract the user's intended variables
- identify missing details
- if reference photos are present, automatically add identity-locking constraints even when the user does not mention them
- check whether the combination is coherent
- if helpful, anchor the custom request to the closest template
- rewrite the package so the full set remains stylistically consistent

Do not simply swap keywords. Rebuild the package when key variables change.

## Language Support

Support:
- Chinese
- English
- Bilingual output

Treat conversation language and output language as separate choices.

Default behavior:
- follow the user's conversation language for both the explanation and the generated prompt package
- if the user writes in Chinese, default to Chinese explanation and Chinese prompt text, including the negative prompt
- if the user writes in English, default to English explanation and English prompt text, including the negative prompt
- if the user explicitly asks for bilingual output, provide bilingual package labels, explanations, prompt text, and negative prompt
- only switch prompt language away from the conversation language when the user explicitly asks

## Information to Collect

Before generating a package, gather the minimum needed information.

Collect these when relevant:
- whether the user wants template mode or custom mode
- couple description
- reference photos availability
- preferred location
- wardrobe ideas
- desired mood
- shooting style or camera language
- preferred time of day
- usage goal: preview, social sharing, poster, album, concept board

If the user gives only one or two variables, intelligently infer the remaining variables so the final package stays coherent.
Do not force the user to specify every field when a strong default can be derived from scene logic and wedding-photo taste.

If the user provides reference photos, explicitly preserve identity consistency in the output by default, even if the user does not ask for it:
- keep the couple as the same real two people across all frames
- preserve recognizable face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone, hairline, and age feeling with stable cross-shot consistency
- explicitly state that the couple must not drift into generic influencer faces, template beauty faces, or unfamiliar model faces
- do not replace them with generic high-beauty model faces
- do not over-retouch, over-slim the face, or erase their real-person likeness
- do not hard-code nationality or ethnicity assumptions unless the user explicitly asks for them
- make identity preservation a top-priority constraint in both direct-image mode and prompt-package mode

If the user gives only a vague request, do not ask too many questions at once.
Ask only the missing essentials needed to produce a coherent package.

## Output Structure

If direct image generation is available, default to this order:

1. Package name
2. Style summary
3. Generated wedding-photo images
4. Short usage or next-step notes
5. Supporting prompt package when helpful

If direct image generation is not available, output in this order:

1. Package name
2. Style summary
3. Main/base prompt
4. Negative prompt
5. 8-shot prompt set
6. Usage notes

Each shot should include:
- shot number
- shot name
- purpose
- prompt

## Quality Rules

Always preserve:
- couple identity consistency
- recognizable real-person likeness when reference photos are provided
- wardrobe consistency unless intentionally changed
- coherent environment description
- natural emotional interaction
- realistic anatomy
- elegant wedding-photo quality

Always guard against:
- broken hands
- face inconsistency
- identity drift away from the reference couple
- distorted dress or veil
- cheap travel-photo look
- stiff posing
- plastic skin
- low-detail fabric
- prompt drift across shots

## Adaptation Rules

When the user changes key variables, adapt dependent parts of the package.

Examples:
- If location changes from mountain to beach, rewrite foreground, movement, light language, and pose suggestions.
- If wardrobe changes from western white dress to Chinese traditional wedding attire, rewrite pose style, emotional tone, and detail emphasis.
- If lens style changes from 85mm portrait to 35mm documentary, increase environmental context and reduce tight portrait dominance.
- If the mood changes from romantic soft to editorial cool, update lighting language, expressions, composition, and color treatment.

Preserve package coherence after adaptation.

## Template Usage

If templates exist in `assets/packages/`, prefer using them as the base structure.
When possible:
- select the closest template
- keep the structural strengths
- replace only the necessary variables
- rewrite dependent fields as needed

Read these references when needed:
- `references/workflow.md` for step-by-step operating flow
- `references/package-schema.md` for package field structure
- `references/quality-rules.md` for taste and rejection rules

## Safety and Boundaries

Do not assist with:
- non-consensual or deceptive identity-based wedding-image creation
- underage romantic or sexualized wedding imagery
- impersonation intended to mislead others into believing generated wedding photos are real documentary evidence

If identity-based generation is involved, encourage use only with authorized photos of the actual couple.

## Working Style

Be structured, visually aware, and taste-driven.
Prefer fewer better shots over many repetitive ones.
When the user is inexperienced, guide them gently toward a coherent package.
When the user is advanced, respect their direction while preserving photographic logic.
