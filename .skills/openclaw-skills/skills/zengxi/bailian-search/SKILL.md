# Bailian Search

Real-time web search powered by Alibaba Cloud Bailian (DashScope) MCP service.

## Overview

This skill integrates with Alibaba Cloud Bailian's Web Search MCP (Model Context Protocol) service, enabling AI assistants to retrieve real-time information from the internet, improving response accuracy and timeliness.

## Features

- 🔍 Real-time web search
- 🌐 Global information coverage
- ⚡ Fast response via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- 🔒 Secure API key management
- 🛠️ Easy integration with OpenClaw

## Prerequisites

1. **Alibaba Cloud Account**: Register at [Alibaba Cloud Bailian](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com)
2. **API Key**: Obtain a DashScope API Key from the console

## Installation

### Using ClawHub (Recommended)

```bash
openclaw skill install bailian-search
# or
clawhub install bailian-search
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone to OpenClaw workspace
git clone <repository-url> ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/bailian-search

# Or download and extract to:
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/bailian-search/
```

## Configuration

### Set Environment Variable

**Option 1: Temporary (current session)**
```bash
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your-dashscope-api-key"
```

**Option 2: Permanent (recommended)**

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
echo 'export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your-dashscope-api-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Option 3: OpenClaw Config**
```bash
openclaw config set env.DASHSCOPE_API_KEY "your-dashscope-api-key"
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# After setting environment variable
./search.sh "latest tech news"

# Or one-liner
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your-key" ./search.sh "OpenAI GPT-5 release"
```

### Via AI Assistant

Once configured, simply ask your AI assistant:
- "Search for today's tech news"
- "Find OpenAI's latest announcements"
- "Look up 2025 China EV sales data"

The AI will automatically use this skill to fetch real-time information.

## How It Works

This skill connects to Alibaba Cloud Bailian's **MCP SSE (Server-Sent Events)** service:

1. Receives user search query
2. Establishes SSE connection to Bailian MCP server
3. Retrieves real-time search results
4. Returns structured content to the AI

## MCP Configuration (Advanced)

For use with other MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebSearch": {
      "type": "sse",
      "name": "Alibaba Cloud Bailian Web Search",
      "description": "Real-time web search powered by Tongyi Lab's Text-Embedding, GTE-reRank, Query Rewriting, and Search Judgment models.",
      "baseUrl": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api/v1/mcps/WebSearch/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${DASHSCOPE_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
