# Whale Pulse Monitor

Stop guessing. Start tracking the money. This skill provides direct access to the Sovereign-Futures OBI scanning engine, alerting you when a physical imbalance is detected on OKX/Binance.

## Features
- **Whale Fingerprinting**: Distinguishes between retail noise and institutional iceberg orders.
- **S-Level Alerts**: Triggers only when OBI > 5.0 for maximum conviction.
- **Low Latency**: Directly interfaced with the Rust-based market-cli.

## Usage
```bash
npx openclaw skill run whale-pulse-monitor
```

## Why it costs $0.25?
To filter out non-professional noise and maintain our high-performance infrastructure.
