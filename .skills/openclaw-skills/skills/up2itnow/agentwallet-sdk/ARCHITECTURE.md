# AgentNexus Architecture

## System Overview

AgentNexus is a hybrid decentralized application (dApp) that combines on-chain security with off-chain AI computation.

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Accounts (ERC-4337)

We use Account Abstraction to give every user and agent a smart wallet.

- **Contract**: `AgentNexusAccount.sol`
- **Features**: Keyless recovery (planned), batched transactions, sponsored gas.

### 2. Execution Engine

The backend orchestrates agent execution securely.

- **Isolation**: Agents run in Docker containers with no network access (except whitelisted APIs).
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and RAM are strictly capped.
- **Sanitization**: All inputs and outputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

### 3. The "Air Gap"

To protect user funds, there is a strict separation between the AI execution environment and the blockchain wallet.

- **Agents** cannot sign transactions.
- **Agents** cannot access private keys.
- **Agents** can only propose actions via the backend, which requires user approval (or pre-approved session keys).

### 4. Observability & Analytics

We provide real-time visibility into agent operations.

- **WebSocket Service**: Streams execution logs, status updates, and metrics to the frontend in real-time.
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks agent performance, usage stats, and user retention using PostHog and Prisma.

## Data Flow: Agent Execution

1.  **Purchase**: User buys access to an agent (on-chain transaction).
2.  **Request**: User sends input data to Backend.
3.  **Verification**: Backend checks on-chain entitlement.
4.  **Execution**: Backend spins up Docker container with agent code.
5.  **Output**: Agent processes data and returns result.
6.  **Settlement**: Backend updates usage stats; if micro-payment is needed, it's processed via the Smart Account.
