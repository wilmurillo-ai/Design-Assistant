# Google Stitch Workflow

Disciplined OpenClaw skill bundle for using Google Stitch through the verified MCP surface.

## At a glance

- MCP-first: separates verified MCP actions from browser-only Stitch features
- practical: optimized for project inspection, screen generation, controlled edits, and redesign iteration
- pragmatic for greenfield apps: when an accepted Stitch export is available, use it as the translation seed instead of rebuilding from screenshots
- cautious: emphasizes parameter discipline, visual review, and failure recovery

## Best for

- inspecting Stitch projects and screens before editing
- generating one screen at a time from a structured prompt
- refining generated screens with small preservation-oriented edits
- redesigning existing app screens from reliable references
- bootstrapping a new app UI from accepted Stitch-generated screens and exports
- deciding when to stay in Stitch and when to move to code

## Not for

- blind direct production UI implementation from raw exports
- pixel-perfect code-side fixes
- whole-product planning in one giant prompt
- blind reliance on browser-only Stitch features through MCP

## Quick start

1. Read [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).
2. Inspect the project and target screen before editing.
3. Generate one screen or make one small edit.
4. Review the visual result immediately.
5. Move to code only after one canonical screen direction is accepted.
