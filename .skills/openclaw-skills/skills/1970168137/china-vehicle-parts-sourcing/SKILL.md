# China Vehicle Parts Sourcing Skill

## Description
This skill helps international buyers navigate China's vehicle parts manufacturing landscape, which is projected to exceed **¥6.2 trillion in revenue by 2026**. It provides data-backed intelligence on regional clusters, supply chain structure, and industry trends based on the latest government policies and industry reports. Coverage includes traditional ICE components, NEV-specific parts (batteries, motors, electronic control), ADAS electronics, aftermarket parts, and specialized components for commercial vehicles (trucks, buses) and motorcycles.

## Key Capabilities
- **Industry Overview**: Get a summary of China's vehicle parts industry scale, development targets, and key policy initiatives.
- **Supply Chain Structure**: Understand the complete industry chain from raw materials and core components to downstream applications across all vehicle types.
- **Regional Clusters**: Identify specialized manufacturing hubs for different vehicle parts (powertrain, electrification, chassis, body, interior, electronics, aftermarket) for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and motorcycles.
- **Subsector Insights**: Access detailed information on key subsectors (powertrain, electrification components, chassis, body, interior, automotive electronics, aftermarket).
- **Sourcing Recommendations**: Get practical guidance on evaluating and selecting suppliers, including verification methods, communication best practices, typical lead times, and payment terms.

## How to Use
You can interact with this skill using natural language. For example:
- "What's the overall status of China's vehicle parts industry in 2026?"
- "Show me the supply chain structure for vehicle parts"
- "Which regions are best for sourcing EV batteries for trucks?"
- "Tell me about motorcycle engine manufacturing clusters"
- "How do I evaluate suppliers of commercial vehicle axles?"
- "What certifications should I look for in vehicle parts suppliers?"

## Data Sources
This skill aggregates data from:
- Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) official policies
- China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM)
- China Motorcycle Association
- National Bureau of Statistics of China
- Industry research publications (updated Q1 2026)

## Implementation
The skill logic is implemented in `do.py`, which reads structured data from `data.json`. All data is cluster-level intelligence without individual factory contacts.

## API Reference

The following Python functions are available in `do.py` for programmatic access:

### `get_industry_overview() -> Dict`
Returns overview of China's vehicle parts industry scale, targets, and key policy initiatives.

**Example:**
```python
from do import get_industry_overview
result = get_industry_overview()
# Returns: industry scale, 2026 targets, automation rates, key drivers, etc.
