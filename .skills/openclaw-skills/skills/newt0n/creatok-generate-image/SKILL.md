description: "This skill should be used when the user asks to generate an image, create an AI image, produce a product image, generate a visual from a prompt, or check and continue an existing image generation task. Generates images through CreatOK's image generation API and can also recover interrupted generation flows from an existing task id."

# generate-image

## Constraints

- The model's final user-facing response should match the user's input language, default **English**.
- Must request **user confirmation** before triggering any paid/high-cost image generation call.
- After confirmed, must call **CreatOK Open Skills proxy** and wait until completion.
- Avoid technical wording in the user-facing reply unless the user explicitly needs details for debugging.

## Model Selection Rules

- `Seedream 5.0 Lite`
  - actual model id: `seedream-5.0-lite`
  - faster and lighter, good for quick iteration
  - resolutions: **2K, 4K only**

- `Nano Banana Pro`
  - actual model id: `nano-banana-pro`
  - highest quality, best for photorealistic portraits and product shots
  - resolutions: **1K, 2K, 4K**

- `Nano Banana 2`
  - actual model id: `nano-banana-2`
  - latest Nano Banana, best overall quality
  - resolutions: **1K, 2K, 4K**

The model should recommend a model before generation based on the use case:

- **portraits / photorealistic people** → `nano-banana-2`
- **product shots / e-commerce** → `nano-banana-pro`
- **general illustration / concept art** → `nano-banana-2`
- **quick preview / iteration** → `seedream-5.0-lite`
- **user explicitly wants 1K** → `nano-banana-pro` or `nano-banana-2` (Seedream does not support 1K)

## Inputs to clarify (ask if missing)

- ask only for what is necessary to generate a good image
- if resolution or aspect ratio is not specified, use sensible defaults (2K, square)
- if the prompt is vague, offer to refine it before confirming generation
- reference images are optional — ask only if the user implies style transfer or subject reference
- when reference images are used, upload the local image file first and submit the returned uploaded reference with the generation task

## Workflow

1. **Confirmation gate** (mandatory)

- Summarize:
  - model
  - resolution
  - number of images (`n`)
  - aspect ratio if specified
  - estimated cost/credits if available
- Ask for a simple confirmation before submitting.
- Do **not** submit the generation task until user says yes.

2. Submit image generation

- Call CreatOK: `POST /api/open/skills/image-generation`

3. Poll status until completion

- Call CreatOK: `GET /api/open/skills/tasks/status?task_id=...&task_type=image_generation`

4. Persist artifacts + respond

- Write:
  - `outputs/result.json` with `task_id/status/images/raw`
  - `outputs/result.md`
- Persist the `task_id` immediately after submission so the user can recover later.
- Return the final image URLs verbatim.

## Existing Task Recovery

- If the user already has a `task_id`, continue from that task instead of starting a new one.
- In recovery mode, do not ask the user to restate the prompt if the task id is already available.
- The model can either check status once or keep polling if the user wants to wait.
- If the task succeeded, return the final image URLs verbatim.
- If the task is still queued or running, explain clearly and offer to keep checking.
- If the task failed, explain the failure and suggest next steps.

## Artifacts

All artifacts under `generate-image/.artifacts/<run_id>/...`.

## Thin Client Boundary

- This skill submits generation jobs, polls status, and persists fixed-format outputs.
- The model should not make the user restate their idea if the direction is already clear from the conversation.
