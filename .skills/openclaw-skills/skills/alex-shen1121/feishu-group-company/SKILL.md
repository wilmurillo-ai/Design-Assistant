description: "Configure a Feishu multi-bot company group so one coordinator bot, for example `company-ceo`, handles normal group messages, while specialist bots reply only when explicitly @mentioned. Use when setting up or fixing a shared company/work group with multiple Feishu bot accounts, especially for patterns like: normal messages then CEO replies; at UI then UI replies; at dev then dev replies; and CEO stays silent when another bot is explicitly mentioned."

# Feishu Group Company

## Overview

Use this skill to standardize a shared Feishu company group with one default coordinator bot and multiple specialist bots.

Target behavior:
- No @mention in the group → only the coordinator bot replies
- @mention a specialist bot → only that specialist replies
- When another bot is explicitly mentioned, the coordinator bot returns `NO_REPLY`

## Quick start

1. Confirm the group chat ID (`oc_xxx`) and the Feishu account IDs for all bots.
2. Decide which bot is the default coordinator, usually `company-ceo`.
3. Run `scripts/apply_feishu_group_company.py` against `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
4. Reload/restart Gateway if needed.
5. Verify with two tests:
   - plain message with no @mention
   - message that @mentions a specialist bot

## What this skill changes

For the target group:
- Top-level group rule becomes `requireMention: true`
- Specialist bot accounts get per-account override `groups.<chatId>.requireMention: true`
- Coordinator bot account gets per-account override `groups.<chatId>.requireMention: false`
- Coordinator bot gets a group-scoped `systemPrompt` that enforces:
  - no @mention → reply normally
  - @other user/bot but not coordinator → `NO_REPLY`
  - @coordinator → reply normally
- Legacy invalid per-account key `group` is removed in favor of `groups`

## Important notes

- Use `groups`, not `group`, under `channels.feishu.accounts.<accountId>`.
- If you rename a Feishu account ID, also update any `bindings[].match.accountId` that reference it.
- Specialist bots may still receive the event at transport level if they have group-message permissions; the important part is that they are mention-gated and therefore reject non-mentioned messages.
- The coordinator bot must still be instructed to stay silent when another bot is explicitly mentioned; this skill does that via group `systemPrompt`.
- If a specialist bot never receives group traffic even when @mentioned, check Feishu app permissions first.

## When behavior is still wrong

Read `references/troubleshooting.md` and check logs for these patterns:
- Good specialist rejection on plain message:
  - `rejected: no bot mention`
- Good coordinator silence when another bot is mentioned:
  - `dispatch complete (replies=0)`
- Broken specialist delivery:
  - no inbound log lines for that account at all
