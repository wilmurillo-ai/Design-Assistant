# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **Simplified SKILL.md**: Removed the complex 3-step async/poll workflow from the main instructions. The script already handles all polling internally — the SKILL.md now reflects this with a single, clean "run and get result" pattern.
- **Unified output format**: All models now return a consistent `{ success, model, imageUrl, images, jobId }` shape, making it easier to handle results uniformly.
- **Clearer model selection table**: Added "Speed" column so agents can make better trade-off decisions.
- **Added "Use when" trigger**: SKILL.md now starts with a clear activation condition so the agent knows exactly when to invoke this skill.
- **Documented `--reference-images` for Nano Banana**: Pass comma-separated URLs for character/style consistency across sequential image generations.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Non-blocking async mode for Midjourney** (`--async` flag). Submit a job and return immediately with `job_id`, without waiting for completion. This prevents the bot from being blocked while waiting for image generation.
- **Status poll mode** (`--poll --job-id <id>`). Check job status once and return immediately — no waiting. Returns `status: "completed"`, `"pending"`, `"processing"`, or `"failed"`.
- Updated SKILL.md with mandatory async workflow documentation. All Midjourney requests should now use `--async` + periodic `--poll` to avoid blocking the bot.

### Changed
- `--async` flag is supported for all Midjourney actions: `imagine`, `upscale`, `variation`, `reroll`.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- **Midjourney Turbo mode enabled by default.** The `--turbo` flag is now automatically appended to all Midjourney prompts, reducing generation time from ~30-60s to ~10-20s (requires Midjourney Pro or Mega subscription).
- Added `--mode` parameter: `turbo` (default), `fast`, `relax`.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- **Midjourney provider switched from TTAPI to Legnext.ai** for faster generation speed and higher stability.
- Environment variable renamed from `TTAPI_KEY` to `LEGNEXT_KEY`. Please update your OpenClaw config.
- Upscale now supports `--upscale-type` parameter: `0` = Subtle (default), `1` = Creative.
- Variation now supports `--variation-type` parameter: `0` = Subtle (default), `1` = Strong.
- Added `--action reroll` support for Midjourney.
- Added `--action describe` support for Midjourney.
- Response now includes `imageUrls` array (4 individual image URLs) in addition to the grid `imageUrl`.

### Migration Guide
If you were using `TTAPI_KEY`, please:
1. Register at [legnext.ai](https://legnext.ai) and get your API key.
2. Update `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`: rename `TTAPI_KEY` to `LEGNEXT_KEY` and set your new key.
