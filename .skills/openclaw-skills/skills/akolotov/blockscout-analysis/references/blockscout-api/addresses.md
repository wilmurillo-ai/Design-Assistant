### JSON-RPC Compatibility

These are Etherscan-compatible legacy endpoints. When using `direct_api_call`, set `endpoint_path="/api"` and pass `module`, `action`, and any other parameters via `query_params`. The `module` and `action` values are part of the endpoint identity and are not listed in the parameter tables below.

#### GET /api?module=account&action=eth_get_balance

Returns the ETH balance of an address in an Ethereum-compatible hex format (0x-prefixed). **The returned value is hex-encoded and must be decoded from hexadecimal to obtain the balance in wei.** For example, `0xde0b6b3a7640000` decodes to `1000000000000000000` wei (1 ETH). Pass a specific block number in the `block` parameter to retrieve the historical balance at that block. When calling via `direct_api_call`, use `endpoint_path="/api"` and pass all parameters in `query_params`.

- **Parameters**

  | Name | Type | Required | Description |
  | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `address` | `string` | Yes | The address to check balance for. |
  | `block` | `string` | No | Block identifier: `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, or a decimal block number as a string. Defaults to `latest`. Use a specific block number to query historical balance. |
