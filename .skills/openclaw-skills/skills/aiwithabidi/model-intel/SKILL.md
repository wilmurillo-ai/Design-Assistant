# Model Intel 🧠💰

Live LLM model intelligence — pricing, capabilities, and comparisons from OpenRouter.

## When to Use

- Finding the best model for a specific task (coding, reasoning, creative, fast, cheap)
- Comparing model pricing and capabilities
- Checking current model availability and context lengths
- Answering "what's the cheapest model that can do X?"

## Usage

```bash
# List top models by provider
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py list

# Search by name
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py search "claude"

# Side-by-side comparison
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py compare "claude-opus" "gpt-4o"

# Best model for a use case
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py best fast
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py best code
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py best reasoning
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py best cheap
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py best vision

# Pricing details
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_intel.py price "gemini-flash"
```

## Use Cases

| Command | When |
|---------|------|
| `best fast` | Need lowest latency |
| `best cheap` | Budget-constrained |
| `best code` | Programming tasks |
| `best reasoning` | Complex logic/math |
| `best vision` | Image understanding |
| `best long-context` | Large document processing |
