# 🏗️ OpenClaw Architect

The definitive skill for understanding, configuring, debugging, and optimizing OpenClaw deployments. Built from real production experience.

## Features

- **Analyze configurations** — audit openclaw.json and suggest improvements
- **Health check systems** — validate all OpenClaw subsystems in one command
- **Configure model routing** — set up primary models, fallback chains, cost tiers
- **Build skills** — SKILL.md format, CLI design, publishing to ClawHub
- **Debug gateway issues** — troubleshoot errors, cron failures, session crashes
- **Optimize performance** — model selection, cost reduction, context management
- **Manage cron jobs** — scheduling, error handling, retry patterns
- **Configure memory systems** — Qdrant, Neo4j, SQLite integration
- **Deploy infrastructure** — Docker, Tailscale VPN, networking
- **Post-update verification** — checklist for safe OpenClaw upgrades

## Requirements

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` | ✅ | Path to OpenClaw workspace directory |

## Quick Start

```bash
PY=~/.openclaw/workspace/.venv/bin/python3

# Analyze your openclaw.json configuration
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/config_analyzer.py

# Health check all OpenClaw systems
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/health_check.py
```

## Commands

### Config Analyzer
```bash
# Audit current configuration
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/config_analyzer.py

# Analyze a specific config file
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/config_analyzer.py --config /path/to/openclaw.json
```

### Health Check
```bash
# Check all subsystems
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/health_check.py

# Check specific subsystem
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/health_check.py --check gateway
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/health_check.py --check cron
$PY skills/openclaw-architect/scripts/health_check.py --check memory
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Brain-First** — Strategic content → Mem0/Qdrant/Neo4j/SQLite. Markdown = operational logs only.
2. **Fault-Tolerant** — Always configure 2+ fallback models. Test each one works.
3. **Credit-Aware** — Monitor usage, auto-switch tiers, alert before exhaustion.
4. **Skills = Publishing** — Every reusable pattern becomes a ClawHub skill.
5. **Self-Monitoring** — System watches its own health, uptime, costs via cron.
6. **Automate Repetition** — If it happens twice → cron job or script.

## Script Reference

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `{baseDir}/scripts/config_analyzer.py` | Audits openclaw.json configuration |
| `{baseDir}/scripts/health_check.py` | Validates all OpenClaw subsystems |

## Output Format

All commands output structured text with clear pass/fail indicators and actionable recommendations.

## Data Policy

This skill reads local configuration files only. No data is sent to external services.
