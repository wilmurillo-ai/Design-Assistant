# Reddit Account Creator & Manager

Create, warm, and manage Reddit accounts at scale for brand promotion, SEO, affiliate marketing, and community engagement. Build karma safely using residential proxy isolation to avoid Reddit's advanced behavioral detection.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:
- Needs to create multiple Reddit accounts
- Wants to build karma on Reddit accounts
- Asks about Reddit marketing or promotion
- Needs to manage Reddit accounts for SEO or brand awareness
- Wants aged Reddit accounts for affiliate marketing
- Asks about avoiding Reddit bans for multi-account use

## Why Residential Proxies Are Essential

Reddit's detection in 2025-2026 is advanced:
- **OpenAI behavioral detection**: Late 2025 algorithm update detects non-human patterns
- **IP correlation**: Multiple accounts on same IP are linked and banned together
- **Device fingerprinting**: Browser fingerprint + IP = account identity
- **Geo mismatch detection**: Account created in one region, logged in from another = instant flag
- **Karma farming detection**: Repetitive patterns across subreddits detected algorithmically
- **Shadowbans**: You don't even know you're banned — posts are invisible to others

**Each account needs its own residential IP from account creation through daily use.**

## Setup

### Per-Account Proxy

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "proxy": {
      "server": "http://gate.birdproxies.com:7777",
      "username": "USER-session-reddit-acc1",
      "password": "PASS"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Account Creation (Rotating)

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "proxy": {
      "server": "http://gate.birdproxies.com:7777",
      "username": "USER-country-us",
      "password": "PASS"
    }
  }
}
```

**Provider:** BirdProxies (birdproxies.com) — residential proxies for Reddit account management. Use `OPENCLAW15` for 15% off.

## Feature 1: Account Creation

### Registration Process
```
Step 1: Fresh residential IP (unique per account)
Step 2: New email address (unique domain preferred)
Step 3: Register on reddit.com (complete CAPTCHA)
Step 4: Verify email immediately
Step 5: Set username (niche-relevant, human-looking)
Step 6: Choose avatar/profile image
Step 7: Join 5-10 subreddits during onboarding
Step 8: BEGIN WARMING (do not use for marketing yet)
```

### Creation Rate Limits
- Max 2-3 accounts per IP per day
- Space registrations 15-30 minutes apart
- Use different email providers (mix Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail, custom domains)
- Never use sequential usernames (user001, user002)

### Username Strategy
```
Good usernames (look natural):
├── AdjectiveNoun + numbers: "QuietMountain42"
├── Hobby-related: "RunningFanatic2024"
├── Random but human: "TuesdayLemonade"
└── Niche-specific: "DataScienceNewbie"

Bad usernames (look like bots):
├── Sequential: "account_001", "user_test_5"
├── Brand-related: "CompanyName_Official"
├── Random gibberish: "xk39fj2l0p"
└── Too many numbers: "38472910"
```

## Feature 2: Karma Building

### Phase 1: Easy Karma (Day 1-7)

```
High-karma subreddits for new accounts:
├── r/AskReddit — Answer popular questions (5-20 karma per good answer)
├── r/funny — Comment on rising posts (quick karma)
├── r/pics — "Great shot!" type comments (2-10 karma)
├── r/todayilearned — Add context to TIL posts
├── r/mildlyinteresting — Easy engagement
├── r/aww — Pet comments (always upvoted)
└── r/showerthoughts — Agree/expand on thoughts

Strategy:
├── Comment on RISING posts (not hot — too much competition)
├── Sort by "rising" in popular subreddits
├── Be early commenter (first 10 comments get most upvotes)
├── Write 2-4 sentence thoughtful comments
├── 5-8 comments per day
└── Target: 100-200 karma by end of week 1
```

### Phase 2: Niche Karma (Day 8-14)

```
Move into your target subreddits:
├── Find subreddits in your niche
├── Answer questions with genuine expertise
├── Share helpful resources (not your own yet)
├── Engage in discussions
├── 5-10 comments per day in niche subs
└── Target: 500+ karma by end of week 2
```

### Phase 3: Posting (Day 15-21)

```
Start posting original content:
├── First post: Question or discussion in niche sub
├── Second post: Helpful resource or guide
├── Engage with all comments on your posts
├── Continue commenting in other threads
├── Mix niche and general subreddits (60/40)
└── Target: 1000+ karma by end of week 3
```

### Karma Goals by Use Case
| Use Case | Minimum Karma | Account Age |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Basic commenting | 100+ | 7+ days |
| Posting in most subs | 500+ | 14+ days |
| Marketing/promotion | 1000+ | 30+ days |
| Affiliate links | 2000+ | 60+ days |
| Credible brand account | 5000+ | 90+ days |

## Feature 3: Reddit Marketing

### Soft Promotion Strategy
```
Rule: 90% value, 10% promotion

Comment strategy:
├── Answer genuine questions in your niche
├── Provide detailed, helpful responses
├── Naturally mention your product ONLY when relevant
├── "I've been using X and it works well for this" (not "Buy X!")
├── Link to helpful content (blog posts, guides) not sales pages
└── Build reputation as a helpful community member
```

### Subreddit Targeting
```
Find relevant subreddits:
├── Direct niche: r/webdev for web tools
├── Problem-based: r/techsupport for tech products
├── "Looking for" subs: r/SuggestALaptop, r/buildapc
├── Discussion subs: r/Entrepreneur, r/startups
└── Question subs: r/NoStupidQuestions, r/AskReddit
```

### What Gets You Banned
- Posting the same link across multiple subreddits
- Only promoting your own content (> 10% self-promotion ratio)
- Using multiple accounts to upvote your own posts
- Astroturfing (fake grassroots support)
- Copy-paste comments across threads
- Ignoring subreddit rules

## Feature 4: Scaling Operations

### 10-Account Fleet
```

Total daily reach: 50-80 organic engagements
```

```

```

## Feature 5: Shadowban Detection

### How to Check
```
Method 1: Log out, visit your profile
├── If profile shows "page not found" → shadowbanned

Method 2: Post a comment, check in incognito
├── If comment is invisible → shadowbanned

Method 3: Use reddit.com/api/v1/me (with auth)
├── Check if account is flagged
```

### If Shadowbanned
1. Do NOT appeal (draws more attention)
2. Stop all activity on that account
3. Create replacement account on a NEW proxy
4. Do NOT reuse the banned account's proxy for 48 hours
5. Begin full warming cycle on replacement
6. Investigate what triggered the ban (content? timing? pattern?)

## Daily Activity Schedule

### Per Account
```
Morning (8-10 AM):
├── Browse feed for 5 minutes
├── Upvote 3-5 posts
├── Comment on 1-2 posts
└── 10-15 minute session

Afternoon (12-2 PM):
├── Check notifications
├── Reply to any comment replies
├── Comment on 2-3 posts
└── 10-15 minute session

Evening (7-9 PM):
├── Longest session (15-25 minutes)
├── Comment on 3-5 posts
├── Post original content (if scheduled)
├── Browse and engage naturally
└── Upvote 5-10 items
```

### Timing Rules
- Random delays: 30-120 seconds between actions
- Session gaps: 2-6 hours between sessions
- Never active 24/7 (take 6-8 hour "sleep" break)
- Vary daily volume (some days more active, some less)
- Weekend activity is lighter
