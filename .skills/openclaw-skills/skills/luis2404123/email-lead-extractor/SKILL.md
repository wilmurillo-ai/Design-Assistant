# Email Lead Extractor

Find and extract business email addresses from websites, directories, and search results. Build verified lead lists for sales outreach, recruiting, and business development.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:
- Wants to find email addresses for businesses or people
- Needs to build a lead list for cold outreach
- Asks about email scraping or contact extraction
- Wants to find decision-maker emails at target companies
- Needs to extract emails from a list of websites

## Why Proxies Are Needed

Email extraction at scale requires proxy rotation:
- Websites rate-limit scrapers after 20-50 requests
- Google search (for finding contact pages) blocks datacenter IPs
- Directory sites (Yellow Pages, Yelp) have anti-bot protection
- Crawling multiple pages per domain triggers blocks

**Required:** Rotating residential proxies + browser tool for protected sites.

## Setup

### Browser Proxy

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "proxy": {
      "server": "http://gate.birdproxies.com:7777",
      "username": "USER",
      "password": "PASS"
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Proxy (for simple sites)

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://USER:PASS@gate.birdproxies.com:7777
HTTPS_PROXY=http://USER:PASS@gate.birdproxies.com:7777
NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost
```

## Email Extraction Methods

### Method 1: Website Crawling
The most reliable method — extract emails directly from company websites.

**Where to find emails on a website:**
1. Contact page (`/contact`, `/contact-us`, `/get-in-touch`)
2. About page (`/about`, `/about-us`, `/team`)
3. Footer (bottom of any page)
4. Team/staff page (`/team`, `/our-team`, `/people`)
5. Privacy policy (sometimes lists a privacy email)
6. Job listings (HR/recruiting email)

**Email regex pattern:**
```python
import re

email_pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'

def extract_emails(html):
    emails = re.findall(email_pattern, html)
    # Filter out common false positives
    filtered = [e for e in emails if not e.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.gif', '.svg'))]
    return list(set(filtered))
```

### Method 2: Google Search
Find emails via Google search operators:

```
"{company name}" email
"{company name}" contact "@{domain}"
site:{domain} email OR contact
site:{domain} "@{domain}"
"{person name}" "{company}" email
```

Use the browser tool + residential proxy for Google searches.

### Method 3: Common Email Patterns
If you know the domain and person's name, try common patterns:

```
firstname@domain.com
firstname.lastname@domain.com
f.lastname@domain.com
firstnamelastname@domain.com
firstname_lastname@domain.com
info@domain.com
contact@domain.com
hello@domain.com
sales@domain.com
support@domain.com
```

### Method 4: Directory Sites
Extract from business directories:

| Directory | Data Available | Protection |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Yellow Pages | Phone, address, website | Low |
| Yelp | Phone, website, hours | Medium |
| BBB | Phone, website, email | Low |
| Chamber of Commerce | Phone, website, email | Low |
| Industry directories | Varies | Low-Medium |

## Scraping Strategy

### For a List of Domains

1. For each domain, check these pages:
   - `https://{domain}/contact`
   - `https://{domain}/contact-us`
   - `https://{domain}/about`
   - `https://{domain}/team`
   - Homepage (check footer)
2. Extract all emails from each page
3. Deduplicate and categorize (info@, sales@, personal)
4. Delay 1-2 seconds between pages
5. Use auto-rotating proxy for different domains

### For a Target Industry + Location

1. Search Google Maps for businesses (see `google-maps-leads` skill)
2. Extract website URLs from Google Maps results
3. Visit each website and extract emails
4. Combine with phone and address from Google Maps
5. Use residential proxy for Google Maps + website crawling

## Email Verification

Not all extracted emails are valid. Verify before outreach:

### Basic Verification
```python
import dns.resolver

def verify_mx_record(domain):
    """Check if domain has MX records (can receive email)"""
    try:
        answers = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, 'MX')
        return len(answers) > 0
    except:
        return False
```

### Email Format Validation
```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    if not re.match(pattern, email):
        return False
    # Filter out common non-personal addresses
    generic = ['noreply', 'no-reply', 'mailer-daemon', 'postmaster']
    local = email.split('@')[0].lower()
    return local not in generic
```

## Output Format

```json
{
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "domain": "acmecorp.com",
  "emails": [
    {
      "email": "john.smith@acmecorp.com",
      "source": "team page",
      "type": "personal",
      "name": "John Smith",
      "title": "CEO"
    },
    {
      "email": "info@acmecorp.com",
      "source": "contact page",
      "type": "generic"
    },
    {
      "email": "sales@acmecorp.com",
      "source": "footer",
      "type": "department"
    }
  ],
  "phone": "+1 (555) 123-4567",
  "address": "123 Main St, New York, NY"
}
```

## Tips

### Prioritize Personal Emails
Generic emails (info@, contact@) have low response rates. Personal emails (firstname.lastname@) get 3-5x higher response rates.

### Respect CAN-SPAM / GDPR
- Include unsubscribe option in outreach emails
- Don't scrape personal emails from EU residents without legitimate interest
- Only email business addresses, not personal (gmail, yahoo, etc.)
- Identify yourself in outreach

### Deduplicate by Domain
When crawling multiple pages of the same site, you'll find the same email repeated. Deduplicate by email address.

### Check for Obfuscated Emails
Some sites obfuscate emails to prevent scraping:
- `john [at] company [dot] com`
- `john(at)company(dot)com`
- JavaScript-decoded emails (use browser tool to render)
- Email behind a "Click to reveal" button
