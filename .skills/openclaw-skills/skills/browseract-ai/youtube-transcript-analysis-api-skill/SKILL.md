# YouTube Transcript Analysis API Skill

## 📖 Brief
This skill provides an end-to-end YouTube video transcript extraction and deep content analysis service. By extracting video transcripts and then systematically analyzing them, users can understand competitors' core value propositions, target audience profiles, pain point strategies, and content gaps — all without manually watching hours of video.

**This skill works in two phases:**
1. **Phase 1 — Transcript Extraction**: Uses BrowserAct API to extract raw transcript data (supports single video and batch modes).
2. **Phase 2 — Deep Analysis**: The Agent performs structured 8-dimension analysis on the extracted transcripts.

## ✨ Features
1. **No hallucinations, ensuring stable and accurate data extraction**: Pre-set workflows avoid AI generative hallucinations, ensuring stable and precise data extraction.
2. **No CAPTCHA issues**: No need to handle reCAPTCHA or other verification challenges.
3. **No IP restrictions or geo-blocking**: No need to handle regional IP restrictions or geofencing.
4. **Faster execution**: Tasks execute faster compared to pure AI-driven browser automation solutions.
5. **Extremely high cost-efficiency**: Significantly lowers data acquisition costs compared to high-token-consuming AI solutions.

## 🔑 API Key Guide
Before running, check the `BROWSERACT_API_KEY` environment variable. If not set, do not take other measures; ask and wait for the user to provide it.
**Agent must inform the user**:
> "Since you haven't configured the BrowserAct API Key yet, please go to the [BrowserAct Console](https://www.browseract.com/reception/integrations) to get your Key."

## 🛠️ Input Parameters
The Agent should determine the extraction mode based on the user's needs:

### Mode A: Single Video Analysis
Use when the user provides a specific YouTube video URL.

1. **TargetURL**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The URL of the YouTube video to extract and analyze.
   - **Example**: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st534T7-mdE`
   - **Required**: Yes

### Mode B: Batch Video Analysis
Use when the user wants to search and analyze multiple videos by keyword.

1. **KeyWords**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The keyword to search for on YouTube.
   - **Example**: `AI Automation`, `SaaS Marketing`
   - **Required**: Yes

2. **Upload_date**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: Filter for the upload date of the videos.
   - **Example**: `This week`
   - **Default**: `This week`

3. **Datelimit**
   - **Type**: `number`
   - **Description**: The number of videos to extract and analyze.
   - **Example**: `3`
   - **Default**: `3`

### Optional Analysis Parameters
These parameters are set by the user's intent, not script arguments:

4. **Analysis Language**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The language the analysis report should be written in. Defaults to the same language as the user's request.
   - **Example**: `Chinese`, `English`

5. **Analysis Focus**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The user may specify an analysis focus. The Agent must dynamically adjust the depth of specific dimensions based on this focus. For example:
     - *Competitor Analysis* -> Deep dive into Dim 7 (Business Model) and Dim 8 (Gaps).
     - *Viral Deconstruction* -> Deep dive into Dim 1 (Hook), Dim 4 (Emotional Arc), and Dim 5 (Viral Drivers).
     - *Audience Research* -> Deep dive into Dim 3 (Persona & Intent) and Dim 4 (Pain Points).
   - **Default**: All 8 dimensions balanced.
   - **Example**: `Competitor Analysis`, `Viral Deconstruction`, `Audience Research`

## 🚀 Invocation Method
The Agent should execute the unified extraction script based on the mode:

**Mode A — Single Video:**
```bash
python -u ./scripts/youtube_transcript_analysis_api.py single "TargetURL"
```

**Mode B — Batch Videos:**
```bash
python -u ./scripts/youtube_transcript_analysis_api.py batch "keywords" "Upload_date" Datelimit
```

### ⏳ Running Status Monitoring
Since this task involves automated browser operations, it may take several minutes. The script will **continuously output status logs with timestamps** (e.g., `[14:30:05] Task Status: running`).
**Agent guidelines**:
- While waiting for the script to return results, keep monitoring the terminal output.
- As long as the terminal continues to output new status logs, the task is running normally. Do not misjudge it as deadlocked.
- Only consider triggering the retry mechanism if the status remains unchanged for a long time or the script stops outputting without returning a result.

### Post-Extraction Workflow
After the script completes and returns transcript data, the Agent must proceed with two additional steps:

**Step 1: Present Video Metadata** — Display the extracted metadata to the user. *(Note: Do NOT output the full raw transcript text in your response, as it is too long. Use it internally for your analysis.)*

**Step 2: Perform Concise 8-Dimension Analysis** — Analyze the transcript across the 8 dimensions. ⚠️ **CRITICAL: The analysis MUST be extremely concise, bullet-point driven, and free of filler words.** Directly state the facts, evidence, and actionable insights without verbose explanations. Use the same language as the user's request.

## 📊 Data Output
After successful execution, the output includes two parts:

### Part 1: Video Metadata
The script returns the following fields for each video:
- `video_title`: The title of the YouTube video
- `video_url`: The direct link to the original video
- `publisher`: The name of the channel publishing the video
- `channel_link`: The URL of the publisher's YouTube channel
- `video_likes_count`: The number of likes the video has received
- `transcript`: The complete extracted transcript/subtitles of the video (used internally for analysis, do not display full text)

### Part 2: 8-Dimension Analysis
After presenting raw data, the Agent must produce structured analysis on the transcript content across the following 8 dimensions:

#### Dimension 1: Content Structure & Hook
Analyze the video's narrative architecture:
- **Opening Hook**: What is the core hook in the first 30 seconds? Quote it and explain the hook logic (e.g., curiosity gap, bold claim).
- **Narrative Framework**: Identify the overall structure (e.g., Problem-Agitate-Solve, Hero's Journey, Listicle).
- **Pacing & Time Allocation**: Proportion of intro vs. core content vs. pitch/CTA.

#### Dimension 2: Core Messaging
Extract the central message:
- **Single Core Viewpoint**: What is the ONE key thesis the video conveys?
- **Supporting Arguments**: How is the viewpoint supported? (Data, analogies, personal experience).
- **Conclusion Clarity**: Is the conclusion clear and memorable?

#### Dimension 3: Audience Persona & Intent
Identify the intended viewer and their mindset:
- **Target Viewer Profile & Level**: Who is this for? (Beginner, Expert) What prior knowledge is assumed?
- **Viewer Intent**: Why are they watching? (To learn a skill, be entertained, make a buying decision, or validate existing beliefs?)

#### Dimension 4: Pain Points & Emotional Arc
Map the emotional journey and problems addressed:
- **Explicit & Implicit Pain Points**: What specific problems are stated or implied? Quote exact words.
- **Emotional Arc**: How does the content shift the viewer's emotion? (e.g., from anxiety/confusion to clarity/relief/empowerment). This emotional shift drives retention and sharing.

#### Dimension 5: Viral & Engagement Drivers
Analyze the spreading mechanism:
- **Shareability Factors**: Why is this video shared? (Controversial takes, highly relatable scenarios, title/thumbnail alignment inferred from script).
- **Memorable/Quotable Phrasing**: Extract unique expressions, catchy concepts, or "aha" moments that stick in the mind.

#### Dimension 6: Evidence & Credibility
Evaluate trust-building elements:
- **Authority Signals**: Data cited, expert references, or professional background mentioned.
- **Social Proof & Empathy**: Real user stories, case studies, or the creator sharing their own past struggles to build rapport.

#### Dimension 7: Business Model & Conversion
Deconstruct the monetization and CTA strategy:
- **Primary Monetization Goal**: What is the underlying business purpose? (Ad revenue, selling a course, affiliate marketing, brand sponsorship, lead generation).
- **CTA Strategy**: What actions are requested? How is urgency or value constructed to drive this action?

#### Dimension 8: Categorized Content Gaps
Identify strategic opportunities by splitting gaps into three layers:
- **Creator's Weaknesses**: Arguments that lack evidence, logical flaws, or poorly explained concepts.
- **Unresolved Viewer Questions**: What specific questions would the audience still have after watching?
- **Industry Whitespace**: What related angles or broader perspectives did the video entirely miss that you could cover?

```

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Retry
If an error occurs during script execution (e.g., network fluctuations or task failure), the Agent should follow this logic:

1. **Check Output Content**:
   - If the output **contains** `"Invalid authorization"`, it means the API Key is invalid or expired. **Do not retry**; guide the user to re-check and provide the correct API Key.
   - If the output **contains** `"concurrent"` or `"too many running tasks"` or similar concurrency limit messages, it means the current subscription plan's concurrent task limit has been reached. **Do not retry**; guide the user to upgrade their plan.
     **Agent must inform the user**:
     > "The current task cannot be executed because your BrowserAct account has reached the limit of concurrent tasks. Please go to the [BrowserAct Plan Upgrade Page](https://www.browseract.com/reception/recharge) to upgrade your subscription plan and enjoy more concurrent task benefits."
   - If the output **does not contain** the above error keywords but the task failed (e.g., output starts with `Error:` or returns empty results), the Agent should **automatically try to re-execute the script once**.

2. **Retry Limit**:
   - Automatic retry is limited to **one time**. If the second attempt fails, stop retrying and report the specific error information to the user.

3. **Analysis Phase Notes**:
   - If the transcript is too short (fewer than 50 words), note this and provide analysis only on available content.
   - If the transcript appears to be auto-generated and contains many errors, note this caveat at the beginning of the analysis.
