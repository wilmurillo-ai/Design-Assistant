name: double-agent
description: >
  This skill should be used when designing, implementing, or improving any AI system that requires
  quality assurance through separation of generation and evaluation roles. It implements the
  Generator-Evaluator dual-agent architecture (inspired by Anthropic's engineering blog and GAN design),
  where a Generator produces outputs and a dedicated Evaluator agent independently validates them
  through real interaction (e.g., Playwright browser operations), eliminating AI self-evaluation bias.
  Use when: building AI-generated UIs/code that needs quality checks, designing multi-agent pipelines
  with feedback loops, or upgrading existing coder+tester workflows to real interaction-based evaluation.

# DoubleAgent Skill

## Purpose

The DoubleAgent pattern solves a fundamental problem in AI-generated software: **AI self-evaluation bias**.

When a single AI agent both generates and evaluates its own output, it systematically overestimates quality — the same cognitive conflict that occurs when a student grades their own exam. The solution is to **forcibly separate the two cognitive roles** into independent agents with different prompts, goals, and evaluation criteria.

This skill provides:
1. **Architecture templates** for Generator-Evaluator agent pairs
2. **Evaluator prompt templates** calibrated with few-shot scoring examples
3. **Iteration loop design** for 5-15 round refinement cycles
4. **Playwright integration patterns** for real browser-based evaluation
5. **Scoring rubric design** to prevent score drift and grade inflation

## Core Architecture

```
User Goal / Spec
      ↓
 ┌─────────────┐
 │  Generator  │ ← Produces output (code, UI, content, data)
 └──────┬──────┘
        │ output artifact
        ↓
 ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
 │           Evaluator                │
 │  • Reads spec (NOT generator output)│
 │  • Operates artifact via Playwright │
 │    (click, fill form, navigate)     │
 │  • Scores on rubric (0-100)         │
 │  • Writes structured feedback       │
 └────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │ score + feedback
                  ↓
         ┌────────────────┐
         │ Score ≥ target? │
         │   YES → Done    │
         │   NO → Loop     │
         └────────┬────────┘
                  │
                  └──→ Generator (next iteration)
```

**Key principle**: The Evaluator reads the **original spec**, not the Generator's output. It evaluates independently, as if it were a real user encountering the product for the first time.

## When to Apply

| Scenario | Apply DoubleAgent? |
|----------|--------------------|
| AI-generated frontend UI with interactions | ✅ Yes |
| Multi-step workflow code (forms, flows) | ✅ Yes |
| API endpoint implementation + validation | ✅ Yes |
| Content generation (reports, copy, docs) | ✅ Yes (text-based evaluator) |
| Single-function refactoring | ⚠️ Optional |
| Simple config changes | ❌ Not needed |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define the Spec Contract

Write a clear spec that both agents will reference independently. The spec must be:
- Concrete (measurable outcomes, not vague goals)
- Observable (evaluable through interaction or inspection)
- Versioned (so both agents work from the same contract)

See `references/architecture.md` for spec template.

### Step 2: Configure the Generator Agent

Assign the Generator a single role: **produce output that satisfies the spec**.

- Do NOT ask the Generator to self-evaluate
- Do NOT include evaluation criteria in the Generator's prompt
- Provide: spec + iteration history + previous evaluator feedback

### Step 3: Configure the Evaluator Agent

Assign the Evaluator a single role: **independently verify the spec is satisfied**.

- Load `references/evaluator-prompts.md` for calibrated prompt templates
- Use Playwright MCP for UI/web artifacts (real browser interaction)
- Use structured JSON output for scores to enable automated loop control
- Calibrate with few-shot examples BEFORE running (prevents grade inflation)

### Step 4: Design the Iteration Loop

```python
MAX_ROUNDS = 15
PASS_THRESHOLD = 80  # out of 100

for round in range(MAX_ROUNDS):
    output = generator.run(spec, history)
    evaluation = evaluator.run(spec, output)  # Playwright-based
    
    history.append({"round": round, "score": evaluation.score, "feedback": evaluation.feedback})
    
    if evaluation.score >= PASS_THRESHOLD:
        break
    
    if evaluation.score_trend == "plateauing":
        generator.switch_approach()  # Complete strategy reset
```

See `scripts/iteration_loop.py` for a complete implementation template.

### Step 5: Calibrate the Evaluator

To prevent score drift, run the Evaluator on 3-5 known examples FIRST:
- 1 example at ~30/100 (clearly bad)
- 1 example at ~60/100 (mediocre)
- 1 example at ~85/100 (good)
- 1 example at ~95/100 (excellent)

If scores deviate >15 points from expected, adjust the Evaluator's prompt or rubric weights before the real run.

## Scoring Rubric Design

Effective rubrics for software systems:

| Dimension | Weight | What to Measure |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Functional completeness | 30% | Does each spec requirement work end-to-end? |
| Interaction quality | 25% | Click/form/navigation behavior as a real user |
| Edge case handling | 20% | Error states, empty data, boundary inputs |
| Code/design quality | 15% | Consistency, readability, no obvious anti-patterns |
| Originality / craft | 10% | Avoids generic/template outputs when spec requires uniqueness |

Adjust weights based on the domain. For content systems, increase "originality". For data pipelines, increase "edge case handling".

## Playwright Integration (for UI artifacts)

When evaluating web/H5/mini-program outputs, the Evaluator should:

1. **Navigate** to the deployed artifact URL
2. **Execute** each spec requirement as a user action sequence
3. **Observe** actual behavior (DOM state, network requests, visual output)
4. **Record** pass/fail per requirement with screenshots
5. **Report** structured JSON with score breakdown

Playwright MCP tool calls to use:
- `playwright_navigate` → open URL
- `playwright_click` → interact with elements
- `playwright_fill` → fill form inputs
- `playwright_screenshot` → capture evidence
- `playwright_get_visible_text` → verify content
