## Price Normalization

Different sources use different formats. `normalize_price` converts any format to a common structure.

| Source | Format | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESPN | American odds | `-150` | Favorite, implied 60% |
| Polymarket | Probability (0-1) | `0.65` | 65% implied probability |
| Kalshi | Integer (0-100) | `65` | 65% implied probability |

**Normalized output shape:**
```json
{
  "implied_probability": 0.65,
  "american": -185.7,
  "decimal": 1.5385,
  "source": "polymarket"
}
```

## Partial Results Behavior

If one source is unavailable, the module returns what it has with warnings:
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "games": [],
    "warnings": ["Kalshi search failed: connection timeout"]
  }
}
```
