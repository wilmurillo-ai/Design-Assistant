# ScaleOS Readiness Scorecard

Use this before starting any playbook. Score yourself honestly -- not against what you plan to do, but against what is actually running today.

Score each question: **1 = Yes, 0 = No.**

---

## Section 1: Foundation

### F1: Positioning & Differentiation

| # | Question | Score |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | Can you describe your ICP in 30 seconds with zero ambiguity -- company type, headcount, buying trigger? | |
| 2 | Do you know the specific trigger event that makes a prospect a buyer right now (not the category, the trigger)? | |
| 3 | Have you spoken to at least 5 current or past clients to validate their pain in their exact words? | |
| 4 | Do you have a competitive moat -- something defensible that competitors cannot easily copy? | |

**F1 Score: __ / 4**

### F2: Business Model Design

| # | Question | Score |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | Can you state your offer as an outcome (what the client achieves) rather than a deliverable (what you produce)? | |

| 3 | Could the business run for one week without founder involvement? | |

**F3 Score: __ / 3**

### F4: Financial Architecture

| # | Question | Score |
|---|----------|-------|

## Overall Scoring

## After scoring: find your segment

Once you have your score and know which brick to start with, read your business type's archetype file. It maps which bricks matter most at your current stage and where founders in your category most commonly get stuck.

|---------------|---------------|
| B2B SaaS, vertical SaaS, AI SaaS | `playbooks/segments/startup-archetypes/b2b-saas.md` |

## Scoring Notes

- Do not inflate scores. Answer based on what is actually running today.
- If a section scores 0, the playbooks in that area will not work yet. Fix first.
- Re-run this scorecard monthly. A complete ScaleOS operation should score 35+ out of 41 within 6-12 months.
