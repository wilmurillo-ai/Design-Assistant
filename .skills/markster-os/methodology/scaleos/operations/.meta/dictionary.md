## Usage Rules

1. **Exact match only.** If a term is not in this dictionary by its canonical name, validation fails.
2. **Add before use.** New terms must be added to this dictionary before they can appear in any block.
3. **One name per thing.** If the same tool appears in two categories, pick the primary category.
4. **Planned = noted.** Terms marked "(planned)" or "(not yet built)" are valid but signal the process depends on future work.
