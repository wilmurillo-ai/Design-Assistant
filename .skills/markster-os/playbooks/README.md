# Playbooks

Each playbook is a deterministic sequence. Defined inputs, fixed steps, documented outputs.

Playbooks are not general advice. They are step-by-step operating procedures organized by the GOD Engine brick they serve. Foundation (F1-F4) must be complete before most playbooks produce useful results -- the bricks draw directly from your F1-F4 answers.

## How playbooks work

```
INPUTS
What you need before you start. If you do not have these, stop and complete them first.

STEPS
Numbered steps in sequence. Each step has a specific action, a tool or template reference, and a completion signal.

OUTPUTS
The concrete deliverables the playbook produces. You should be able to hand these to someone else.
```

The skills in this OS activate playbooks in your AI environment. You can also run playbooks manually -- open the README and follow the steps.

## Playbook conventions

**Templates:** Each brick playbook has a `templates/` subdirectory (or sub-playbooks) with real starting-point materials. Not placeholder text -- actual drafts you can edit and use.

**Skill activation:** Each playbook has a corresponding skill in `/skills/`. The skill adds context-awareness: it checks your Foundation answers, asks clarifying questions, and tailors execution to your specific ICP and offer.

**Iteration loops:** Every playbook includes what to measure and what to change first on the next run.
