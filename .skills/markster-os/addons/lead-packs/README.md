# Lead Packs - Pre-Built Contact Lists

Pre-built, verified contact lists for specific verticals and geographies. Skip the list-building step and start your cold email playbook faster.

---

## What it does

Lead Packs are curated, verified contact lists organized by vertical, company size, geography, and decision-maker role. They are built to match the ICP profiles most commonly used in the Markster OS cold email playbook.

**Each pack includes:**

- Full name and verified business email
- Company name, size range, and industry
- Decision-maker title and LinkedIn URL
- Company website and estimated revenue range
- Verification date (all emails verified within 30 days of delivery)
- Bounce rate guarantee: if bounce rate exceeds 5% on send, replacement contacts provided

## Who it is for

Use Lead Packs when:
- You have F1 (ICP) and the messaging guide complete but want to skip manual list building
- You need a list fast for a time-sensitive campaign
- You want a baseline contact list for a new vertical you have not targeted before
- You are testing a new sequence and need 200-300 contacts to generate statistically meaningful data

Do not use Lead Packs as a substitute for F1. The ICP definition still needs to be correct - Lead Packs just skip the manual sourcing step.
