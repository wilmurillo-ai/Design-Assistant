# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenFang will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.10] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Non-loopback requests with no `api_key` configured now return 401 by default. Opt out with `OPENFANG_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=1`. Fixes the B1/B2 authentication bypass from #1034.
- Agent `context.md` is re-read on every turn so external updates take effect mid-session. Opt out per agent with `cache_context = true` on the manifest. Fixes #843.
- `openfang config get default_model.base_url` now prints the configured URL instead of an empty string. Missing keys return a clear "not found" error. Fixes #905.
- `schedule_create`, `schedule_list`, and `schedule_delete` tools plus the `/api/schedules` routes now use the kernel cron scheduler, so scheduled jobs actually fire. One-shot idempotent migration imports legacy shared-memory entries at startup. Fixes #1069.
- Multimodal user messages now combine text and image blocks into a single message so the LLM sees both. Fixes #1043.

### Added

- `openfang hand config <id>` subcommand: get, set, unset, and list settings on an active hand instance. Fixes #809.
- Optional per-channel `prefix_agent_name` setting (`off` / `bracket` / `bold_bracket`). Wraps outbound agent responses so users in multi-agent channels can see which agent replied. Default is off, byte-identical to prior behavior. Fixes #980.

### Closed as invalid

- #818 and #819. Both reference a knowledge-domain API that does not exist on `main`. Filed against an unmerged feature branch (`plan/013-audit-remediation`). Close with a note to build the proposed validation and stale-timestamp surfacing into that feature when it lands.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Dashboard password hashing switched from SHA256 to Argon2id. Existing `password_hash` values in `config.toml` must be regenerated with `openfang auth hash-password`. Only affects users with `[auth] enabled = true`.

### Fixed

- Dashboard passwords were hashed with plain SHA256 (no salt), making them vulnerable to rainbow table and GPU-accelerated brute force attacks. Now uses Argon2id with random salts.
